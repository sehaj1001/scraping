"This was an extended stay for me (2 months) and the staff and amenities were just right, I could not have asked for more! You tend to build relationships since you are there for a while and it felt like a small community! Thank you (Yvonne, Denise, Elino, Faz, Christina, Vennie, Kayee, Elmir, Alice, Yan Kay, Evan) I appreciate what you do and how you do it, very strong team! The hotel is located right across a huge mall with many places to eat. It was my home away from home, definitely recommend this location for any type of stay.",5,0.9563
Located across from the large Pavillion shopping mall and situated on the main high street.  Can walk to Petronas towers from Pavillion via enclosed Sky Bridge . Good buffet breakfast if you have included and large lounge if you have access. A short walk the the subway so the rest of KL is not far. Many restaurants to choose from nearby.,4,0.4404
"Staying at Westin KL in March just before the lockdown in Malaysia. The services and staff were excellent, esp I was upgraded to the Westin Residence n there were good signage of how to protect yourself amid d Covid 19. The services showed by your staff, esp Mr Ong Boon Yew was beyond the ordinary that made the stay was memorable n comfortable with the extra miles given to ensure the stay was a great experienced by itself. Definitely a 6 stars comfort",5,0.9732
"We recently had a 3 night stay at the Westin KL. Location is great, being directly opposite Pavilion Mall and in the heart of bustling Bukit Bintang. Plenty to do an see around this area, shopping, restaurants and cafes etc. We had a suite which was large and very well appointed. Being a Marriott Platinum Elite member we also had access to the executive lounge which was superb. Staff are first class and our stay could not have been better. Highly recommended this hotel.

Check in and check out was smooth. They could provide me earlier check in. My plan was for 3 nights stay. But i have to check out 1 day earlier for corvit 19. They have refunded my one night payment. Staffs are very supportive and always ready to help. Breakfast was varieties of choices. My suit was on 32nd floor. It was spacious with separate living room. View from the room was amazing. Some electrical switches should be replaced in the room. I was at room # 3207. The electrical socket for hairdryer was in loose contact. Which might be dangerous. Otherwise i really appreciate everything of the hotel. I will definitely recommend this hotel and come back again.,5,0.9229
Thanks for the great service during my short stay (2D1N). Great birthday  cake provided. Kids are really enjoy it. And specially thanks for Yan Kay for her great hospitality. Will hunt for more in near future.,5,0.9705
"I have stayed in Westin KL during the peak of KL Fashion Week for the past 2 years. Many would say that the rooms look dated but for me, they are spacious and comfy. The rooms and hotel service did their job in providing me with what I needed. The hotel facilities are great too. The proximity to Pavilion KL shopping mall is amazing. I just walk a few steps and I've reached the mall! For those who are afraid to walk under the sun or even the rain, you might want to consider this hotel in case the JW Marriot KL is a bit too much for your budget. ",4,0.9622
"We had been to KL many times but this was our first visit to the Westin.  The hotel was lovely and in a great location right across the road from Pavilion Mall.  The staff were all very welcoming, helpful and friendly.  In particular the staff in the Club Lounge were extremely courteous, hospitable and friendly",5,0.9889
Have stayed here for 3 nights on my way to Malaysian islands. There was a little misunderstanding about my card payment while checked in but overall had Wonderfull stay in this hotel. Specially like bed!!!! It was absolutely amazing. The food super ! Staffs are very polite. Location of this hotel was the superb one !! So will be back for sure! ,4,0.9782
"Great hospitality &amp; friendly staffs at the hotel. The rooms are spacious &amp; luxurious. Amazing facilities at Kids Club is one of the main reason we chose to stay here. Cozy and fun with caring caretakers, Shima &amp; Farah are excellent babysitters to our kids. They love to play with kids &amp; our kids love their time there. We would personally like to mention the staffs at The Living Room, Kathryn, Nadya, Shima &amp; Parlan for their hospitality &amp; always accomodating our requests. We are definitely coming back. Highly recommended!",5,0.9904
"It's hard to beat the location of the hotel- it is right in middle of Bukit Bintang and across from the Pavilion.  The staff is friendly and the room is spacious. But the main reason I chose this hotel was its fitness facilities- gym has good number of cardio equipment and weight machines. And also dumbbells and space to do functional training too. With a small fee, you can rent shoes and workout clothes.",5,0.7845
"Malaysia is indeed a beautiful country, but as far as hospitality and service are concerned, there can be significant variations deoending on where you go. The Westin in Kuala Lumpur (Bukit Bitang) is a hotel that I can wholeheartedly recommend for outstanding service and amazing hospitality. I would like to mention staff such as Radha in the Cafe/Buffet area who remembered how I (and my wife and 2 other friends) enjoyed their coffee (without even asking for one first thing in the morning). Halim (Head Chef) took absolute delight in finding out exactly how we liked our food and found ways to escalate our taste buds to never visited before highs. Emmy (Gym) was full of enthusiasm in helping every one of my workouts be an amazing result - even if it was to create room for the",5,0.9945

"Westin @Bukit Bintang is located in the middle of downtown KL - the free GoKL bus stop is less than 20 mtrs from the entrance, and the grand Pavilion KL is just across the road. Plus you've the multiple LRT/ monorail station within a quick walk, for farther off distances.  The hotel itself is massive, and since we were here to celebrate our first anniversary, they gave us an upgrade to a room on the 29th floor. The breakfast spread is spectacular and on our entry into the room, we were also surprised to find a celebratory cake as a token from the management. In-room dining options are fantastic, bathroom is very luxurious and has a bathtub in most rooms. The city view from the top floors are terrific! All in all, for the price (pro tip - check Marriott member rates first!) this",5,0.957
"The Westin is the best hotel in Kuala Lumpur because of the excellent service from Westin staff. I'm really appreciate excellent service from Rique Duty Manager who make my trip memorable. I'm really recommending this hotel to frequent travellers, businessman and family because of Marriott's recognition. The Westin is like my second home when I'm coming to Kuala Lumpur and I really like the new one bedroom residence after refurbish. Special thanks to new General Manager Mr Greg under his leadership. I'm really recommending this hotel because it's strategic location and it's very near to shopping mall(Pavillion) and fancy restaurants. Keep up the excellent service Rique Duty Manager, Tengku Imran front desk officer and Club Manager Mr Said and his teams Elino and Odie and the",5,0.9816
"It's located across from one of the large shopping malls. A short walk from Petronas towers. Price performance for the hotel was good. A good bit cheaper than the JW next door and still a very nice room. Best part was a fantastic breakfast buffet in the morning. One of the best I'd had in a long while with a very wide selection. Some local food, Indian food, good range of fruits and baked goods. Coffee was good,   Take the train into town, getting off at the central station, then it's a relatively short taxi ride in. Enjoyed the lounge for after dinner drinks and relax. Best thing was the location. A short walk the the subway so the rest of KL is not far. Many restaurants to choose from nearby.   Views were obscured by other buildings. The central part of the hotel on my floor",4,0.9912

"Another year, another stay at Westin KL.  Service at this hotel is superb, located opposite the Pavilion &amp; best street shopping in KL. Club Room Cocktails offered drinks and dinner that feel like full board dinner - hot local dishes, soups, salads &amp; more.  Patrons so enthused by the drinks, food in abundance. Staff in attendance and so chatty.  Greg the General Manager is on the floor every day greeting guests. He is amazing. “Said” the club manager, the face of the Club room encouraging patrons to dinIng. We love you Said” and we shall keep coming.  We met “Basco” first time in club room always refilling our drinks and teas, was so good, so passionate.  Food at Westin KL has dishes that vary each day.

"This was a return visit to the Westin Hotel after many years! As business and indeed pleasure will now again bring me (us) back to KL, renewing ties with the Westin was the best thing we could have done. It is a terrific hotel with an amazing location in the heart of the city. A stone's throw away from the Pavillion, Bukit Bintang, Times Square and it just goes on and on.  The recently appointed General Manager, Mr Gregory Gubiani is a gentleman and has what it takes to hold such an important and prestigious position. He is a ‘hands on' GM and has his finger on the pulse and is surrounded by an exemplary team. He has clearly maintained, if not surpassed the standard expected of a 5 star hotel. Thank you Gregory for your generosity and hospitality.  The hotel facilities are",5,0.9761
"We spent a week at the Westin. We had initially booked the Executive room with Club lounge access, however we were pleasantly surprised to receive a room upgrade to the one bedroom suite!   The room was spacious and luxurious. A full kitchen, lounge with TV, a sort of indoor balcony, study, and master bedroom with powder room and en suite.  There was even a knife block, however scissors would have been more handy to have.   The Club Lounge was amazing! We had a choice of breakfast either there or the Living Room. We found the Living Room better for variety and delicious meals for breakfast and the club lounge perfect for drinks and canapes (more like dinner).  We got 2 hours of alcoholic beverages at night to indulge in and they also made freshly squeezed fruit juices plus tea",5,0.96
"Another great stay at Westin KL. Perfect location at Bukit Bintang, opposite Pavilion shopping and dining complex. Absolute awesome service by all lounge staff with special shout to Bosco. Lounge is much appreciated. Looking forward to be back",5,0.9578
"There is one thing that has never changed whenever I come back to The Westin Kuala Lumpur, that is, the bell boy service and manners towards the hotel guests. Always smiling, polite and friendly! This is one of the reasons why I keep on coming back. Kudos to them especially Zarul and Mizi!",4,0.8774
The only thing is the name of the hotel is attractive. The title of the review is summarizing everything. It is 4 stars standard with nice facilities.  It is personal feeling and rating. I did not like because of the unexpected standard and behavior I got.  If you read my review please read other reviews to have a complete picture.,1,0.7499

"Stayed at The Westin Kuala Lumpur for 3 nights. My family and myself were so lucky to have met and being served by the Chef Concierge Mizan and team. The entire concierge team were always ready to assist with every need and concern of the family. Especially travelling with a dad who requires wheelchair for his movements, Mizan and team was there to welcome us and provided express check in and settled us down immediately upon our arrival. Everyday when we came back to the hotel, the doorman and the bell team coordinates the sending of my dad to the room without fail. Over the entire stay Mizan and team seem to have placed on their daily checklist to check on the family's wellbeing till the day of our departure. The Club Team also stood out with ensuring the dietary preferences of",5,0.9196

"Great location, stellar service, especially at breakfast, where Radha and her team (Nadya, Nabila, kathryn and Camelia) were fantastic. The chef at the Masala Station is a truly seasoned professional, who will have an aura of calm friendliness even during the busiest times, but never compromises on quality. Overall, a wonderful experience, which compensates exceedingly for the fact that the property is dated.",5,0.926
"For anyone who loves city life, shopping, modern cuisine here should be the answer. All staffs provide good, customer centric service with fast response. The room is clean but I think the facilities &amp; bed are a bit too out date. Chinese &amp; Italian restaurants inside hotel are good to try. Dim sum is really fresh &amp; delicious. ",4,0.9574
"horoughly enjoyed the service from the staff of Westin KL! Zarul, Azman, Aidil and many more doormen and reception staff were exemplary in their professionalism and helpful with our luggage and any queries. Zarul was the first to greet us when we first arrived, and we were amazed by his passion for service and his flair for engaging guests. We were impressed by their understanding of the international handshake, which showed that they both respected all guests, regardless of gender or religion. We loved the location, and though the interior and facade of the building were abit dated, the service was simply amazing.",5,0.9837
"This was our first stay in a Westin hotel. We found it to be a perfect place to unwind after a two week holiday in Southern India. The staff were delightful, especially Fariza when we checked in, and out, and Camelia in the dining room. They were very welcoming and were just two of the many delightful staff we came into contact with. Our room was spotless, relaxing and had a very comfortable bed. Breakfast in the dining room was magnificent with a huge variety to choose from. Prego Italian restaurant and the coffee room were both lovely spaces to dine in and relax with a latte. We recommend this hotel to others and would not hesitate to stay here again.",5,0.9907

"We stayed at Westin for 4 days, and had a blast! The morning breakfast was awesome and the varieties of food was spectacular and it was also very delicious, quoted my 10 year old daughter Sofie.  The rooms were really clean, and it had everything we ever needed. Pools are okay, and the weather complements the water temperature.  The services that we received from the bell boys, waiters, waitress , receptionists, and everyone was very warmth and up to standard, especially to Mizi the bell boy; keep up the great work!  We will definitely come back in the future.",5,0.974
"Speechless!!! Yes.. had the worst experience having buffet dinner at the Westin Hotel KL.. It was my wife's birthday.. We decided to have dinner at the Coffee House.. It left a bad taste in our mouth.. The spread was so bad, even a 3 star hotel would offer better spread.. The taste of most dishes we tried were terrible.. tasteless.. the oysters were rotten.. Yong tau foo displayed was pathetic, even a food court would do a better job.. Will never, never dine in Westin again.. Left a bad taste in our taste buds..",1,-0.9369
We spent four fantastic nights here and it was our second stay at the hotel.  When we stayed last year we had a few issues which we brought to the attention of Gregory the Hotel's General Manager who assured us if we ever returned he would make things right and he sure did!  Gregory offered us a complimentary room upgrade which was very gratefully accepted. Thank you again Gregory and thanks also for the chocolates and fruit platter.  Things got off to a great start at check-in when Gregory took time out of his busy schedule to come downstairs and welcome us and even accompanied us upstairs in the lift.  We had an amazing room on the 32nd floor with sweeping views across central KL. I could have sat and looked at the view all day and all night.  The room was very spacious and,5,0.986
This hotel is perfectly located in the most prime location in KL Right across the street from Pavilion Mall 5 minutes from Jalan Alor night market 8 minutes from KLCC park and the twin towers. Can't think of a better location for a hotel.   Nice pool area and fitness facilities. Breakfast buffet was outstanding with so much selection and everyone was so helpful and friendly. Executive lounge is on 3rd floor and nice as well. Happy hour from 6 to 8pm but kids only allowed until 7pm in case you are coming with family for your awareness.,5,0.9215

We had a lovely stay and all the staff made us feel like royalty. A real first-class operation.

The suggestions and recommendations were right on point and their professionalism is unparalelled. Thank you to all and we miss you already.,5,0.9183
Hotel is located in the shopping center of Kuala Lumpur and 15min walk from Petronas twin towers. Typical Asian kitchen with broad variety. Swimming pool is rather small but there were not so many people using it.,4,0
"Just arrived back home after staying at The Westin in KL. From the moment you arrive at the Hotel you are made to feel very special to be welcomed into the Westin family. Nothing is too much trouble, everything is taken care of and any queries are dealt with quickly and efficiently.  We booked a couple of day trips through the Hotel which were City Tour and a day trip to Malacca were great. A special mention here to Mizan the Chief Concierge, he always remembered our names throughout our stay and gave us some advice on a number of occasions to enhance our stay in KL. The rooms and restaurants are lovely and wouldn't hesitate in recommending staying at The Westin.",5,0.9564
"A shout out to the delightful and very helpful Mr Tengku Imran who helped with our check in. He apologised innumerable times that our room was not yet ready; he did not have to as we arrived before our check in time.  We noticed the remodel of the lobby and Mr Tengku revealed that the room renovations have been paused for the peak Christmas, New Year and CNY period. Unfortunately due to the hotel running at capacity, we did not get to stay at the renovated rooms, and hope to do so when we come back next year! I hope that the charm of the the traditional design and dark colour wood pairing with marble countertops would be retained though...   All rooms should already sport new 55 inch Android TVs and Nespresso Coffee machines. A significant downgrade and cost cutting measure",4,0.9197

"I stayed here on the Christmas eve holiday and it was very crowded. Fortunately I was able to check in relatively quickly. The room was adequately furnished with a nice bathroom. Full amenities are provided. The club lounge is spacious but very crowded during the cocktail hours in the evening. I was told that there were no more tables and had to return  later. There was generous amount of alcohol provided together with a good selection of food in the buffet. The gym has a sauna but no steam room. Due to the no of people, I had to occasionally endure a long wait for the lift. Views from the room were good.",3,0.8176
"Conveniently situated across one of the most expensive and boring (designer shops which you can find everywhere in the world) shopping malls (The Pavilion), the Westin's plumbing is badly designed and run-down. The bar does NOT serve sparkling water and the buffet offers QUANTITY of food, NOT QUALITY in terms of taste. Such a pity as Malaysia boasts good local food - the Westin's offering of, for instance, Indian food was soggy (vadek - doughnut). The sink is badly designed so that water splashes all over the basin and you cannot turn on the overhead shower because the clip was missing (see photos) The hotel is run down. The saving grace lies in its CONFERENCE facilities - large rooms and plenty of space.",3,-0.8793

No question on how was our stay, and not even a goodbye as we walked away from the front desk. No warm hospitality at all. They might be happy to get rid of us. The breakfast buffet at the 1st floor is a daily circus, and one person took 15 minutes to cook two over easy eggs I ordered. There were no one else in front of me. Housekeeping forgets to refill the coffee pods. Front door staff at the lobby provided off/on good service- they greet you or not  depending on their day.

At the Westin, the beds were great and and the rooms were very clean, making life easier. Breakfast had more options than any other place I stayed, including other Marriott brands. The highlight was Mr. Mizan at the Concierge Desk. I needed a conference room for some calls and I was told all of the rooms were booked. Mr. Mizan found one of their nicest conference rooms that was booked but not in use and arranged for us to work there. He also dropped off some items in my room that my colleague left in his room.

"Westin Hotel KL has always been my favourite due to its strategic location - walking distance to many shopping malls in the Golden Triangle area, love their rooms and beds.. their club access, their restaurants and the friendly staffs.   I have joined their hotel membership for the longest time but sadly they will discontinue it starting from 2020. I have stayed in their deluxe city view room most of the time, occasionally one bedroom or two bedroom apartment if I brought my kids along for staycation. Love the club access especially during the happy hour where I can drink limitless bubbly, red wines and white wines.. plus the food.   The only thing that I don't like is the swimming pool where the water is quite freezing cold most of the time. ",5,0.8605

I do look forward to what Westin KL has to offer after the upgrades are done.  Service has improved tremendously and the lounge staffs are very proactive. Lounge during breakfast and evening cocktails has much more to offer. I very welcome move by the management. This would keep them more competitive when it comes to the lounge service if compared to many other properties around. Elite recognition was good. Was upgraded to the Presidential Suite, I love the amount of space you'll get and the view of the city in this room is just beautiful.

All the major shopping centres are nearby, like Pavilion and Fahrenheit 88. The Westin KL is a great place to stay. However the only hiccup is the location of the reception lobby. Located at Ground floor but the elevatpr from the carpark goes up to Upper Ground floor UG. So if you come up from basement carpark and with ĺuggage, you will need to carry it down the front staircase. ",5,0.9503

"As a Beyond Dining member for numerous years, Westin has always been our favourite choice to stay due to its location and friendly hotel staff. Christina from the Club Lounge always took great care of us. She is both friendly and attentive. Would highly recommend!",5,0.95
There was a very kind and wonderful support provided by Aina and Farah from the business centre. They made sure that the parcel which arrived after my check out gets delivered to my home country.. Very prompt and kind support. Thank you!,5,0.9676
"The Westin was the perfect choice, as I had meetings in the KLCC area. For a tourist looking to experience the downtown area, it is also a great choice - right across the road from the Pavilion Mall, a short walk to the Twin Towers, or Jalan Alor street restaurants. The hotel was opened in the early 2000s, and although the amenities date from then, they feel a lot newer. The rooms are a generous size, with all the Westin trappings. Service was friendly and very efficient. The bar has a relaxed low-key vibe and - if you can tear yourself away from the local food all around - Prego, the hotel's Italian restaurant is excellent, The food is reasonably priced and extremely good, including exquisite wood-fired pizzas.",5,0.9808
"Have been staying in Westin KL for the past 1 year due to work assignment. It never failed to provide a wonderful and personalized experience. Especially thanks to staff such as Teng Ku, Wan Yew and Bosco. They always remember guests' individual preferences to assist accordingly and readily available to help. Look for them if you are around in Westin KL.",5,0.9061
Stayed here late October for partners birthday in an Exec room with lounge access. Have stayed here before 4-5 years ago. I noticed some changes at breakfast and beds there is no heavenly bed just a cardboard bed with stained sheets and a reduced breakfast in the main area. Business lounge totally disappointing with service food variety and coffee let's not start on the dish water that gets served.  No friendly smiles or hellos like in the past . For the money there is amazing hotels that value return business.,3,0.9023

"Redeemed Marriott points for a family holiday at short notice, when I arrived at the hotel The Club Lounge manager Elino saw that I had young children so he arranged for an upgrade to a newly refurbished one-bedroom apartment at the Westin Residences. This really made my day, and my children really enjoyed their stay in an apartment that really felt like Home Away From Home.",5,0.8852
"I booked thru hotels.com for an executive room, upon check in the staff gave me my room card which was at the 19th floor and a club card info for the benefit. Upon going in the elevator I noticed the club rooms are from 31st to 35th. So I called the front desk n ask what's the difference between the premium and executive rooms, she explained premium are from 20th floor to 30th and executive are from 31st to 35th. Shoot I paid for freaking executive which is $60 more and given a room even below premium.  And she explained all the executive rooms are fully book. So she passed me to the duty manager which explained to me that I was in the premium room and between premium room to executive is only 1 ringgit difference and offer to transfer me the next day. I went down n demanded",1,-0.4767
"Stayed there a few days ago. It was a great hotel with the best location right in front of the mall and the main bukit batang area. Amazing service from room service, front desk, doorman and orhers.  Bathroom sink or the faucet needs to be replaced immediately in room 3401. The water in the faucet is so fast that it flies all over the bathroom and the mirror when you even try to wash your hands. ",4,0.9201
"Stayed here for 3d2n and had a great experience over the weekend. Room is clean and spacious, location is convenient (opposite to pavilion, 5 mins walk to farenheit and other nearby malls and about 10 mins walk to jalan alor). Traffic can be pretty heavy during peak hours. Linkway to KLCC is accessible via Pavilion mall. No spa or massage location on site, but services can be ordered directly to the room.  Our compliments to Tengku Imran and Dillah for their warm and hospitable service (even remembered our faces throughout our stay). Will return here again to spend more days in kl.",5,0.8689
"A very good check-in experience by Marc who explained that the hotel was full and the best the hotel could upgrade me (as a Titanium) to was an Executive Room on a high floor (thanks). The gentlemen at the doors were also friendly and would give you the widest smiles every single time. Another gentleman at the front desk (Yew) also offered highly professional, efficient and friendly service.  Room was clean, but needs more light particularly at night. Air-conditioning is weak at best. While the water pressure at the shower was strong and the hot water came on quickly, the plumbing was making a tremendously loud noise whenever the shower is in use.  Location is excellent. Doesn't take you long to walk anywhere within the KL City Centre.   What really left a bad taste in my mouth",4,0.9461
"Below my expectation. But my fault because I expect more from the hotel. location wise, super awesome. So just went to the malls easily . However, no newspaper, no bath tub soap or salt. Hm. But the marriot apps is easy. You can just check-in and check out via whatsapp. ",3,0.8834
"Having stayed at The Westin, Kuala Lumpur for 3 days from 15/11 to 17/11, below is our observation.  Good points: 1. Excellent bell boy service. Upon arrival at the hotel, we received warm welcome back. As we have been loyal customers since 2012, most of the staff can recognise us well.  2. Efficient check in and check out service.  3. Clean and tidy room. Carpet and the sofa are new.  Bad points: 1. Breakfast has gone downhill. Westin is popular for its breakfast, in that, it offers a full pledged bakery store as part of the breakfast. However, the roti man used to be the celebrity who made the roti in full public view where people could stand by and wait for fresh roti. But God only knows why they tuck the roti man around the corner where no one can see him, not to mention",4,0.967

"Love the convenience of this hotel. This is a very busy street with many high end shops and malls. Walking distance to Chinatown and great food. Very close to all major attractions if you plan to take the MRT.   I stayed in a suite and I loved it. It had 2 bed rooms and came with 3 beds. Each room had a private bathroom. There was kitchen, dinning and living room. Since I purchase the suite, the club service and breakfast was given to me as a complimentary. The staff member was super helpful and friendly. I had a late flight so I was able to leave my baggage there and pick it up when I plan to leave. They offer changing room which I recommend letting them know ahead of time so they can accommodate. There is only 1 safe in the room. One thing I would like them to add is the",5,0.9875
"As always, great stay at the Westin. Friendly and good service staff especially at the Club Lounge. Bosco and Adhar were extremely helpful. They both made my wife and I felt very much at home, with the level of friendliness and service level I expect from Westin and being a Titanium Marriott Bonvoy member. The food at the Westin is also something that am very satisfied with over the years. Great Kitchen team !!  Definitely deserve another Leisure Weekend visit soon :) Thank You",5,0.9852

"I would start by saying the service here is generally good...sadly however it's usually when something in the hotel has failed.   On initial checkin it was generally quick and easy, I got a king room that was relatively spacious. Bathroom was also spacious but I noticed the shower area had mold on the grouting and the work they did to refresh the grouts was pretty much a patchwork.   When I turned on the faucet at the sink, the drain was faulty and water started dripping onto the floor at a large volume. I called for assistance and they promptly responded and someone was attempting to replace the leaky pipe. Not having the time to worry about plumbing in a supposed five star hotel I asked to be moved to another room. They again promptly acted and moved me but the same issues",3,-0.4019

She mentioned that today club room is fully packed and I have been upgraded for free to President Suite! The highest tier room in Westin KL.   Feeling excited, I check in and explore the President Suite. At first I was lost as I couldn't locate the room as its room number is hidden from the directory, luckily there is a housekeeping nearby so I could ask for a lead to my room.

"This review will most likely draw a standard reply and probably more information will be requested (which I think is a waste of time as I have also read the Average, Poor and Terrible reviews for the past 2 years). I have stayed at enough Marriott properties in the past decade and the current combined SPG properties to confidently say, this particular Westin property in KL is totally out of the league.  First, with the premium rates Westin KL is charging, I can confidently say JW Marriott right next door will give you much better rooms, better service, better parking, better F&amp;B and much better overall experience. In line with many who have stayed at Westin KL with disappointments from different perspectives (bedding, toilets, pond of water in shower area, carpets, service",2,0.9008
"We just spent three days at the Westin in a club room and loved the hotel . Previously stayed at the Ritz Carlton next door so  wasn't sure what to expect.   The lounge /club access is one of the best I have seen with great selection of hot and cold meals for serving between 6-8. Lots of attentive staff to refil your drinks. They also do fresh juices. We had breakfast in main breakfast area as greater selection of food and it was excellent with good selection of Malay, western and Asian as well as healthy options so all covered.  The pool and gym are excellent with lots of sun on the pool. Great gym and sauna.   Rooms on club level were great. We stayed in 3104 and while it did not look out to BukitBintan  road it was on quieter side. Good size bathroom and excellent shower",5,0.9937

As a platinum elite member in mariott and for someone who spends nearly 100 nights in hotels this property leaves you wondering how do they get everything so right. Just a few examples   1. The concierge Mizan is amongst the  best I have met in the world. I recollect the concerige in intercontinental in sofia who had surprised me with his knowledge. Mizan not only surprises you with his knowledge but also his patience and pleasant engagement   2. The lounge service on the 3rd floor is the best lounge service I have ever experienced. Till now my best benchmark was the Grand Hyatt hongkong but the food choices here even outclass that. The staff are patient and ever smiling   3. The generous linen in the bathrooms give you a feeling of indulgence   4. The breakfast in the lounge,5,0.9905
"A wonderful welcome home - Balik KL We lived in KL eight years ago and wanted to walk down memory lane. Thank you Westin for giving us a wonderful home to stay in, your hotel staff were so welcoming on arrival and throughout our stay. We loved chatting to the staff asking them about their passion. What a great way to open conversation and find out a little more about your lovely staff. The room was exceptional, thankyou for the fantastic invite to the executive suites as we stayed over the weekend. The executive suites have amazing city scape views, the rooms are spacious and the bed and pillows were very comfortable, wish we had more time to enjoy the bath.

The food at Senses was very delicious even at times it was a little slow, the service was still excellent. So thank you very much.   Excellent location as it's across from the Pavilion Mall and night life so I could not have asked for more with thanks to arrangements by Marinique (CEO &amp; Founder of Haute Grandeur Global Awards) months in advance.

The room was decent enough and of course the Weston bed is always good to sleep in however there are now many good five star hotels in the vicinity and it needs to up its game to keep up with the competition.
