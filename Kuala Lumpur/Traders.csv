"We stayed here for 3 days on our way to bali, this hotel is very nice,all the staff are friendly and courteous. Our room was fabulous with a view of the petronas towers and the park,couldn't have been better. The room was a good size with a large comfy bed. Couldn't fault it. Would definitely recommend and stay here again.",5,0.9505
We stayed 3 nights at the end of Feb beginning March. Stayed on Club level with astounding view of Petronas Towers from our window. The service throughout was excellent by all staff. The care under current difficult health situation was great to see and experience. Food wonderful for breakfast and the meal we had at Gobi upstairs was also excellent. Would certainly recommend.,5,0.9738
Modern hotel centrally located for sight seeing .  Very enjoyable 3 night stay in a Club executive room . Friendly and professional staff . Excellent service in the club lounge . Fantastic view of the towers from our club room which was spotlessly clean and modern and well worth the extra cost considering the daily complimentary 2 hour bar and snacks. A couple of things prevent me from giving the hotel 5/5 . The 'hot' options at breakfast were lukewarm at best and the food selection is geared more to Asian guests rather than Europeans. The air-con in our room was inefficient . However I would have no hesitation in staying at this hotel again and would highly recommend it . Top Tip   -  Use the Grab taxis (  equivalent of Uber )  for city travel . Rediculously cheap and friendly,4,0.9858
"What an amazing hotel Traders is. Clean, friendly and everthing you want from a hotel. Upgraded to a room with a view of the Petronas towers which was amazing. Staff were brilliant and the breakfast was superb. We had our temperature taken every morning which as assuring under the  current Coronavirus outbreak. Hand sanatizers everywhere in the hotel. Locaiton was great, at the edge of a beautiful park and only a short walk from shops and restaurants. All in all, fantastic Hotel",5,0.9906
"Beautiful view of the twin towers, very helpful staff and warm welcome. Lovely spa, we had a couples massage and really enjoyed it. Location is excellent, walking distance to large shopping mall and easy access to public transportation. We definitely will stay again next time",5,0.981
"The hotel is comfortable and clean and service is good. My favourite of all is the room, the bathroom and the views from room and Sky Bar. However this time round I found 2 things to be below expectations - the breakfast buffet and the leakage in the room which was quickly rectified but caused me to not be able to sleep the night before. I acknowledge this is a problem with wear and tear and wouldn't fault the hotel on this but the buffet breakfast left me disappointed. Food wasn't great and labels were unclear.",4,-0.8318
On our final full day staying at this hotel which is in a great location near Petronas towers. Very convenient for getting around and staff very helpful and friendly  We booked a room On the club floor which gives you access to a nice lounge for breakfast ( good variety) Snacks and soft drinks and cocktails 5 to 7 with a good variety of snacks and a wonderful separate menu to cater for my vegetarian diet. The staff are lovely and eager to please. There is monitoring of your body temperature  And plenty of hand gel to use  The rooms are well stocked with iron hairdryer tea and coffee facilities,4,0.9881
"Spent a night here whilst travelling from Bangkok to Singapore.  Perfect.  Chose this hotel for the views of both the Petronas Towers and KLCC Park...I was not disappointed.  My Petronas Towers facing room was clean, comfortable, modern and the bathroom was spacious and very welcoming after 24hrs on trains.  Excellent service from door-to-door; the reception even organised a taxi to drop me off at my Singapore bus departure point.  Be sure to save room for the buffet breakfast...it'll set up any weary traveler for the day.",4,0.9659
Stayed here for 2 nights before returning home. Traders is really well situated go for a tower room and see the amazing views of the Petronas towers. Also views of the park and the dancing fountains in the evening. The rooms are a good size and lovely and clean. Breakfast is good plenty of choice.  It's within walking distance of KLCC mall they also provide a buggy service if you don't want to walk.,4,0.9571
"Screened by security at both entrance, friendly checked in by their staff with welcoming drinks. And of course very nice environment in the luxurious room and very great choices and varieties of breakfast menus. Only walking distance to KLCC and the park. Great choice.",5,0.9642
"Employees RE ONLY INTERESETED IN REALLY HIGH VALUE CUSTOMERS. Normal club customers do not get any service. Out of red vine, no offer, beer selection without a IPA-no offer, no understanding. no knowledge. Poor service. Rooms without any service, better to stay at the cheapest alternative.",1,-0.7183
"Hotel arranged our car to and from the airport, which was added to the room charge.  When we arrived at reception for our three night stay, we were asked if we would like to upgrade our room.  The offer included breakfast, free cocktails and snacks between 5 and 7 in the evening, access to club lounge and a room with a view of the Petronas towers, all for MYR730.  I do not regret in any way, saying yes and accepting the upgrade. Our room was 2713 on the 27th floor, with a wonderful view of the towers and the park. There is a good sized pool on the 33 floor, next to the Sky bar. Buffet breakfast was excellent, everything that I could possibly want. There is an electric car, which takes guests from the hotel to the shopping centre (KLCC) just beneath the towers.",5,0.972
This is a good hotel and if I could I would give it 3.5 stars.  Our room had a great view but was a little dated. Breakfast was disappointing and pretty chaotic - the card system on the tables didn't work as the over enthusiastic staff cleared your table the minute you left to get something else.....    We paid for a club room and in comparison to others we've used it was pretty disappointing in terms of drink choices and snacks.,4,0.6249
Located next to KLCC  and walking distance to the Petronas Towers (you can use the free buggy if you dont want to walk).  Breakfast is so good with many different cuisines. Fills you up till dinner time.  They say its a 4 star but I would call it a 5 star.,5,0.5283
"We recently staged for one night before heading to Borneo. The hotel is nice with large rooms ( we were lucky to have a view of Petronas towers). We had dinner in the hotel and the noodles were delicious. Not very busy (lack of Chinese tourists) Outside is a lovely park and you are very close to the KLCC mall. The shops are a mix of high end and street market blogged. In the mall is the subway station, we travelled from there to Batu caves (change at KL Central but very easy) for about 5 ringets (£1 at the time) return. No charge to get into the caves so watch out for tours that charge more. We are at Hakka, 5 minute walk and the food was delicious but service very quick.   The only negative was the sky bar. Fantastic views to the towers but there are booths at the window so",4,0.8641
"I stayed at the Traders Hotel for two nights on my way to Indonesia.  I had two adjoining rooms with my family on the 19th floor with spectacular views of the towers. Breakfast selection was good.  There were measures in place for the coronovirus and that was reassuring.  The location was excellent, joined to the KLCC park and close to the mall.  We managed to get to the top of the Petronas towers and enjoy the lake symphony show every evening.",5,0.9231
"Visited 4 nights begin Feb on route to Australia during virus problem. The hotel was very good with precautions - taking temperature readings on entry to hotel, restaurant and bar pool. All restaurant staff wore masks and gloves. Felt reassured as much as could be.  We had a fabulous view of the Petronas Towers overlooking the park - well worth asking for Tower view rooms. The bedroom was clean and spacious - huge bed. We had a good breakfast with large range of choice. We ate out evenings so can't judge meals. The pool on top floor was enclosed and usually had the windows open - great when a breeze but quite hot otherwise as fans were not always on. Nice view especially at night.  The location next to the park is also a great plus. You have a feeling of space and there are some",5,0.9455
"We stayed here for a two night stop over to see the sight of KL. Great locaiton and weould definatly recomend paying the extra for a towers view room.  Good breakfast but busy, restauraant food good but lacking atmosphere, good wine selection.  As all hotels you pay a little extra for the convenience.  Good size rooms, very cean and good location.",5,0.9565
"Once again we chose Traders Hotel for our stay in Kuala Lumpur and, as usual, we thoroughly enjoyed it.   The staff are so lovely, especially Theresa Goh, the Director of Communications at the hotel: she's a star, so helpful and professional, a great asset for any hotel group. Thank you! The hotel is also very health conscious at the moment with antiseptic gel provided everywhere, free body temperature checks and fantastic room cleaning. The gym has everything one needs and fantastic views too. We truly enjoyed using the running track in KLCC park as well, which is right in front of the hotel: step out and you are in the park! Couldn't get any closer!   Of course the rooftop pool and open air Sky Bar are very famous features of this hotel too.  The breakfast buffet is incredibly",5,0.9913
"The hotel was very quiet because of the coronavirus outbreak but the service offered was excellent. The staff were courteous and went out of there way to be helpful i.e. given breakfast in a bag for an early flight out of Kuala Lumpur. The Skybar is also very atmospheric. If I returned to Kuala Lumpur, I would stay here again.",5,0.9349
"We stayed here in our way back from Vietnam and it was a great way to end the holiday. We couldn't get tickets for the Petronas but in fact we got a much better view from the hotel! The roof terrace and pool is the best place for sunset drinks.  The location is great, right in the middle of town, with excellent access to the malls and restaurants.  Everything was whst you expect from a hotel of this level- can't fault it.",5,0.9735
"My friends and I stayed here for four nights. The staff were helpful and friendly. Breakfast is buffet style with a large choice of eastern and western style foods. The hotel is a short walk away from the petronas towers, but also offers a complimentary buggy service, which helps. Our rooms were spacious and cleaned daily. There is a daily tourist tax of 10 riggit a night, and also they require a deposit returnable on check out. ",5,0.9062
"Pretty much the perfect hotel! Great location,rooms excellent,  great laundry service.  Breakfast  buffet has a huge range of food and last but not least the guys on the concierge desk, especially Badrul, were so helpful. They gave me so much information on where to and what to see,also booking a bus to Singapore for me, all done with charm and a big smile. Thank you Badrul! All in all a great stay and would not hesitate  to recommend.",5,0.9865
"Hi, we were in KL for 6 nights out of which the first 4 days were at another hotel and the remaining last two nights were at Traders KL. The only reason for our change in hotel was for the view of the Petronas TWIN towers.  Though I wanted all 6 days to be at traders but since the cost was too high for a room with the view we decided to split the stay . And I am glad we did because though the room ( deluxe double room ) had the best view of the tower it didnt quite meet our expectations in terms of service .To start with room size was pretty small ( but that's the least of the problem) , I had called in for housekeeping and since I had come back from my trip early I was in the room while the cleaning was going on and I must say I was disappointed!!  There were tags that had",3,0.9106
"Last weekend I visited Kuala Lumpur with my Mom to enjoy a relaxing weekend from the stressful Jakarta. We booked a room for one night at Traders out of curiosity. When we arrived, a receptionist, Michelle Lee assisted us with the check-in process. The process was quick and thorough though she will be much more beautiful if she put on more smile. The room we stayed in I think was the most standard room with the city view (not the twin tower view). The room was great! The design is somewhat vintage and old but still has the luxury feel coming from it. At night, I visited SkyBar which is located in the hotel as well. The place has the best view I've ever seen in KL with the glimmering and shining Twin Tower as your scenery. In my opinion, this is the must visit place for",4,0.9504
"Stayed at this hotel just one night on route back to the Uk. Only hotel in KL with full frontal views of the Petronas Towers &amp; offers dramatic city skyline views.  33rd floor open air roof top Sky Bar, a little odd that the swimming pool was squashed in the middle of it &amp; some of the seating area around the bar, although the under cover, had got a little wet following a very heavy downpour. That said the views were awesome. Walking distance to the shopping mall &amp; Petronas Towers complex either through a park or covered walkway that connects the conference centre facilities. The shopping mall holds mainly designer shops so don't expect to find bargains here. Plenty of places to eat &amp; drink if you want an alternative to eating at the hotel.  Easy access to the Petronas Towers from",4,0.796
"A two week stay at Traders Hotel in KL was (again) very hard to fault. The location is perfect, close to the KLCC park and all the shopping that one could possibly want. For those ‘of an age' or just plain lazy like me; there is a shuttle buggy that runs from the side door of the hotel to KLCC shopping centre from 0800 til late. The staff at this hotel are polite and efficient and certainly not overbearing. The front desk staff were all well informed and able to provide cogent information on the location of attractions and services around the hotel. The rooms are well equipped and, if I had to pick a fault, I would say the room lighting was less than perfect. A little dim for my personal preference, especially when working in the room. There is a standard range of TV",5,0.9058
"I stayed a total of 3 nights. Bed and pillows were comfy, room was clean. Although location is not as good as staying at Bukit bintang area, this hotel is directly connected to KLCC. Easy to get grab.   Breakfast spread is good and available from 6am to 10am in the morning.",4,0.1994
"Stayed at Trader's Hotel for a day.  I will give 5 stars for it 's excellent location, friendly and timely service, and superb facilities.  However, upon booking, there was no indication at all that i'd be charged separately for the airport pickup and tranfer when we checked out.  Thought all along that this facility was part and parcel of the hotel's service. This hidden cost therefore marred an otherwise enjoyable experience.",4,0.8979
"Really nice place for afternoon drinks, easy to get to and fabulous views from the Pool Area. Highly recommended when you have the time, especially in the evening. Little pricey for the drinks, but well worth it....., don't  pass this place up. Check our the photo.......,",5,0.8671
Lovely stay at Traders Hotel Excellent location  Great services Concierge staff very helpful and friendly Housekeeping really good Opt for Twin tower view-Stunning views in the night  Use GRAB for taxis- lot cheaper to go around SURIA KLCC mall very close by for food  Hotel is very clean  Did not opt for BnB as bit on the pricey side  Would stay here again ,5,0.976
"Twin towers room, fantastic views, day or night from lovely room, we had a club room and used the club lounge, well worth extra as free drink And snacks for 2 hours with great views. Pool is very nice and is perfect temperature. Service is impeccable and nothing is too much trouble. Ice machine on each floor  Only complaint was breakfast was a little ordinary, plenty of choice but a little lacking in taste and refinement.",5,0.8846
"My husband always wanted to stay at this hotel for the view of the petronas towers. Upgraded room to ensure view of towers and the view did certainly not disappoint. Hotel facilities good, breakfast excellent choice, gym facilities excellent. Found the pool in the bar area a bit unusual and put us off using it. Tried the sky bar on one occasion but very loud and worried I may slip into the pool when walking around. We were looked after though and when my husband asked about sitting in a booth area with petronas towers view we were accommodated as there was availability. Ate at the Goba upstairs restaurant and food and service excellent. There is a shuttle bus to the mall under the towers but we walked through the park area generally. Would definitely revisit if back to KLCC.",5,0.9347
"A very disappointing experience - we went for early cocktails after a day of sightseeing and if it hadn't been for the view and the need to sit down for a drink we would and should have left. It is a rather shabby pool area with a bar seemingly as an after thought. The pool is surrounded by yellow warning signs and mine tape on steps, the seating doesn't face the amazing view and most is in the wrong side of the pool for it, the cocktails were poor, ladies loo was cramped and dirty and the service was lack lustre at best. Visit Vertigo Bar instead which is everything a rooftop bar should be!",2,-0.8217
"Great location, generous size rooms more of a business travellers hotel rather than for tourists. Contemporary decor. Breakfast excellent but restaurants for lunch and dinner not great but convenient. Staff exceptional ! Service from all the staff we came in contact with was just brilliant. No only professional, courteous and efficient but also delivered with and air of kindness and a perception of your preferred needs. Very special. Would definitely stay here again.",4,0.9785
"We booked 2 rooms during our international travel to Kuala Lampur From Dec 29th to Jan 2nd.  Here was our experience:      - Check-in took 45 min at the counter (the guy at counter was extremely slow and all over the place even when we asked basic question)      -  They used our credit card and stated they would be a temporary room block and will be refunded. To this date (11 days later) It has not been refunded and their customer service is not responding to emails for a values on $300  -  Finally, upon entering our room, we did a quick inspection and found that the toilet had not bed cleaned and there were dry brown water marks all over the seat. We called housekeeping from a secondary room as our phone was also not functional.   They immediately sent someone to fix this, but",1,0.1779
"We booked two connecting twin tower view suites for two nights.Overall I was very pleased with my stay there. the room was great with beautiful twin tower view and and KLCC park. The rooms were modern, spacious and with all the amenties you would expect from an international hotel group (including a roof top swimming pool and bar, although please note they are shut on Sundays). The bed was comfortable and the bathroom nicely done.The staff were very friendly and provided an excellent service. The location is excellent - right opposite the KLCC (Petronus Towers) and only separated by a large formal garden/park. The hotel provides a really useful (and free) shuttle service on a large electric golf buggy to the KLCC which runs every 10 mins or so and operates until 10.00pm (great",5,0.9878
"Booked dinner at Traders Gobo Upstairs. Service was good. Asked for wine, 4 out of the 6 choices were not available (quite strange) felt sorry for the waiter as he was embarrassed. Finally asked for anything on the page except Cabernet Sauvignon.....and you guesses it he brought a Cabernet Sauvignon. Food of a good standard, restaurant lacked atmosphere. Fairly expensive for what was served.",3,0.4588
"We stayed at Traders for 3 nights in a Club Room. We had breakfast in both the main restaurant and in the Lounge. We found that the main restaurant fulfilled our needs better with a wide selection of dishes. Our room was no different to any other similar hotel of this standard and we had no complaints about the room or housekeeping, everything matched our expectations.  We noticed in a previous review about the way guests using the Club Lounge during the early evening were misusing this privilege and basically having meal and drinking as much free alcohol as they could within the 2 hour period. The chefs were bringing out large platters of food that were presented in small dishes, but instead of taking 1 or 2 of these dishes they were taking 5 or 6 each and the platter was empty",4,0.1748
"The first Impression count a lot. I've  requested airport transfer via email and they reply promptly. Upon arrival even it was very late (3am) the concierge greeted us with warm welcome and the receptionist very professional, engaging and thoroughly pleasant.   We booked a room with the Twin Tower view (room 2111) have perfect view of Petronas Tower - highly recommend it. The windows are floor to ceiling and the views are revealed each morning via the blackout curtain. The view is unbelievable of the room. It's simply stunning, especially at night!

Two nights here n route to Thailand  A beautiful hotel with views of the Petronas towers.   Greeted by friendly door staff and very helpful concierges  Our checking was extremely smooth and quick  We had access to the traders club with complimentary food and drinks which is always a nice touch  Bed linen and toiletries of an excellent quality and rooms a re large and airy . Powerful showers and large bathtub Breakfast is very varied and of top quality and the buffet room is kept immaculate  I would say this hotel has an excellent management team as every aspect was faultless . I should also mention the staff who were always smiling and helpful  I would definitely come back here ,5,0.9904
Many thanks to the staff at traders for looking after me. I have stayed here for the past 7 years and cannot fault the service given by all staff. A big thank you to Joanne for her prayers for me with my illness. I hope that I will continue to visit traders for many years to cone,5,0.7819
"Excellent location right opposite the Petronas Towers.  Our room had full view of the towers, it was amazing.  The room was large and the bathroom was a good size with walk in shower and a bath.  Comforts included bathrobe and slippers.  There is a walk/run just outside the hotel which is great for early morning exercise.  Bed was very comfortable.   The staff all helpful and friendly.  The concierge was extremely helpful.  Breakfast was included in our staff and had a great selection of western food as well as local choices.  We had access to the club lounge included. Only negative comment was the club lounge.  What I thought this would be was different to what I expected.  I thought it was a place to meet during cocktail hours to have a drink and nibbles/finger food but it",5,0.9455
Honestly I can say this is the best hotel to stay in Kuala Lumpur location wise food wise room and facilities wise everything is flawless  I stayed a room with an amazing view to  the twin towers I asked  for a higher floor room and it was the best. Easy and express check in  I  arrived  two hours before my check in time but they kindly gave me my room clean spacious with a breath taking view Last but not least  Book a room with breakfast you won't regret it. The only thing  I wished for that if the gobo chit chat the restaurant where I had breakfast would have a view over the twin towers. ,5,0.9792
Staff are friendly and helpful. Service was excellent and great location. Very clean room and the best rooftop bar in the area (my personal view). Complimentary parking for in house guest. Can't fault them. Would definitely recommend this property to anyone and would absolutely be my choice of hire In KL. ,5,0.9785
View view view. This is the only reason we booked this hotel.  For the amount we paid we were very happy with location and twin tower view from our room.  They have shuttle service to twin towers very often. Concierge was excellent.  We used GRAB app to go around. Don't use taxi from hotel. You spend double.   ,4,0.8268
"Great hotel close to shopping malls and free buggy ride if your feeling lazy. There is a big park opposite the hotel. Close to twin towers as it's inside the Suria mall.

"My friend booked it for her Bday on the 1st of January. The view was wow, drinks a little overpriced to compare to other similar bars in KL (because of the view mainly). Service was ok, food was also ok. We were supposed to spend 500 ringgit because of the window cabana booking which was fine, but we noticed that couples around us hardly spent as much as we did. Overall, it's a must visit place if you are staying in KL for a few days. The view is really fantastic.",5,0.9089

And I have to say that the Deputy Manager/Quality Improvement young lady the wonder Michelle Lee was just fantastic, she went out of her way to help me (I'm disabled and fall over a lot) to get any breakfast I wanted!

"Room with twin tower view is a must when you stay in Traders. Amazing night view is just right in front you, it'd be particular to watch the new year firework. Unfortunately, we missed it.  Room itself is very spacious, with every amenity that you need. Love the bathroom with both a tub and shower stand.   We have chosen breakfast to be included, however, the breakfast place is very busy and noisy. Perhaps, it's because it's holiday seasons.  There's a wide spread of food (local, Chinese and western), live cooking stations and freshly squeezed juices, but the food isn't really impressive. The skybar is a cool place to grab a drink and enjoy the night view. However, the food and drinks are very overpriced! And the music was too loud at night.   Staff are pretty helpful and",5,0.9764

The room very big all the amenities you need the shower decent hot or cold water. Room clean everday very professional the room so quite had the best sleep the lounge had happy hours 1700-1900 all alcohol, beer and finger foods available the guests to enjoy.

At first i faced some bad experience about housekeeping of hotel but thanks the head manager Chad they changed and upgraded my room. After that everything was good. We were in this hotel only for 2 nights. The room has perfect view of twin towers and klcc park. Actually the hotel has been located beside a very beautiful park and so close to suri klcc mal and pavilion mal which were good location for food and shopping. The breakfast has acceptable variety and quality how ever they could work on the place of serving breakfast which has no window and closed and small environment didn't attract my appetite. They could work on decoration of their rooms and lightening as well a little.At last I must say i recommend this hotel because of location and if you want to reserve room make,4,0.986

Also walking 15 minutes to Pavilion shopping in Bukit Bintang and Food street Jalan Alor. There's a jogging trail in the KLCC park next to hotel. Path is covered with rubberized pavement.

2 couples stayed for a couple of nights for a belated milestone birthday on way to Thailand. Arrived early morning -  were provided early check-in for one of the rooms. During the day birthday cakes/muffins arrived in each of our rooms. Both rooms had great views of the Petronas Towers. On our final day - we had an early flight out - travel breakfast were provided (requested the night before). Great location to for a short walk to the KLCC centre/Petronas towers. View from the sky bar was great. Tip - if the weather is too hot or a bit raining - options to get to the KLCC centre from the hotel are either the complementary shuttle golf cart or underground and air conditioned walkway. Beds were huge and likewise was the variety at breakfast,5,0.9393
"This is the 3rd time I have stayed at the Traders and it was even better than last time.  Check in was fast and efficient; all staff we encountered were super friendly and helpful; and the rooms and Club Lounge looked as though it had a soft renovation since the last time I was here. We always book the Tower View Club Room and my experiences have always been positive so I wouldn't consider booking a regular room. Everyone in the Club Lounge is really friendly and welcoming; the food is tasty and changes every day; we even had breakfast there a couple of times and it was excellent.  My only issue, a small one, was one lady in the club lounge was a bit abrupt. We came back after shopping and wanted to have a beer and we were informed we had to pay for it. We knew that the wine,",5,0.9815

Also, the email subject is Greetings which you will treat it as promotion or spam. Emailed back to them after dealdline but no response. The amount is nothing but very poor communication, unprofessional and how come things can be missing in a five stars hotel after checkout..",1,-0.7498
"Stayed in Mercure Shaw Parade for 3 nights. It was an amazing stay! Staff were exceptional, especially Wilson! He was the best! Food was alright. Location was great, right next to berjaya times Square.  Look forward for another experience with them!",5,0.9457
An excellent stay and good service . This place has good food and the Sky Bar is pretty cool. Music is 80 to 90s and the best part is its not too loud for a past by 20s date guy like me. Found out its part of the Shangrila chain.  so all the more it explains the high standard,5,0.967
"We have stayed in Trader Hotel Kuala Lumpur 3 times now. We choose the room that overlooks the Petronas Twin Towers. The view is absolutely awesome. You can sit there all night long and look at the view and there's also a large clock on the of the buildings which is good to be able to look at through the night to see the time. The rooms are quite good and the pillows are so comfortable that I photoed the labels in an effort to find some of them for myself. The room rate is also reasonable, considering the view. The have a good size breakfast buffet. Well worth the experience and a view you'll always see in advertising and never forget.",5,0.9682
"My 86-year-old mother and I stayed at the Traders Hotel Kuala Lumpur for my birthday, and we had a generally wonderful stay. The hotel communicated with me immediately upon receiving my booking, so informing them of my requests and the reason for our stay was easy. As such, when we arrived, our room had birthday balloons on the beds, sofa and chairs.  The hotel was located in the city center, within the immediate vicinity of the iconic Petronas Towers and Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre. There was a golf cart courtesy of the hotel that brought guests to and from the Suria KLCC every 10 minutes. Thus, shopping malls, restaurants, supermarkets and the Petronas itself were just few minutes away. There was a coffee shop that likewise served sandwiches just outside the hotel.",5,0.8442
"This 5***** hotel has a unique location. Traders hotel in Kuala Lumpur is a part of Shangri La hotels. About the location:  in the heart of Kuala Lumpur, across the Twin or Petronas Towers and KLCC. KLCC, may be the nicest and good looking mall in Malaysia. Traders is a TOP hotel. Whatever you need, eat, ask etc. etc. or expect is is based on a 5***** qualification. In short, needless to list the great nice facilities of this hotel. Try it !!!",5,0.9469
"We chosen this hotel due to the location, right in the city centre. Staff are friendly throughout our stay. The rooms are clean and still in good conditions after all these years. Buffet spread is excellent.",5,0.91
"This is probably our third stay in this hotel over 4 years. First, complements to the management that the hotel is still well maintained. Room is spacious and clean and staff are very polite.  We stayed on the Executive Floor and so have access to the lounge. While the view is good, the food selection during the evening cocktail could be improved. As mentioned, the staff are polite and courteous. However, staff at the executive lounge could be more observant. For example, we were asked multiple times for our room number within the same day when we visited the lounge (even by the same person when visiting at different times).  Location wise, it is nicely located between KLCC and Bukit Bintang shopping area although both needs some walking.   Overall, quite a good choice and value",4,0.9741
"Great location, excellent services, friendly staff and most of all, magnificent view of the Petronas Twin Towers from the rooms as well short walk to the Twin Towers and Suria KLCC Shopping Mall. The hotel is also located conveniently close to public transport or a short taxi/grab ride to Batu Caves",5,0.9536
If you stay at this hotel you should book a suite facing the towers - it's magic! Otherwise I would not recommend. The lounge at top floor could have a better variety and selection for the evenings. Feels like it's same every night many hotels have much better - sister hotel in KL Shangri La has much better. The pool is indoor and it does not feel invited . If you want nice pool areas choose the Oriental instead.,3,0.9229
"I stayed in room 1717. fabulous view of Petronas Towers. Had great nights sleep. Very clean , luxurious . I felt very safe .Delicious choice at buffet breakfast. Had swim every morning with view of the towers. Its helpful that pool is open at 6am. Staff brilliant. .Consierge so helpful with visiting art galleries.I would definitely stay here again its such a great location.",5,0.9871
I checked in for my business trip and the stay in Traders Hotel really make my day. Great hospitality and a luxury hotel within walking distance to KLCC. Really looking forward for my next stay in this hotel. ,5,0.6249
"We were lucky to book a room with Twin Tower view. Spacious and super cleaned rooms, very professional staff, quality toiletries. However, the most what we liked is the view of twin tower. Location is also so good, walking distance to Suria KLCC thru KLCC park. Highly recommend.",5,0.946
"This hotel is located near to Suria KLCC, just 3 min walk away. Depending which direction your room faces it's either a KL Twin Tower or the  Exchange 106 tower view, which are 2 of tallest building in Malaysia. It's a simple hotel but it has nice view from the top. The lobby is location at level 5. The size of the rooms are considered big and comfortable. The staff are friendly and efficient. Only down side is that the hotel doesn't have any conference/meeting rooms as it is just next to the KL Convention Centre.",3,0.9612
"I love this hotel. It's clean, extremely comfortable and has the best views of the twin towers. I visited last year on business and had a great stay. Returned this year with my husband and it was as good as I remember. Club lounge fantastic. The views are amazing (see picture). Staff really nice. The hotel also organised for a car to drive us to our next destination - Penang - for a very good price. I will be back - great hotel! ",5,0.9909
"There are so many great things about this hotel, I am not sure which one to begin with! The location is the best, there is an uninterrupted view of the Petronas Towers. The rooms are of the best quality and the staff are so helpful and professional. There is a rooftop bar with a swimming pool. Nearby there is a huge shopping mall, there is a shuttle service for this, but it is easy walking distance. I am usually not impressed with hotel breakfasts...not here, it is the best hotel breakfast I have ever had. Such a variety of food. This is one of the best hotels I have stayed in, would stay here again. Can't praise it highly enough. I would give it 6 out of 5 in the ratings.",5,0.9633
"Take a look at the yummy pics - Traders' team put pride in whatever they do - even down to room service foods, you can taste the culinary skills and efforts from the kitchen team. This apply also to their front end and back end team! I am a proud Traders/ Shangri-La Hotel supporter and what makes me stick with them is the team there. From friendly check-in staffs like Dom to dedicated corporate account managers like Ari and Adina... they are the main reason for my return as I simply feel ‘safe like home'! A hotel can have the best view &amp; facilities but it's the crew that makes it amazing! ",5,0.9662
"My partner and I stayed here for three nights. Our room had views of the twin towers and other beautiful buildings. There's alot of security there, they scan you and check bags when entering this made us feel safe.  Attached to the other side of the hotel is the convention centre,  here you will find an atm, food courts  and a small aquarium. This is where you should eat as we ordered room service twice and it was terrible. Their Buffett breakfast is to die for though. I have to unfortunately say their indoor pool is very small and had a crap atmosphere and the alcohol is so expensive.  The rooms are clean, staff are great. From The hotel you can walk to the twin towers, and malls. You can also get on the hop on hop off tour bus here. ",5,0.6124
"Whenever I travel to the KLCC area of KL for business conferences or exhibitions, I would choose to stay at Traders Hotel. It's a nice,luxurious hotel just above KLCC. That alone beats all other hotels here hands down on location. KLCC is a mall too, so eating and shopping is a breeze. Plus, if you're  Shangri La's Golden Circle member, Club room/level benefits is the icing on the cake.",5,0.1531

"We stayed for 4 nights en route to Koh Samui. We hadn't booked a club room but were offered a good deal on an upgrade when we arrived, which we accepted. So pleased we did, I loved the room and view, and the club lounge was very comfortable with pleasant and courteous staff. All members of staff we came into contact with were most helpful and I also liked the enhanced security at the entrance to the hotel. Our room was comfortable and within easy reach of the things we wanted to see and get too. I would return to Traders if In KL again and would recommend to others. ",5,0.9954
"A good value and conveniently located hotel. Rooms spacious and comfortable. We were only here for 2 nights and didn't get to use any of the restaurants or bars, except for the ground floor coffee shop. Wealth of eateries in the surrounding area as well as great views of the towers and next to huge shopping mall. Lots of construction in surrounding streets so traffic congestion can be a problem if you are travelling by car",5,0.9485
"Went to stay for one night, the room was avergae &amp; there were some noises as some reno works are being done at my floor. this hotel is really convenient as it is near to the KLCC &amp; Pavilion. they also provide buggy service from hotel to KLCC for hotel guests. but I guess would not come back again - alot of business hotel guests hence feel very noisy especially around the hotel restaurant",3,-0.359
We originally planned to stay here for three nights but ended up staying for five! The hotel staff were excellent and always very welcoming. The rooms were extremely spacious and we opted to pay the extra for a view of the Patrons Towers and weren't disappointed! The club lounge was excellent and had a large variety of snacks and drinks would definitely stay here again if back in KL.,5,0.941
"I stayed for 7 nights for a work event at the KLCC, which is connected. I had a Club Room, which provided access to the lounge, where we could eat breakfast, have a few drinks, meet for work, etc. The room overlooked the park and Patronis Towers that was very well equipped, nearly perfect. The only negatives were small: the hair dryer was connected to a drawer int he living room, not the bathroom; the artwork was hideous, and the water temperature kept fluctuating when showering.  Aside from those relatively minor things, the hotel was quiet and comfortable, bed was amazing, pillows were perfect: two soft; two harder; and staff was wonderful. Nothing was too hard, and they were quick to accommodate. Checkout is normally 12, but they easily extended mine to 2pm. Much appreciated.",5,0.958
This is a GREAT place to stay in KL! It is right next to the park and has a great view of the Petronas towers. There are many things within walking distance. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful. The breakfast was excellent! SkyBar was fun! I could go on and on!,5,0.9753
"On arrival at check-in, after a long flight from Heathrow, I knew I had chosen the right hotel in KL. Our room requests had been observed and more importantly our room was immediately available, far before conventional booking in time.   Our room was spacious, clean and comfortable.   The breakfast choice was good with Malaysian, Chinese and Western dishes.   The location is good, on KLCC park, overlooking the Petronas towers. A metro station is about 10mins walk away and can be accessed via underground passageways.   The staff are really helpful and obliging. On the first day l was urged to install Grab on my mobile to use the cheap taxi service. The staff will also help you with sightseeing and in printing your onward boarding pass.   On the last day we had an early flight, so",5,0.9595
I stayed there for 4 nights as part of my honeymoon and I must say WoW mrs was well impressed and they even decorated the room. Thanks you all at traders 😀 Recommendation would be to book twin tower view suite.,5,0.8979
"We only stayed for 1 night, breaking up our journey from Perth, Australia to Bangkok.  It was a great stay, we had a twin tower view room with club access.   Plenty of drinks and food to choose from and the view of the twin towers lit up at night was amazing.  The concierge at the entrance of the hotel made sure our luggage were taken care of and directed us to check in via the lift.  Check in was smooth and fast and with very efficient staff. Up to the room, followed shortly by our bags. Quick change and up to the pool, amazing views yet again.  Club access as mentioned before with a wide array of choice, breakfast in the morning was greatly anticipated as my partner had stayed here before, I certainly wasn't disappointed.  WOW, what a choice, everything you could possibly wish",5,0.9795
Booked and paid in advance a stay through virgin holidays and upon arrival found the rooms had been cancelled by virgin holidays the week booked  The concierge staff were brilliant and managed to find us some rooms but I had to pay extra with my credit card  Great hotel brilliant location minutes walk-from the petronus tower fantastic staff let down by the travel agent,5,0.9752
"i called for room reservation on 23 September 2019, at round 8pm as my friends are coming to KL for a night stay so i tried to make an inquiry on behalf of them. Jay noted my requests and politely that i'm not complied with the ""hotel rules"" as i requested for a room to accommodate 3 person in a room but not taking the suite room due to limited budget. Jay made it very clear on price difference with and without breakfast (for 2 persons stay) and she went extra to offer me a call back before she could promise me anything (without me asking). in less than 10 minutes, she called back stated that the price that she quoted me earlier for 2 person with breakfast; her manager - Kimmy, approved the request (Deluxe TT view room) for 3 person with breakfast on the same price! even though",5,0.8881
"I stayed here for 5 nights with my husband in an Executive Twin Towers Room. Check in was quick and efficient and facilities, mealtimes etc explained to us. Our room was on the 11th floor with a fabulous view of the Twin Towers and surrounding city.  It was a nice sized room with an enormous comfy bed, seating area and desk/chair which as we were not there on business served me very well as a dressing table - there were electrical sockets inside the desk for the hairdryer etc as well phone charging sockets.  My only niggle was that there was not a nearby mirror but there were two good sized ones and a socket near the door. The bathroom was very large with a bath and separate shower and toiletries were replenished as needed.  The towels were lovely and fluffy.  Everything was",5,0.9472
"Very pleased to return and stay here again. Although hotel is older now, it has not lost its charm. I got a room with view of the twin towers and its an awesome sight at night. Very convenient for me to attend the conference at KLCC. Staff are well trained and acted professionally. Thank you and keep up the good work. ",4,0.926
This place is all about the location. It has stunning views of the towers.  It's a little dated in parts. Mini bar prices are extortionate. Sky Bar is nice but pricey. We didn't eat here as we only stayed one night and did a food tour (recommended and reviewed elsewhere) and had an early flight. Do the tower trip for sure.,4,0.6858
For our first ever trip to Malaysia we decided on 3 days at this city centre hotel. We arrived early around 9am and our club room with Petronas Towers view was ready and what an amazing view of the iconic twin towers we had. The room itself was of a larger size than we thought it was going to be (in our experience city centre hotel rooms can be a little on the small side) it was clean with a very decent bathroom plus very comfortable huge bed plus that amazing view through the large picture window. When booking a club room you get the opportunity to use the club lounge generally it is quieter than the main breakfast room with a smaller choice for breakfast but perfectly adequate with egg based dishes cooked fresh. In the afternoon there are canapés and a choice of alcoholic,5,0.9701
"Yet another wonderful stay at the Traders!  A terrific Hotel with great facilities and in a perfect location. The rooms are exceptionally clean and comfortable.  Staff have once again gone above and beyond and on a general note, surpass themselves on each and every occasion.  A big thanks for making our recent stay most relaxing and memorable.  Breakfast staff (Level 5) and Club Lounge staff (level 32) are really on the mark. Initiative and anticipation of our each and every need was demonstrated on each and every occasion we attended these locations. The impeccable service was only matched by the variety and quality of the food. Most impressive!  Special mention must go the the stalwart and regular staff of the Traders, to include the sheer brilliance of Nizam (who is always",5,0.9906
"I was celebrating my bday with a trip to KL. Upon arrival, I was given a gorgeous rose and my room was decorated with balloons. I also got muffins with happy birthday. Those little touches really make the say personable and make me feel valued as a customer. Room was standard, but clean and comfortable. All the usual amenities you would expect all provided. The location is great. Short stroll to the Suria shopping centre and petronas tower. We also utilized hotels airport pick up service. I believe it was well worth the money for the first timer to KL as it was really convenient, worry free and smooth process. The airport can be very confusing to navigate and I'm glad I used the service. Overall a lovely hustle free stay. The sky bar at the hotel has a gorgeous view of Petronas",5,0.9932

On top of that the hotel is really well located, only a short walk from the iconic Petronas towers and easy access to the light railway system.",4,0.9795
This is an excellent hotel well placed in KL.  Security is outstanding so feels exceptionally safe.  Breakfast is amazing everything you can imagine and more.  Great pool for a decent swim.  Also the bed is so comfortable you don't want to get out of it.  Would highly recommend.  😁,5,0.9844
"The view from the twin tower view rooms is great, but otherwise the Hilton is better. I didn't find any folder with a guide to the hotel like the Hilton in the room. The security at the entrance is also a bit excessive which you don't have at the Hilton. I'm not a fan of going through a metal detector each time you enter.",3,0.8836

This year is Traders Hotel turn. The Hotel is located at the end of Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre and most convenient if you are attending an event there. It is nice walking distance to Suria KLCC shopping mall. You can walk through the underground tunnel or walk around the park and enjoy the view. You could take photo with full view of Petronas Twin Tower, the iconic landmark of Kuala Lumpur.

We stayed four nights on the 24th floor. We had what can only be described as one of the best views we've ever had from a hotel room of the Petronas Towers. The rooms we had were modern and very clean. We had breakfast in the restaurant on the fifth floor that was of a very good standard and plentiful. The towers and associated mall were about 5/10 mins walk away either outside or if you go via the conference centre and then drop a level in the middle you can stay inside in the air conditioning all the way. The hotel does have a buggy service to the towers but we didn't use it. If we ever go back to KL we'd certainly look at this hotel as our first choice. A word of thanks must also be passed to the staff who were always very helpful and polite. ,5,0.9454

Breakfast was good, quite a lot of choice. However, we had made a reservation for the SkyBar and GoBo Upstairs for dinner a few weeks before arriving - SkyBar is not a modern cocktail bar, it has a kids pool in the middle with kids club sofas around the edge for you to sit at to have your drinks. There is a bar area however it's next to the pool on the side with no views. It's set up to be more of a kids club during the day and a club at night which isn't what we were expecting.

The special little extra touches for our anniversary were so nice too. Rose petals chocolates flowers and cakes were lovely. The view really comes to life at night so much so that we slept with the curtains open. The club room gave us access to the lounge in the evening where we had drinks and canapes. This was well worth the extra price paid. The breakfast at Traders hotel is extensive and very varied ,most delicious. All the staff that we encountered were very helpful friendly and professional. Each day we we greeted with a hello and a huge smile. Thank you so much we would definitely recommend this hotel.  ",4,0.9907
"We stayed at this hotel as a stop over on our honeymoon. The hotel and location was fantastic. We were on the 28th floor in one of the club traders rooms and the view was just amazing.  This also meant we had the added benefits of using the club readers lounge for breakfast and afternoon cocktails and snacks. I would recommend this to anyone staying here.  The location means you are close to the twin towers, they also run a buggy service that's takes you to and from the shopping mall which is a nice touch. You also have this like the aquarium with great walking distance. There is also something me great restaurants close by such as Beta KL. ",5,0.9755
