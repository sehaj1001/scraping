"Stayed 4 nights at the Sofitel Kuala Lumpur Damansara with my family and it was one of the best five star hotels we stayed at and we had a wonderful and enjoyable experience throughout our stay. Second time staying at this property and I enjoyed it even better than the first.  The  Prestige Suite is cozy and comfortable.  Comfy bed and duvet blanket. One thing the hotel might want to take note is that it might be time to change the pillows in the room as they are too soft. The pillows are too soft to my liking, it sank in after a while.  I called for a couple of foam or latex pillows but the ones delivered were definitely not what we asked for since they were the same as the ones we had. Although you could ask for a firm form pillow, I preferred the memory foam ones. Keep it up.",4,0.9403
"Second time staying at this property and I enjoyed it even better than the first.  I booked a Junior Suite during the black Friday sale last year, and stayed for 2 nights in March (8-10). Check in was done at the club lounge, and as I arrived late, hors d'oeuvres have began and I got to enjoy it before heading to my room.   I have to say that I enjoy every minute at the club lounge as the staff were very attentive. Special shout out to Srikanth who spoiled us with all the delectable treats in the evening. Breakfast also had ala carte menu, loved the waffles and nasi goreng as well.   Kwee Zeen also boasts an extensive buffet, however due to the ongoing situation I can see that guest numbers have dropped significantly.  My room had no faults, everything worked perfectly as",5,0.9761
"Checked in late evening one day, all went smoothly and breakfast spot is informed clearly as well.   The rooms are spacious and THE BEDS are amazing. One of the best beds we had among our hotel stays. Shower is spacious, large bathtubs. Speedy wifi (free) across all areas too.   Had a tour of the hotel a little bit however had no time for the spa and bar at Nizza's. Maybe next time. Ambience at the bar outside is pretty chill too.   Service is great across reception to the restaurants and concierge, always welcoming and smiling. Hope to return soon and will definitely recommend.",5,0.9847
"After reviewed several Tripadvisor comments, My girl friend and I decided to choose Sofitel Kuala Lumpur to celebrate our anniversary journey.  Receptionist ( Raj ) assisted us to check-in, he was professional, friendly and helpful.  Our room was amazing with anniversary set up which prepared by Excellent Guest Experience Team - ( Clemence, Pierre, Marleen and Juidi ). We love it very much. Thank you for given us a unforgettable memories.  Room was spacious and design was great, we love the bathtub very much. The bed and the sofa chair were comfortable. Hotel location was good and you could take the ‚ÄòGrab‚Äô to anywhere with reasonable price. The Gym room and swimming pool were located on 3/F.  We had the breakfast and dinner buffet on 13/Mar, food quality was good. Tips: if u",5,0.993

"I checked in around 23.30 on March 12th in Sofitel and next morning i went down to the Kwee Zeen restaurant 10.20 which gonna be closed soon. I came inside and one staff (Mr. Rizdwan) i forget sorry:( offering me something to drink, i order chamomile tea and he brought it for me. When I took some fruits, other staff (girl) said sorry because they gonna close soon and maybe if i wanna take some other foods, i said it's okay i am the one who came late. While i was eating, before they close the buffet, Mr. Rizdwan came to me and offered me his help if i want something else. I said it's okay i am good with nasi lemak and fruits that i ate. Then after couple of minutes, suddenly he came again and he brought a small paper bag and i got surprised üòÅ he said ""this one is for you Miss,",5,0.7783
"Visiting the hotel for the 3rd time, I got out of the taxi and was immediately recognized by Vasu. What a brilliant and warm welcome.   Also every encounter the following days with all the staff was very friendly, starting from Nurul at the reception to Shraddha at the lounge to name only two of many.   Summarizing: Rooms: 10 out of 10 Food: 10 out of 10 Friendlyness: 12 out of 10  You don't believe me? Go and try it - you will not be disappointed. It's indeed a great place and I am Looking very much forward being there soon again.",5,0.9574
A great business hotel - probably not the right area to stay in KL if on holiday but very handy for the nearby offices.  Everything was a very high standard from the room decoration and furnishing to the breakfasts.  Minor complaints: low water pressure in the bathroom and some smell from the drains.  Hugely impressive: the quality of the food server in the third floor poolside bar and restaurant. They served some food which was genuinely truly top class.,5,0.7461
"Got an upgrade from luxury to junior suite. The room was spacious and modern, comfortable bed and pillows also a big bathtub. All the amenities provided here is great.

"champagne gate one and two! have stayed at this hotel several times. was very pleased that they served real champagne in the lounge. was surprised when i got there last year and the champagne was removed, contacted the management and got some bad excuses from vincent berry i think his name was. the rest of the stay I got my champagne. prior to this trip I emailed the hotel and asked if they still serve champagne in the lounge, they replied that they did. the first night in the lounge I ordered a glass of champagne and they did not have it just sparkling wine. contacted the management by mail and explained my disappointment and asked to check out after 2 days. received response from the assit front off manager that they had already removed the champagne last year by cost savings.",1,0.9039
"Stayed 4 days in this lovely modern 5* hotel  before leaving for Penang Island.  Very clean, spacious room overlooking the Petronas Twin Towers, (we were on 21st floor, 2nd highest floor) safe, bathrobe, slippers, water, tea, coffee, bathroom, good toiletries,  large shower, everything you could ask a 5* hotel for.  All is quality and good taste. The Concierge was a lovely helpful man.  Breakfast in the Kzee zeen restaurant was amazing with  plenty of delicious European and Asian food.  So much to eat.   Beautiful cocktails and snacks in the Club Millessime.   Lovely pool with lovely outside bar.     The only things I could fault upon, but this is personal, windows cannot be opened, breakfast at the restaurant is soooo cold with the A/C on full blast, and you need to walk a bit",5,0.9672
"We arrived at the Sofitel Kuala Lumpur late afternoon on Monday 17th February after a delayed flight from Heathrow and further stressed because British Airways had ‚Äòmislaid‚Äô my walker without which I cannot walk more than about 20 metres. From the moment we arrived, the Sofitel staff did everything they could to help us relax. We were greeted at reception with a cool drink then taken up to Club Millesime for registration and check-in with the friendly and efficient Myra. She suggested we contact KLIA and get them to deliver the walker to the hotel when it was found.  Our room was spacious and well appointed with the bed made up with hypoallergenic bedding as requested.  There were bottles of drinking water provided, as well as fruit and a small box of delicious chocolates. There",5,0.9559
"Everything was perfect at my 2-night stay at this outstanding hotel, best Sofitel I have stayed so far. I highly recommend it and definitely will return. The room was spacious, modern and with all the amenities you expect from a 5-star hotel.  I really enjoyed the hotel facilities like the reception and pool areas but especially the Club Millesime with a wonderful staff and excellent food/drink options.  The breakfast options were amazing. The restaurant at the first floor offered a great buffet selection and Club Millesime had a great a la carte.  I look forward to return to Kuala Lumpur and this Sofitel.",5,0.992

Rooms are very new and tastefully decorated. Bed is comfortable and room has all the basics to make your stay enjoyable.  Location is next to a small mall so it is very convenient for food and supermarket.  The spa is also very nice; good quality massages.,4,0.9095
"The rooms and bed is really comfortable. As an Accor Plus member, we were offered a welcome drink and love the offerings at Le Bar. The staff there is very helpful and welcoming. The breakfast choice was a little limited and not much vegan/gluten free option. A little hiccups coming from the freshness of the ingredients as there are condiments that turned sour. ",4,0.9292

"The Sofitel KL Damansara is an excellent choice if you don‚Äôt mind staying just outside of the city centre. The rooms are excellently appointed, the service is what you‚Äôd expect from a Sofitel and the amenities are great. If you choose to book the club level rooms, Isha and Shraddiya are lovely hostesses and will no doubt look after you as they did me.",4,0.9186
We stayed 2 nights at Sofitel Demansara hotel as a family with 3 small children. At the check in we were upgraded to Opera suite- which was absolutely stunning. Everything in the hotel was very modern and stylish- we tried dinner in a hotel restaurant one night - excellent food! On breakfasts we really enjoy the a la carte options! I also would like especially mention a guest experience personnel ( a swiss young men) he made us feel very welcome and made sure we enjoyed during our stay. We will definitely stay here next time.,5,0.9743
"Club Mill√©sime @ 22nd Floor, Sofitel Kuala Lumpur Damansara. If you ever get to stay at this hotel, you must try, by hook or by crook, to get access to the club. (Or some call it the executive lounge)  The club is superb. It is quiet, spacious and chic. Breakfast are serve here for the guests with club access. What I like the most is that they will make your breakfast for you as per your order. I had egg Benedict, it was well cooked.  In the afternoon they will serve you tea and coffee. Evening, you will get some free drinks here. Some might say if you so wish you can spend whole day here.... I like it very much here. Their service is impeccable.   How do you get access to the club?  You can book a room with access, or book a room just one level below the one with the club",5,0.9589
" My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 5 wonderful nights for our 30th wedding anniversary. This hotel is situated in Damansara, a quieter area away from the city centre,close to a train station. It is only several stops from the city centre. It's a beautifully decorated hotel, with spacious rooms. Our bed and room was very comfortable, with a walk in wardrobe area and gorgeous bathroom. Breakfast was delicious, with a wide variety of Western and Eastern food to choose from. We had access to the Lounge on an upper floor of the hotel. It was great relaxing there with drinks and food after a day of exploring KL.  Although the hotel is beautiful, what made our stay at this hotel was the incredible staff, they made our stay a special one. Every staff member we met was incredibly",5,0.9861

"I stayed over one weekend at Sofitel Kuala Lumpur Damansara. I only chose this hotel because my good friend from Melbourne was staying at this hotel for his holiday.   I stayed at the Club Room which allows me to enjoy the club facilities. The service at the Club Millesime is fantastic. Check in and check out are as smooth as the overall service delivery. The room is spacious but some of the view it may be blocked due to its close proximity to the next door building. The bed is nice but the pillows are rather too soft for my liking.   The toiletry set uses the luxury brand Lanvin which is quite impressive. And the bathroom is very spacious with separate shower and toilet.    As for the breakfast, I love the selection at the main breakfast hall. Especially the bread section.",4,0.9766
"My wife and I stayed here for a 5 night getaway from a Luxury Escape deal.   Room - The room was a very good size, nice large bed (although it was a bit hard for my bad back), great shower space and pressure, with a coffee machine and daily bottles of water. The view wasn't the best, but then again I didn't pay for the view. Plenty of wardrobe space.  Meals - The breakfast range downstairs was one of the largest selections I have seen. Great quality food and a chance to taste some local dishes. Our Luxury Escapes package gave us use of the club on Level 22, so we had a private breakfast up there away from the crowds, with breakfast choices made specifically for us, which was fantastic. Highly recommend the Mee Goreng Mamak. Of an afternoon, we were treated to basically a high",5,0.9671
"A hotel with a French concept theme. ‚Äî Room is clean and well designed. ‚Äî Hotel associates are friendly. ‚Äî Quite a number of artworks and lightings throughout the hotel which is nice. ‚Äî Caters to mainly Westerners. ‚Äî Nearest MRT station:- Pusat Bandar Damansara. ‚Äî If you have big and heavy luggage, you have to walk a slight uphill to DC Mall about 5 - 7 mins walk. Because their are ongoing construction works for a luxury residence and bespoke retail mall. Hopefully once the buildings are ready, it will be more accessible to reduce the walking time. ‚Äî Breakfast is great with pretty good choice of food and a pastry heaven! All-in-All: Highly recommended. ",5,0.9841

"When I first stayed in this hotel and wrote a review, I mentioned that this is a great hotel in the making.  Well after more than a year and several stays there, I can truly say that it is now a great hotel.  The hotel's occupancy rate has been very good and in my last trip, they were fully occupied.  Despite this, their service level has not dropped.  After checking in, I wanted to have lunch but there was an event in the hotel.  The Chinese restaurant Wan Chun Ting was fully booked and the only place available was Kwee Zeen.  When I went to Kwee Zeen, the main hall was booked by the same event organizer.

"It is a privilege to be able to write a review for the Sofitel Kuala Lumur Damansara.  From the moment that we (Mark, Kate, Emily, Anne and Abbey) walked into the hotel to be met by the concierge staff (Adrian and Renggasamy), the check in staff (a lovely young man who supported Liverpool FC) and the wonderful Anabella at the sensational Club Millesime, it was obvious that customer care and service was at a different level here. We checked in early due to an early morning flight arrival and the exceptional Anabella accommodated us at the Club prior to check in, made me and my family feel like we were really special and provided us with care and kindness for the entire week (thoughtfulness that was was genuine, honest and professional).

Fantastic stay and especially enjoyed Club Millesime.  Paid with reward points earned on past patronage with Accor ALL.   Totally surprised when Sofitel Kuala Lumpur Damansara did not credit me with reward or status points. Their reason? I did not pay by credit card but used reward points.

"This was the first time we stayed at Sofitel KL, it was a lovely comfortable and clean hotel, staff were very friendly and very helpful. It is a little way out of the centre of KL however the hotel provides a shuttle bus one way to the local train station and to some larger shopping centres, it‚Äôs about a 10 minute walk back from the train to the hotel. This train line goes direct to central market, Chinatown market &amp; Bukit Bitang Shopping Complex. It also connects you to other train lines which helps you to get around KL very easily.

Some of the rooms, during my stay, were simply damp and mouldy for some reasons. Am not sure whether it was a wet season that causes this or else.

I had selected two wines to be served with the lunch, a red and a white, in advance via email . The Captain advised me at the lunch that the white was not available. I asked why I had not been advised in advance, to which there was no reply.  So I asked the wait-staff to serve the red. It then became apparent that none of them had a clue how to use a cork screw. Once the red wine had been opened, I then noted that it was being stored in a full ice bucket!  The 15 guests soon drank the one bottle that the wait-staff had provided, so I ordered another. It took an age to arrive as it apparently came from another part of the hotel. Once this was finished I ordered",2,0.3382
"Heading straight to the Sofitel KL from Bali was the ideal way to transition from tropical to city life, and Ollie was treated like the little prince he thinks he is. Although we think that we may have spoiled him now that he only wants to bath in Hermes amenities.  We stayed in the Opera Suite with our 1 year old son and had the best experience at the Sofitel from start to finish. Our suite was enormous with grand floor to ceiling offering stunning views of KL and the highlands. The bedroom was kitted out with the most indulgently comfortable bed, along with a cot provided for Ollie.

Whilst the staff were nice and helpful, the food at Kwee Zeen wasn't impressive. But the staff and food at Niza was better than expected, perhaps because it wasn't a buffet. My biggest disappointment must have been the facilities. The pool had non-functioning jacuzzis, broken tiles, and mosaics that have fallen off. Shows a lack of care for maintenance in the property that is only 2 years of age.

The people at the front office: Muun; Farah; Jacqueline; Amm and Michel. The Concierges; Rengga, Izwuan and Kai they know the best places in the city to visit and eat. The lovely ladies of the Guest Experience group: Emily, Clemence and Anabella, always taking care of the minimal detail and going the extra mile to make us feel valued guests.

"Arriving Hotel was greeted by Concierge Mr Adrian. Booked through Expedia for my 3 nights stay. Arriving hotel before the actual check-in time and the reception was able to get a room ready for me for free. Thank you i really appreaciate it so much.  I did not choose to add on breakfast for my stay as i prefer to explore outside eating local Malaysia food.   Room wise is clean, spacious and bright. Reminds me my room at Singapore Sofitel.  As i was mostly out in the city exploring Malaysia i not able to comment much. Overall stay was good.   Thank you to all the staff i encountered during my stay.",5,0.9702
"Having been to the Sofitel KL a few times since its opening, it is impressive to witness it morphing into a genuine luxury hotel: the hardware was originally good, however the software is getting closer to being great.  The rooms are immensely comfortable with great bed, shower, soundproof, space, and Wi-Fi.  The Lounge is exceedingly comfortable and spacious, with attentive service.  All outlets are tastefully designed and serve tasty food, with particular mention for Wan Chun Ting's Peking duck and Nizza's fish and meat dishes.  The Spa's interior architecture is definitely unique, while the property's overall decoration conveys a sense of timeless and quiet elegance, making the hotel somewhat of a modern oasis providing a very welcome break from KL's hustle and bustle.

Great and excellent friendly service at Restaurant Kwee Zeen for a light dinner with my wife and the service was excellent from Pajesh during the dinner.

"Having the audacity to price themselves with the likes of Majestic Hotel and Double Tree Hilton this hotel definitely did not meet the expectations. We booked 2 nights after hearing good reviews about this place but unfortunately it isn't like what we had in mind.  First of all the security of this hotel is alarming, we were appalled that anyone could just enter their level 3 pool area that is linked to the hotel in house restaurant Nizza and use all the amenities provided. Perhaps they are waiting for another YouTuber to make a video with all these 'free' access amenities that guests will have to pay a premium for.  Secondly, we had to wait almost an hour for just a bucket of ice to be delivered to our room, like other comments, the room service in this hotel deserves 1 star",1,-0.7894

You will always need a Taxi or just climb the hill...at 100F. Unfortunately after the stay all The problems started. Too incompetent to even charge you. Their bureaucracy even worse than in Brazil. They neither were able to credit my stay the correct way nor to credit me any point at all . Stay far away from this Sofitel. Won‚Äôt ever again stay at this Sofitel . A shame for the whole brand.

I cannot comment on the restaurants because we dined out at all of the great places to eat that surround the Hotel.   Linda who works at the check-in counter is probably the nicest woman that I have met during my 2 months spent in KL. Here attitude and customer service is what so many establishments in KL are lacking. Please give her a raise and a complimentary day at the Spa. She didn't ask me to say this!

"Just stayed 2 days in this beautiful hotel. Treatment at the lounge impeccable. Especially Anabela andFarhin were really accommodating ant helpful. Main problem is the location with hardly any access to public transportation. There is a metro but you have to climb up a hill. Not really an option. Okay for taxis etc. but maybe not suitable for longer stays. Huge construction going on in front. Hotel itself a gem, fabulous food, they take good care of you.  Housecleaning is efficient but missed making up the room after requesting it. They simply didn‚Äôt speak any of our languages.

"Stayed for 1 night twice in one month. I gotta say this is one of the best hotels ever. Room was spacious and comfortable with great view. Great breakfast. Room service wasn't expensive (I ordered the beef burger for around 30 Ringgit). They have a pool and a gym. Staff is super friendly and respectful and ALWAYS smiling, one of the best hotel staff I dealt with. I like that it is quite, when you're sleeping you don't hear anything. location was good for me, it took me 20 mins to get to important locations like the twin towers and prices for taxis isn't expensive (25 Ringgit to go to the twin towers). Within a walking distance you can find some shops, bars, restaurants, supermarket, and a grocery store.  Only negative for me was no smoking rooms.  Great experience 10/10",5,0.9911

However, that is where the disappointments begin. I was (as a platinum) upgraded to a junior suite that is really just a large room, so I am very glad I didn‚Äôt pay for the upgrade. I went to the restaurant on the ground floor just before 2100 and they have already cleared everything (surely not a good sign).  The service can be hit and miss.

I was really wrong about my assumptions and expectations. This Sofitel may look like a Sofitel, but it‚Äôs not up to worldwide 5 star Sofitel standards. Firstly, I would like to advice that the upgrade to the junior suite is not worth it, the only difference from a junior suite and a normal room is the size (it‚Äôs a corner room). It honestly looks the same as a normal room. And the view is not even a proper view, there are buildings pretty much blocking your view.

From the time we made the room booking with Cik Fizah (manager) till the day of check-out, their customer service levels were just ‚Äúoff the roof‚Äù!
