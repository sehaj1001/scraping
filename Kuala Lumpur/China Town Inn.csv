"I enjoyed my stay here.The location of this hotel is very good and is in the heart of the city. Staff and rooms are good and clean. It is located in the best shopping area, and all food stuff is available near by. It's the best choice for staying in Kula Lumpur. ",5,0.9674
"We encountered a lady and man receptionist during our 4 night stay. The lady was nice, no problem with the man either. Hotel is short walk away from pasar seni train station. Outside pasar seni is the free Go KL bus stop purple line. We tried to use a bus one day and they said no cash only card accepted. We didn’t have a card and a guy at tr bus station offered to sell it at 25 ringgit each. So we walked to the train instead. Central market is close to pasar seni. Pudu bus station and plaza raykat train station is also a Short walk away. If you are coming by long distance train, get off at Kuala Lumpur not KL Sentral and walk to hotel.  You need to take stairs to reach the hotel so beware if you have mobility issues. Hot and cold water dispenser on the same level as reception.",3,0
"We're touring Malaysia for 8 weeks &amp; this hotel met all our requirements. Good location, clean but basic. A little noisy from outside at night, so perhaps a room without a window would have been quieter. It was no frills, but no complaints from us either.",4,-0.7882
"It has a very convenient location close to many sights and only a 5 mins walk to airport bus stop. Room was small and a bit worn, but worth the price. Bathroom was weird with shower in the middle of it, so everything's wet there after using it. Good wifi. Nice personnel.",3,0.7684
"I stayed at this hotel with a friend for 3 nights and arrived late at night. The lady at the front desk was very friendly and asking for a key deposit of 60 MYR. She clearly said it will be fully redunded when we check out of the hotel. However once we left, a very old chinese man that seems to be the owner arrogantly and rudly refused to refund it in full. He reasoned the money we gave was the tax whereas we already paid full the room included tax. He was celarly the nightmare of our stay at the hotel. He is a very arrogant owner. Always being rude everytime talk to the people. I was just so impressed by the frindly ladies at the front desk and cleaners that kindly clean our room every day dueing our stay. The room/hotel itself is clean though and comfortable but NOT the way",3,0.7843
"The hotel room still using the old conventional single key to lock/unlock the room from inside/outside instead of computerized key-card system. There is a door latch for extra security.   Need to walk up the staircase to reached the lobby reception area at 1st floor and hotel has lift to go up level 2 to 5. A deposit of RM30 is require to get a room key and without issuing receipt for the deposit given.  A the glance the room and bathroom is clean but found some hairs on the floor next to the bed. Found a small cockroach wandering around the floor. Multiple clothes hanger provided. Have to wear jeans, thicker clothes &amp; socks during the sleep time  because the AC is centralized and unable to adjust the temperature.   The TV is super small (14inch) and a few channel to watch such",4,0.8462
"This hotell is perfect if you want to stay in a cheap place close to the city centre. Me and 2 friend, all grown males stayed in a 3 bed(1 single 1 double) and it was rather spacious. If you are planing to explore KL and only need a place to sleep and shower this is a good place for that. But do not expect something fancy. The surrounding china town is a must see if you like street vendors and bargaining.",4,0.9118
"I stayed there before it's marvellous in all respect staff is very good it's location is excellent. The most busy market , different variety of food and all type of convaince is available 24/7. It's a home abroad.",5,0.8748
Great location and foods are surrounding your area !! Room were huge but air conditioner is centralized with the hotel public area therefore we are unable to control the temperature . The price were cheap and value for money . Room were very very old like back in 90's with a little smells in the room. ,4,0.8989
"This is a budget hotel so don't expect much. Basic amenities provided. The good thing about it is the hotel's good location, near to bus and mrt/lrt stations, walking distance from central market and within petaling street market; lots of restaurant around the area. Safe to walk even on the wee hours of the morning. We arrived in the airport at 1am and reached the hotel at around 3am. From KLIA take bus to pudu station (RM12). Hotel is about 200m away.",4,0.8442
"The room is nice, basic and clean, no refrigerator or any other amenities, tv is an old tube style 13” but we didn’t care. The lobby is nice and clean and is fairly updated. The WiFi works good and is fairly strong with a few lapses here and there. The best part is the location, right outside the door is petaling street with a huge market bazar that really comes alive in the evenings. Lots of restaurants and hawker food stands everywhere, just 2 doors down is an excellent hawker stand where you can get chicken and rice for around $1.75 USD.   The only thing we did not like is the paper thin walls and room door, the flooring is laminated hardwood and the sound echoes from anywhere on your room floor. We had some very obnoxious Chinese travelers that stayed directly across from us",4,0.9879
"This place is actually a lot better than would think being in Chinatown. Good location. stairs only to reception on 2nd floor lifts to rooms from their.. very good english , good wifi connection. no breakfast included.",4,0.8746
"Good hotel with good price for those are travel around Chinatown area. Hotel is located inside the Chinatown. Easy to find any food you want and also near by LRT and MRT station. The hotel also very near to Central Market and Bukit Bintang, you may walking distance. Around Chinatown you may find a lot of minimarket 24hours, i love go to Family Mart causes may use credit card pay anything without minimum purchase. The hotel is very simple and not much i expected accordingly with the price. So far the hotel is good for Solo or Couple Traveller. I will come back again.",5,0.9538
"I wouldn't reccomend staying here if you want to enjoy your holiday. It would be okay as a backpacker I guess nut not for couples.  The room was dark and had no natural light. The sockets sounded dangerous and only worked when you fiddled around with the plug for 10 mins. The hot water completely stopped several times in the shower. During the evening small insects came through the drain. Even though we were on the 3rd floor. There was no hiding from the noise going on in the corridor; singing, people on their phones at all hours of the day.  We had laundry to do. We were told to take it to the other hotel, when it came back everything had shrank. The other guests were extremely rude some of them were pretty questionable and we think they were 'street workers' to put it",2,-0.379
"simple , easy to find . only malay receptionist very helpful. the rest of staff average rooms clean . big problem is the amount of steps it takes to get to reception. no good for disabled persons. in middle of chinatown",3,0.7713
"My arrival in kuala lumpur, i took a hotel in the middle of china town to familiarize myself with the places and if i can advise against a hotel it's this !  - very unpleasant staff (especially that of the reception) - no help (it looked like they were paid by the word close) - towels changed daily have a foul odor - smell and damp spots on all walls and ceilings - noise from morning to evening (screaming neighborhood in the corridors from room to room), you hear those on the other side as if they were 2 centimeters from you - no window - impossible to adjust the air conditioning and when I asked to change room I came across an air conditioning with plenty of tissues inside it to block yellow leaks - and to top it off, he has bed fleas (insects) so i left with spots on my face",1,-0.6105
"Last year I was here and this year, May 2018 I return again. I walked in and asked the staff if he could give me a good rate and I was given 55RM for a single queen size bed with air conditioning. I was extremely happy with this rate. I stayed here for 3 nights.  I was assigned room 502 and the room size was acceptable but with no windows. The water shower had a good pressure and the water temperature was good. It has a television with limited channels. If you need hot water, just go to main lobby and get it. The air conditioning on the second and third nights had a bit of problem because it will switched off automatically. The bed is comfortable. Needless to say the location is in the heart of Chinatown and the nearest train station is Pasar Seni. At night if you are hungry",4,0.7843
"I booked a double bed room with no windows,when we turned up they had a twin ready so we took that and pushed the beds together. I was travelling with my 4 and 6 year old daughters. The lady on reception was welcoming and friendly.   The room was clean and functional for sleeping in. The location is excellent, the kids and I enjoyed the walk through the market to get to the hotel entrance. The room was very quiet, no noise from the market.For the price I think great value, in Singapore we  later paid about 4 times as much for a room 1/3 the size. I think good all rounder for short stay in KL.   There is public transport very nearby in the way of a metro system which is very handy. Taxis are a bit of a pain in the rear, they won't take a fare unless it's a big one so expect to be",4,0.9638
"Never again. Booked an economy room for 11 USD per night, thinking I scored a deal. At the time of check-in, I was asked to pay an extra 10 ringgit per night, or to find another hotel. Manager claimed it was a tourist tax, but there was no mention of this""extras"" at the time of booking, and I've stayed in several hotels before this one, was never asked to pay such thing. Decided to pay the extra, since all I could think of was to shower and nap (should have walked away).  The whole 2nd floor smelled horribly, including the room.  My bed had bed bugs. Asked for a room change, but same deal.  The WiFi is unusable.  The area where the hotel is located is very dirty and noisy. You'll be harassed by the street vendors each time. Doesn't feel safe.  After check out, I asked if there",1,-0.9761
"We stayed there for one night but the staff in the reception is very welcoming and nice. We got a good room, although no windows, but the price is excellent for that. Really good beds and shower. Location is just in Chinatown market but you don’t get the noisy from outside. So it’s worth staying here.",5,0.9685
"China Town Inn has something for every (semi-)budget traveller. Basic rooms without windows but with bathroom for around 60MYR and rooms with windows for a bit more. Some bathrooms seem to have recently been renovated. The last stay we got a room facing Petaling street. The isolation of the windows is inexistent but the room was spacious, had a TV and curtains to make the night cosy and dark. You got a great view on the busy street vendors. The bathroom was ok the sheets could be renewed but were clean. In any case I would recommend this place as you get good value for money. If you want to pay 30-50MYR more you of course get a nicer room in Amigo Hotel or Hotel 99 just 2 mins away. China Town Inn stays my choice.",4,0.9731
"My husband and I have been coming to this hotel for the last 25 years. We have always found the people at the service desk informative, polite and helpful. For a budget hotel, the rooms are exceptionally clean. It is easy to get to and the taxi service to the airport is punctual.We would highly recommend this budget hotel to anyone and will stay there again when we are in KL. Revi &amp; Deirdre, Perth",5,0.8882
"The only good thing about this hotel is the location, in the middle of China town, few minutes from the central market, 5 min. from the central train station, 15-20 minutes walking to the food street (Jalan Alor). Staff are ok, not super friendly, rooms are below average (the ones I got had no windows.",2,-0.4356
Location: Perfect Facilities: Very good Staff: Acceptable Price: very good  Perfect spot if you want to visit Kuala Lumpur for few days or a couple of weeks either alone or with family. I got a single room for 14USD with AC (little bit noise but it kept the room always pleasant).   ,4,0.8087
"I normally travel through hostels and dorms but landing in a new city I decided to go with the hotel as an upgrade. Great location and clean with good facilities, my only negative is that the room I was in was a smoking room so had a strong odour to it, they tried to air freshen the room for me, but I would reccomend to those staying in the area",4,0.9309
In the heart of very busy china town clean rooms good wifi good price  but watch out for the government add ons  tourist tax do they want us too come here !!!  Ten ringits per night and local tax 7 percent  spot put 38 ringits on my bill and if I did not like it leave ,4,0.5622
The hotel is in the best location and directly in China town. The staff is so unfriendly. There's a 24 hour reception which is helpful. The room stinks is small and has no window. The blanket wasn't clean. ,3,-0.1777
"I arrived in the morning to check into the hotel (my paperwork said that it was available from 07:00) to be told to come back by some grumpy bloke on the front counter.....check in after 2, check in after 2 as he pointed at the sign.  I get that check is normally after 2, as it is most places in the world. It was the way i was told!  So I come back at 14:45, got my key (great I thought finally I can have a shower and relax).   Got into the room to find that it hadn't been cleaned. Now I don't know what animal lived in there, but lets say it stunk of rotten bananas. The bin was overflowing and heaved in a pile about 2 feet.  I go down and say to the lovely girl (who was very pleasant on my arrival) that the room isn't clean. The grumpy man asked if I could wait another 15",1,0.1642
"The best thing about the hotel is its location ! Its in the heart of the busy Chinatown of Kuala Lumpur. you  wont have to go anywhere to have a sumptuous dinner or to buy things from famous hawkers market of Chinatown.  So many eateries here and there around the place. They are open till midnight ! People all over the world roam around buy things having their cup of tea or dinner ! The place so busy with life. Now, about the hotel, Hotel is very clean no doubt, they change bed linen everyday. Cleaning staff are very good. They provide drinking water for free. You get wifi service moderately good. Reception lounge in spacious and you can spend few hours sitting in couch placed there, well decorated place no doubt.  Bad thing about the hotel is that most of the rooms are without",3,0.7827
"Location is good for the Market however, the room is very basic and worn, it was quite expensive for what it was but we only stayed for a couple of nights so it was fine. Room cleaned everyday by staff with fresh towels etc but seemed like more of a hostel than a hotel in terms of the standard. ",3,0.8407
"We stayed here with our family and really loved it, clean ,friendly staff and very central . Would definitely stay again . We use to stay at a hotel up the road ( swiss ) but this is half the price cleaner newer and much more friendly staff . Thanks ",5,0.9535
"Traveling for many moons thro out Asia this was far the BEST room for our budget in Malaysia  Spot less rooms , great receptionist s answered all our needs  Room cleaned every day by wonderful cleaning staff  Wi-Fi good  Best shower we have experienced in all of  Asia  All private bathrooms which can be difficult to find in Malaysia  Very comfy beds  Very quiet considering your in the middle of Chinatown  Location few minutes from train station and the bus station very close only 12 ringets to airport  Can't speak night enough of this hotel ",5,0.9587
"Thr hotel is well located for those coming from the airport by shuttle bus. But with almost no dining options around, you have to walk. Exactly on Petaling Street, so to find the hotel, make sure you walk behind the stalls. For one or two nights it is ok. All rooms and bathrooms are tooo tiny and very basic with no amenities. That's what you got in KL for cheap prices. The hotel also offers nothing besides lift and wifi, very basic. For booking with low rates, I suggest contacting the hotel, asking for a discount code and booking directly on their website. Card payments require an extra fee.",3,0.1744
"Got a Superior Triple room - a queen and a single for about S$34 per night. Expect only the bare necessities - bed, v small tv, small toilet with shower, no windows (no noise from night market) and wifi. Centralised air-con - pretty cold for my room on the 4th floor.   Day and night market right at doorstep. Day market starts as early as about 8am and the road is closed when the night vendors roll in. Expect lots of imitation products (sports shoes, sportswear, etc). Do bargain.   Food stalls just right around the corner. Most noodles / porridge cost about RM$5-10. Supermarket nearby as well.  ",4,0.8126
Stay at this hotel for 5 nights with my wife..the reception staff (i think all 4 person)is very friendly and helpfully. What i really like about this hotel is their cleanlines where its hard to find in other hotel around KL chinatown..even the toilet and bathroom is very clean..kudos to their housekeeping staff.  Only you cant control airconditioner tempreture because its automatically centralised system..so in certain nights u will feel very cold.,4,0.8898
"My husband and I spent a night here after their sister hotel overbooked and could not give us a room. It has a great location in Chinatown, which is the primary reason to stay here. The rooms are windowless, beds are reasonably comfortable, water is hot. There is a cooler with water in the lobby. Room is reasonably clean and our neighbors were quiet, at least on the night we were there.  It's a cheap place to stay in a great location. But remember: you're staying for the location, and not much else.",3,0.936
"Pros: good position, helpful staff, rooms and beds clean, central aircon, fair price. Cons: peaceful sleep depends on neighbors, wifi free but very unreliable (in Room 102 at least). Have been coming here for five years, more out of habit than anything else.",3,0.8225
"This hotel is a decent budget hotel. Everything is ok but the aircond and toileteries. They provided only soap and shampoo. i think they should provide body shampoo instead. The aircond is a centralized aircond, so you can't adjust the temperature and fan speed of the aircond. Hair dryer is only available at the reception counter. No lift from Ground floor (main entrance) to 1st floor (Reception counter). One staff is not friendly. When i was asking for Water Dispenser, He kept pointing only, didn't even try to explain nicely. Overall is just ok.",3,0.607
"Pros:  Amazing location within Chinatown - wifi - price  Cons:  You can hear EVERYTHING that happens in rooms surrounding you. Even to the extent that you can hear what happens in the bathroom   If you have luggage it is a struggle going through the centre of Chinatown, squeezing past all the narrow stalls in order to get to the hotel. Then you must climb the stairs",3,0.3612
"The rate is not expensive but not  cheaper than others, room is clean with bathroom inside, receptionists can speak Bahasa, TV &amp; Wifi, are available, free dispenser water without breakfast,located in Petaling Street",4,0.8402
"+ The hotel Is in at good location and close to many attractions and restaurants.   - Mold every where at the room so nasty to sleep in and it smells.  Very noisy, the walls are paper thin.  . . .  . .  . . . . . .  ",1,-0.2286
"We spent 3 days in this hotel, deluxe room, on April 2017. Except the noisy air-conditioner in room 507, everthing is good. This is heart of China town. It is 5 minutes walking to the Pasar Seni station. From Pasar Seni, you can take an LTR to KL Sentral for just 1.3RM/ticket. You can also go around KL by purple free-bus named GoKL at Pasar Seni or call a grab/uber from the hotel.",3,0.296
"The receptionist initially told us they had both fan and aircon rooms available as either twin or double rooms. When we realised he'd given us keys to only the 'twin' rooms, we returned to the reception desk to request keys to the 'double' rooms: 'Oh, sorry, those rooms aren't available, we only have twin rooms available at the moment.' If I had a dollar for every time we were given this line at a SEA guesthouse...  Yes I get that this is a predominately Muslim country, and same-sex relations are technically illegal; but when organised prostitution of predominantly transgendered workers is occurring right outside the cheap hotels in these areas, refusing to offer a one-bed room to a couple of women seems a little beyond the pale. Besides which, there are so many local queer men",1,-0.5423
"Good price, excellent location, clean, comfy beds, very fast wifi internet. If you only need to sleep and have a good jumping off point is a great place. Really close to the Sentral Station, 30 minutes walk to the Petronas Twin Towers, 15 minutes walk to beautiful park .",4,0.9648
"Location is slightly tough to find in a location behind the numerous stalls in Petaling Street &amp; slightly dangerous returning back during late nights(too many dark &amp; blind spots &amp; light r all switched in Petaling Street at night)..  Otherwise staff service, room conditions &amp; everything is graded at 8/10 based on its pricing category &amp; location.. based on Deluxe Queen Room(with window).. they have satelite tv channels to entertajn u if feel like relaxing in your rooms..  i won't know abt other room categories..",4,-0.0036
"We check in on Christmas eve, the lady receptionist was impatient, irritable and 100% not friendly. Maybe Santa haven't send her what she wish for  : ( Not going back unless there are no more room available in the whole city.",2,-0.7527
"It's right off the main strip of Chinatown on petaling street, but our room had no window so you couldn't hear a sound.  The rooms are pretty small, just a few feet between the bed and walls to move around but not a problem. Bed was comfy with good quilt. Good shower with hot and cold water. Aircon worked well, and wifi wasn't too bad either.  You're in Chinatown so location is pretty much ideal - you can get Uber or grab anywhere very cheap, or walk. We walked to the petronas Towers one day, and it only takes about half an hour / 40 mins.  Staff friendly, they also have computers to use downstairs for a small cost. Coming back to KL I would stay again if on budget.  If you like Roti Canai there is a place on the left as you leave petaling st onto the main road - delicious.",4,0.9916
"This used to be my regular hotel in KL but had a really poor stay this time. Firstly , the aircon isn't even cold.. since it's centralised aircon, was told by staff that it will get colder by night time but it didn't. To make things worse, at 5.45am in the morning, got a rude awakening from my sleep by incessant loud noise just above my room, somewhat like some construction or malfunction equipment..told the staff and it lasted for almost 15mins before I can sleep again! Shampoo has changed a packet type and isn't enough for a day. There are many other hotels at similar price range nowadays, this property is old and though the TVs have just been upgraded to LCDs of late, it is going to lose out in business if no improvements are made. When I check out, the manager is showing his",1,-0.9395
"Located in the heart of chinatown, easy to shop and eat. Near to train station and you can go like every where.. :) The hotel quite old, but the room is clean. The staffs are very helpful.  We checked out very early in the morning, and the staff booked us a taxi at the night before. ",4,0.9079
This hotel is so central to Chinatown. It was also friendly with a helpful staff. It was clean and comfortable with large windows looking down on all the activity. There were lots of restaurants and cheap shopping for everything as well as a family bundle thrift shop. Fabulous!,4,0.9501
"i stayed here for 3 night and it was good stay ..  It is very nice  budget  hotel placed in good locality (China town -one of the best shopping place ) and very accessible to bus station and train .(Parser seni and Padu station).  Hotel is having all basic facilities like wifi, hot water ,cleaned room  ..etc and staffs are nice people.  Many indian hotel are near by  in 500ms distance",5,0.9564
"China Town Inn is an established budget hotel. It is located right in the Chinatown. It is a great location to me as this affordable hotel is close enough to the following landmarks such as Petaling Street, Central Market, Pudu Sentral Bus terminal, Berjaya Times Square, KLCC and etc. The best part is I can check in before 12pm, and as usual the check-out time is around 12pm. There are lot of facilities here including Wifi, baggage storage, housekeeping &amp; 24 hour registration. However, no parking &amp; pet available. The room is value for money but common things like kettle, mugs, tea &amp; breakfast are not provided.",4,0.8176
"We had a room with street view, which was incredibly noisy. Half of the time we didn't have internet connection, but the staff fixed it every time we asked (a problem with the router). The location is pretty good, in the heart of Chinatown. Don't expect too much of the room, you get what you pay for, but it's fine for a few nights.",3,0.6911
"Stayed here for one night as a stop over. It is right in the centre of petaling street which is why we picked it, but it was a bad decision. In our room, the 'headboard' area of the wall was completely smashed in so we had to sleep on the other side of the bed. The floor was dirty and there were ants, despite being on the fourth or fifth floor! In the middle of the night we were woken up by someone being sick in the next room and people loudly walking past our room. The front of the room, facing the corridor, had a large window, for some reason, which could be opened and didn't seem particularly safe for our things. Yet on the side facing outdoors, a tiny window at the top that couldn't be opened. Only plus to this hotel was working air con and nice staff.",1,-0.9257
"I have been here for a night with my wife n baby.. had a best stay, very quite even the city is very busy and noisy. I booked this hotel without paying anything. Guys are very friendly. Highly recommend this place!!",5,0.8852
"This place is right in the heart of Petaling Street, you cannot drive right up, walking is required for a short distance.  It is close or walking distance to a lot of things, and if not the cabs are cheap.  I went for a cheap one person room and maybe should have splurged on the a/c as the fan was sufficient but a/c would have been preferred.  However it was clean and the staff was helpful and friendly.  Wifi is good in the room.",4,0.952
Close to everything. Right in the heart of China town street market. Close to mono rail and buses. Rooms comfortable enough although a little worn out but at such a cheap price and being so close to the centre its worth it,4,0.4672
"OK, this place isn't the Hilton but for the price, it is very competitive! We paid about 85MYR per night, and that was for an air con room with no window; something we were apprehensive of at first, but it was actually great! No hotel here will have a great view (unless you are paying ££) so no loss there, also no bugs and no waking up due to sunlight...!   The rooms were fairly basic but again to be expected.. comfortable bed, TV, air con worked fine as did the wifi.  As you walk outside, you are right in the thick of Chinatown - this can make finding the hotel a bit difficult if you arrive at night. Otherwise, all good!",4,0.8691
"What I love from this hotel: - great location (central location within KL, close to tourist place which is there is market right outside) - great price - nice bed, towel, and toilet  what I think as minus from this hotel: - noisy air conditioner - not so friendly staff",3,0.9041
"Good points: Location, Bed and Towel. Price.  Needs Improvement: 1/2 of the Staff. Toilet.  Central location within KL and close to tourist places. My only concern is )and partly because of our fault, being unable to research) when we ask the staff at the lobby of options going to the airport. Instead of answering, they did a little trick in marketing their transport car service. Also, misinformation since buses are available 5 hrs before the time of our flight. Staff said the bus won't be accessible that time. This is a first we traveled not having enough knowledge because this is more of a spontaneous decision.  Pretty nice small rooms and not-bad-toilet. Just have to work on the toilet and cleaning of the toilet too. Some rooms are juxtaposed each other so good luck if you've",2,0.9339
"It was a very fun environment with the market right outside. China town is alway bumping, very beautiful at night. The aircon worked great. Nice bar right round the corner. We never felt unsafe while we were there. 2 min walk from the train station. Easy to get around",4,0.9558
"This place, situated on Petaling plexiglass roofed street right in the very heart of Chinatown Kuala Lumpur, is an absolutely clean place, like all chinese places we have stayed in SE Asia, for the past 9 years now.They will change you bedshits and clean your room every day! All rooms are a/c, half of them with a view to Petaling Str., wifi in the room, price 25 USD for the double room with private bathroom. The staff is almost friendly and Petaling str. is an experience. We have stayed there 4 or 5 times, that is every time we are in KL, from 5 to 18 days max. Never had a problem, but mind you, if you have a room from Petaling side, it is noisy and very interesting on a 24 h basis, as the use of this street is changing all the time! Amazing! We are happy customers and of course",5,0.9703
"We stayed at both hotels, seeing as this was the first, we thought it might be better, but the only thing was their snazzy touch pads in the lifts rather than buttons. Personally i would stay at the (2) hotel.  Reception was a nice size with a few deposit boxes, and a TV showing films.   After checking in, instead of giving us a standard twin, they gave us a double which was not what we wanted. I'm not sure why they can't read the booking details properly. So as soon as we swung the door open, we were already on our way back to reception.   The room we eventually stayed in was small, and had a tiny window smaller than a bathroom window, but you could catch a glimpse of the street below and petronas which was cool.   Staff helped us arrange a taxi very early in the morning and at",3,0.8503
"We stayed here for 3 nights after a week in a very budget chalet in the Perhentians. The staff were very friendly and helpful, the room was spotless and the bed very comfortable. We stayed in a double room with ensuite. There is free wifi, which works throughout the hotel. It was pretty cheap in my opinion for what we got - great value for money! Chinatown is a lovely lively and central part of KL with lots of shopping and restaurants and good transport links. Overall a lovely stay in KL :)",4,0.9905
"I went to visit a friend who was staying there, on a stopover before she went to PENANG.  Hotel room was small,  budget, but the double bed was firm. Room 302 had no windows, but air conditioning worked. Bathroom was good. Other room furnishings acceptable. Furnishing was basic, but had a place to place the luggage.

"The room &amp; staff was Good. They provide Free hot &amp; cold drinking water near the reception. WIFI was good too in my room at 4th floor.  Plenty of restaurant &amp; shops nearby.   The reception was located at the first floor above. Do take note if you have a Big luggage. From the reception, there've a Lift access to the room",4,0.8442
"Stayed in a small damp room with a fan, no window but comfortable bed, good wifi and a film channel in English! Located in the heart of China Town so a good location. for the price it was fine - watch out for the tax add-ons when paying the bill!!!",3,0.9483
"This hotel is clean, but unfortunately you can hear absolutely everything through the doors and windows. After a 12 hour flight, my neighbour didn't allow me to sleep very much. Didn't help with the jet lag. The room had no window, which is unfortuante as it would good to see the city, when resting from the heat and busiest of KL. I was booked for 2 nights but left after 1.",2,-0.8216
Very Cozy place. Got lots of Tourust coming down here as here got biggest street market in whole kuala lumpur. and its famous for the name Chinatown. I have stayed here for 3 days and they got really nice room with and room are quite good and clean and i had really great time staying there.. I was there with one of my friend. Staff are quite friendly. i would recommend to go and stay there next time.. :),4,0.9779
"Only 15 USD 1 night good location, but  restaurant is not available Around the hotel , The one lacking is that some rooms don't have Air conditioning system. Hotel staff also good  and helpful , Taxi booking is also available",3,0.8591
"Anyone who wanted to stay in KL i would recommend Hotel China Town Inn, nice staff, good room service, clean hotel. Walking distance to basically everywhere. Good bargaining shopping in china town.  I had change my dates due changes in the flights they did it without any additional charges. We had a wonderful holiday stay in KL. From the hotel once you walk down the street you get ""Go KL "" purlple line bus which is free, you can go to Bukit bintag, if you want to go to klcc you have to get green line bus from bukit bintang.   Indian, chinese, bangali restaurants all around the hotel. Street food is one of the major attraction for food lovers.   If you are thinking for a buget, low cost, clean, friendly, safe hotel then you should go Hotel China Town Inn",5,0.9888
"Well, where should I start off? We arrived very late. The first thing I noticed was that my bed sheet wasn't changed. It was so sandy, so I asked the guy at the reception if he could changed it. He said: no you should change it by yourself. Since I didn't want to have a big discussion I changed it by myself, which was not what I had to do. He had to do it that's why I pay the hotel for. Furthermore we found cockroaches in our room. We told that the Chinese guy at the desk but he didn't care. In addition to that, the other guy was very unfriendly to my boyfriend when he asked him what we could do in KL.  I wouldn't recommend this hotel at all. This hotel should rethink their customer service that they (don't) offer their guests. It's not a clean hotel at all.",1,-0.9193
"I stayed here for 2 weeks this month and loved it. Staff, especially Sisi, Raj and Jason were brilliant, my deepest thanks to them. Comfy bed, no cable tv in my room but very good wifi. Terrific location and whilst no resto here 1000's of cheap eateries in China Town. Comfy bed, have stayed here before and will again.",2,0.9049

"After having backpacked Asia for several weeks this was my second last stop and definitely did not disappoint.  Room was small but clean, the location was great, Chinatown markets right out the front door and a short walk to bus stop and western eateries.  The male employee that was on duty at the time, Raj, was one the friendliest and most helpful person I met on my whole trip, due to a stupid mistake I had left my camera on the bus that I had arrived on and thanks to him calling the bus line and finding out where the bus was, speaking to the driver and then after finishing his shift accompanying me for almost 2.5hrs to the bus depot and return, i was able to get my camera back.  Now that can only be called service above and beyond what is expected.  Thanks Raj, if I am every",5,0.9602
"Pros: Cheap and Clean. Good Wifi. Very near to Puduraya bus stop. Metro is at walkable distance.  Cons: The area was very crowded, inside Chinatown. TV was very old and small, we didn't use that.  Our overall stay was good as we used it as transit. It allows early checkin. Easy to reach hotel by public transort.",3,0.8519
"I stayed here for a day, as I wanted to be in the heart of Kuala Lumpur, with close access to the city's shopping &amp; places of interest. Had booked a standard room, which (to my surprise,) had just a table fan (instead of a ceiling fan!)  The room was clean &amp; well maintained. Ditto for the bathroom. Paid MYR 60 for a night, which I feel was absolutely reasonable, (except for the table fan.) The only downside was that the hotel is on the 1st floor, for which you need to climb a few stairs. From thereon lift access is available.  The staff was pretty helpful, providing you all the necessary guidance and assistance. Had a very pleasant experience on the whole and a wonderful stay. But, please avoid the standard room if you can pay a little more.",4,0.9656
"It's ok here for people on a budget, basic rooms, got what you need, it would be better if the staff actually spoke to you, didn't get a thank you for staying or said anything to us once we checked out or even much when we checked in. When coming back to kuala lumper from Penang, as we needed to stay another night in Kuala Lumper to fly to our next destination, we decided to stay just a few doors down to a much better place for a slightly Cheaper Price with friendly staff. It's also not great for meeting people but it's fine for an overnight stay. ",3,0.6246
"This hotel is located right inside the china town with easy access to the metro.  The rooms were good but the Fan room only had one table fan and it was quite hot in the night.  The hotel staff was quite unfriendly to offer Free WiFi passwords, water and everything was self service.  Considering the price to the location, it was a good option to stay.",3,0.9247
Location is very good within walking distance to the most places of interest and a couple of metro stations. Staff is friendly and very helpful with organizing even small errands. International cable TV wich was useful on a rainy day.  Really loud due to the Chinese market. The merchants start to yell and bang at 5 in the morning. Ants in the room.,3,0.9366
We stayed here for three nights. It takes some finding as it's right in the heart of the China town market (you have to walk the last stretch) but it was a good location. The hotel controls the air conditioning in the rooms but it was a perfect temperature throughout our stay. It's good value for money if you're looking for somewhere just to sleep. ,4,0.9505
We have stayed here for one week. There were no complains and it was a comfortable stay. The location is right in the middle of China Town. Easy access for restaurants &amp; supermarkets. Helpful reception staff named Raj who gave us useful information about tourist attractions. Internet and printing also available at the lobby area for reasonable price. Great Place....,5,0.9337
"This place is in the busiest street in China Town.  At night, it's very crowded. If you're not into that, you may want to get a hotel in another location.  I liked the hustle and bustle.  I got a room with no window, so noise from the street was not a problem.  I did however end up in a room very close to reception, so I could hear conversations coming from there.  If you need a quiet room, request one that's not on the floor where reception is.  This hotel has central air conditioning. You won't be able to set your own temperature.  I found the temperature to be good, so that wasn't an issue.   Room was clean, bed was comfy, and WIFI was sufficient.",4,0.8298
"We stayed here for just one night, and I have almost no complaints, there is the lack of windows, which is obviously weird, and there were a group of loud Chinese people outside our room whose mission it seemed to be to prevent all sleep and fill our room with smoke (they were smoking). That said, it's in an awesome location, the road it's situated on is full of stalls and hawker food in the evening. It's also just a short walk from the bus station and a train station. The trains are incredibly cheap and efficient so try and use them as much as you can. The staff were very helpful in giving us directions and the like, and the reception/lounge area made quite a cool change to the reception standard in most hotels. In the one day we had in KL we felt we pretty much covered it. The",4,0.9323

The room was spacious, clean and had the comfiest bed!!! The ac was set to a perfect temperature for us, and is controlled by the hotel so that was lucky!! However I had booked the economy room online and having realised was only a room with fan emailed to upgrade to ac. I got a reply saying that was ok with new price 10rm more than booking price. When we arrived at hotel they tried to say the room They had upgraded me too was unavailable and I had to pay around 30rm more on top for the next room available. They eventually gave me the ac room at their price they had emailed me. So not sure if they were just trying to",4,0.9274
"We stayed here for 2 nights on our visit to Kuala Lumpur. The hotel is located in the middle of Petaling Street, which is a nice and buzzy street near all sights.

The staff was also  nice and friendly.",3,0.9536
"I have stayed at Hotel China town in of 2 separate occasions and enjoyed myself both times. The hotel is in a great location, wifi works fine and has free hot/cold filtered water in the lobby.   First stay 3 nights. Room 301 (I think) 106MR per night. Big room with window overlooking the markets. Great room, air con unit was a bit old it didn't work the best but better then nothing, noise from the markets goes until around 11pm/12am depending on what day it is. It didn't bother us but if you like to sleep early it might be a bit noisy. Wifi works in room.  Second stay 4 nights. We opted for a cheaper room this time. Room 506, 85MR per night. Small room, no window, much newer more efficient air conditioner. Wifi works in room (I skyped my family) but the connection is definitely",4,0.9646
"We stayed in twin room 305 and paid 106 MYR. The beds can easily be moved, to make one large bed. Spacious and clean room with table space enough for 2 backpacks and more. Windows can be opened! No dampness or bad smell! There is no breakfast, but to place oneself in the much smaller and damp rooms at Lantern just to get a breakfast on a nice terrace doesn't seem rational to me, it is like paying money to willingly place oneself in some discomfort (except for the wonderful breakfast location).  Both these hotels are in the middle of Chinatown, and on the famous shopping street. The only negative was a bit of noise outside before midnight when the street vendors disassemble their stands.",5,0.4468
"All that basic things that we needed at an affordable price. Clean room, comfortable bed, Hot shower, TV with cable, accomodating front desk, free wifi, computer rental with printing services, accessible to good bargains and tourist spots. Got good tips from the receptionist. The only cons is the sound proofing of the room (conversations from the adjacent rooms and hallway can be heard)",4,0.9337
"the service-staffs are friendly and kindly at providing information. rooms are very clean and tidy everyday with fresh towels and change bed-sheets, also soap and shampoo top-up daily. The economy fan rooms are not air-conditioned and much cheaper compared to the others which are all air-conditioned rooms. Location is fantastic with all transport stations nearby just walking distance ..food also easy with many restaurants surrounding chinatown available till late night. Actually nothing to complain and all to praise this hotel for the fantastic stay.. just love it for the good rates we pay.",5,0.9877
"Great location - right in the middle of Chinatown! Loved it! Very clean. Basic but had all I needed - a bed, a bathroom and a tv! Yes, I spent a lot of time out of the room but at night it's nice to relax while watching HBO! I got the room with AC and was glad I did - it's so hot in Malaysia! The room was hot but the AC kicked in fast and thank goodness they had a fan in the room bc that helps! Bring your own shampoo, conditioner and soap as there is none. Everything is clean and nice. I was happy - especially with the staff; they are very nice and helpful! Taxi service to the airport is offered at a great price! I would stay here again - it's within walking distance to Central Market and  the bus station.",5,0.9965

"We booked a room here good for 4 persons, it is along Petaling Street, it is recommended for those who like to shop and buy ""pasalubong"" because  the street is a night market right in front of the hotel doorstep. However, rooms are small and there's not much space to put your luggage. There's a free drinking water located in the hotel lobby so there's no need  to buy one, just refill your bottle how many times you want. Staffs are just ok, not that friendly but will answer all your questions in a polite manner. Will i go back to this hotel? yes if i want to save and on a tight budget.",3,0.9152
"The hotel is located in the heart of Chinatown (Petaling street). It is a positive point for people like me who like crowded areas with lots of shops, bars and restaurant. You can walk to Pasar Seni LRT station. It won't take longer than 5 minutes. The rooms are clean and towels and other bath amenities are changed every day. Breakfast is not served and most of the rooms have no window. By the way, during our stay in this hotel, elevator was out of service and it was really disappointing! ;-(",3,0.7095
"We stayed here for 9 nights and got a room with a window. This is a budget hotel in an amazing spot in China town. We loved the hustle and bustle of the markets each day - there is something electric about this area, even though some locals have bemoaned the fact that the original Chinese people &amp; families have gone!  The hotel is budget and dated! But very clean and well kept and the staff are really friendly and helpful. The rooms are cleaned daily. Our bed was comfortable and the air conditioning lovely and cold when you need it. We were working and they gave us a comfy chair to use with the desk in our room.  Our Wifi was variable - some days I was able to run a data hungry webinar with live video streaming - some days it was harder to get on. If you want a good connection,",4,0.9859
Rooms can be so small here you may have problems where to put your bag as well as yourself -especially if it is a single but my double room was no better.  Watch out for the steep steps of stairs as you entrance. Best not bother if you have a problem with your knees. Located Close inside the street/alley which comes alive mostly early evening currency exchange right near here but I did not use them as I prefer to go to a local bank in the  daytime which is safer.,3,0.9281
"I really did enjoy my stay here!   I arrived at the hotel at about 9am having just got off a long overnight train ride from Singapore.  As the market wasn't really out then, it was easy enough to find.   There is a big sign if you look up over the market stalls and onto the surrounding buildings.  Check in was swift and the staff were polite.  You can get a key for a free safety deposit box which is located in reception.     Room was on the 5th floor, at the back of the hotel (side without the market below) and I had a great view on KL out of the window.   Room was spacious and clean and the bathroom was adequate.  Hotel is located in the middle of China Town so the location is amazing, you can walk to pretty much anywhere.  The only place we took a taxi to was the Petronas",4,0.9822
"The hotel is very difficult to find, when arrived at night and all the markets were set up, it was very busy and spent around half an hour trying to find the place!  At first the receptionist was unfriendly because we had booked and paid for our room through hostelworld however the lady said we had to pay again and we would be refunded from hostelworld within 7 days! This wasnt good for us as we were short on money.  The rooms were nice, we had aircon so it was nice and cool.  The location itself it great, Chinatown is right on your doorstep with lots of places to eat and explore. The rail station is also a short walk away so its easy to get around to see all the attractions.  Just watch out for the scammers! They do try and rip you off and sell you fake brands, we nearly bought",4,0.8251
"At first found it very difficult to find the place, since chinatown itself is very colourful and has a lot of accommodation places, check in was quick (you pay 30 ringgit for key deposit). we had the cheapest room without a window. Was a bit too hot without an air con, but fan helps you cool the room down a bit. You can get drinking water downstairs and they have daily maid services. I thought the hotel had a good location, nice and quiet and good free WIFI! Would stay again!",4,0.9767
"Located in the heart of Chinatown. Best value for money within the stretch. Depending on your choice of with or without window room, rooms are spacious and clean. Wifi is abit slow but reliable. Basic needs like hot / cold beverage can be purchased within the hotel. Absolutely recommended for travellers travelling as a family, solo or with friends.",4,0.9348
"We stayed only one night in no-window  standard room and cannot give much review because we arrived late in the evening and left the next morning. The location is great in the middle of Chinatown with food stalls and souvenir shops around. Overall, we had a pleasant stay. The room was painted green, had a central air conditioning (no remote control to adjust the temperature), The water dispenser was outside the room in common area. Wifi was free and quite fast. Very recommended for budget traveler.",4,0.9195
We stayed here while backpacking around Asia. The hotel was fairly difficult to find as it is right in the middle of Chinatown but the stall owners all know where to direct you. We had a room without a window which didn't really matter as we spent most of the time out in KL. The hotel was clean with an ok shower and bed. Would definitely recommend staying here for a great location and brilliant atmosphere as soon as you walk out of the hotel door!,4,0.9716
"We stayed here on three different visits and each time we had a different room. We had a top floor first as it was a top tip , and yes its not so noisy. As the other two rooms that we stayed in was quiet loud as you are right over the market.  As  all the rooms go they are very clean and comfortable . All the staff are very helpful and such a great location you are right in china town.",5,0.9636
"We stayed 2nights in a standard twin for £10 a night (cheap by KL standards)  No window in the room but actually this was probably a blessing as it meant no noise from the market down below and a really good sleep. Hot shower with great water pressure, clean room and comfortable bed's.  Meets most backpackers needs as far as room's go with the added bonus of having multiple hooks and hangers to put clothes on(after 3months travelling I can count on one hand the budget places that have even 1 hook!) Central location, took us half an hour to walk to Patronas towers, and plenty of cheap eats round about ",4,0.9824

"This budget hotel is clean, well maintained and centrally located in Kuala Lumpur's Chinatown.  The staff was quite helpful arranging bus and taxi transportation, a real plus since KL is the center hub for much of travel in Peninsular Malaysia. In a month's Malaysian holiday, we stayed here a nite or 2 on 4 occasions. The staff's  assistance played a key part in our successfully getting to the next site and even in coming up with a Plan-B when the buses going where we initially planned to go were full.    All rooms have a hot shower and an adequate A/C. Room, bedding and towels were cleaned/changed daily and there is free (slow) WiFi.  In addition to having a window, deluxe rooms are significantly larger .   Plenty of close-by restaurants and stalls should be able to satisfy",4,0.9698
"We truly enjoyed the china town experience right outside our door. Awesome to check out. The hotel was good in most regards. We cheaped  out and got the room without the window, I wouldn't recommend you do the same. You never realize how much you miss the window till it's gone.  They even cleaned our room which surprised us as we had left valuables out, but everything was arranged in a neat pile on the freshly made bed. Would definitely stay here again, just with a window!",4,0.9441
"Me and my family stayed in this hotel during our stay in kuala Lumpur. and i must say we all loved staying there. specially my parents and in - laws were very happy with the cleanliness, friendliness of staff and hospitality.  also we reached there 7am in morning but hotel management was kind enough to give us early checkin.  No luxury but clean, comfortable and centrally located.  this place is very strategically located with surrounded by local market. For vegetarian public, there are lots of fruit vendors right outside hotel and serves quality fruits.",5,0.9513
"As chinatown funs around the world, we usually take the chance of staying in chinatowns, thus the present hotel. We have stayed in this hotel 2 years back, again on February, which means ""gonk si fa tsai"" for the chinese, ""happy new year"" in mandarin, if I am not mistaken. The hotel situated in the center of Jalan Petaling of chinatown KL, is in the very middle of a lot of happening therefore. Some of it, like dragon parades, we watch it from our windows upstairs. The place is well runned by chinese of course, who know how to maintain customers and make money. Wifi in room, a/c too cold, centrally operated, personel distant, proffessional like (except the cleaning ladies, the only ones who smile). 100 malaysian riggit/night, that is 25 euros, it is not a cheap option. But then,",3,0.9171
"We are budget travelers and stayed three nights here.   PROS - The location is really fun, right on the strip in Chinatown. Very lively with lots of great food nearby.  - We had a twin bed room with no window, and found it comfortable and clean. It wasn't huge but was bigger than other places we've stayed in this price range.  - The shower was great, hot and with good pressure. - The wifi was a little temperamental, but reached the room and worked well enough.   CONS - While we never heard any of the street commotion, if you happen to get clueless neighbors you can hear what goes on inside the hotel. One night a couple of guys talked for what seemed like hours. The other two nights we didn't hear a peep. Just depends.  - Typical SEAsian shower where the whole bathroom gets wet.",4,0.9546
"The rooms have all the basics - a bathroom, clean sheet, a desk, a tv, hot water and a working (though not controllable) a/c.  We as a family have issues with eastern breakfast so we carry ours with us and lack of minibars in the room was a minus for us.  The hotel has great location, its in the middle of Petaling Street and has easy access to public transportation.  Staff is very friendly, they kindly answered all our questions. Our basic needs were met almost immediately. So when you come here do not expect any luxury. But its a budget friendly, clean and easy accesible hotel.",3,0.9734
"I and my friends stayed 4 days in the hotel. Rooms were very clean, windows opened to market which was a bit noisy at evening and night time. The all receptionists are helpful, just asked them for good tips. They have few rooms without window, so when you book make sure what type of room you want. The atmosphere is brilliant around the hotel. If you wake up early go down, there is a doughnuts desk opposite to hotel entrance, dont miss it!!!!  The girl is so nice and the doughnuts are delicious! Only 0.90 ringgit/ each!! She open from Tue-Sun 7am-1pm!! :) Enjoy",4,0.9857

"I was really pleased with this hotel.  Right in the heart of China town but it was so quiet in our room.  The staff were really nice,  free safety deposit boxes in reception were a real bonus. Our room was clean on arrival and was cleaned every day ( we stayed for 5 nights). Wifi was really good with no problems and the air con was a God send! I don't have a bad word to say.  You get what you pay for. Our room didn't have windows but in the day we were out exploring and in the night it was lovely and dark for a good sleep and I guess it made the air con more effective so the room stayed cool when outside was 30+°.  Oh and free water.  If you get a good price then its a brilliant place in a great location. Thankyou hotel china town inn.",5,0.9969
"When arriving to this place our taxi dropped us off on the main road and said we would have to walk down the road to get to the entrance. Well, all I can say is waw!! This hotel is literally in the middle of China town, you can't even see the entrance due to the amount of stalls and people everywhere. Despite the craziness going on outside once we reached the reception you wouldn't have any idea of it as it was peaceful and quiet. The same with our room- you couldn't hear the outside noise BUT, and a big but, the walls are paper thin as you can hear every single thing going on in the rooms either side of you, even people going to the toilet! The rooms are a lot smaller than what they appear on the photos on the website and the bathroom is small, the layout is a bit unusual- our",4,0.6506

Bed linen and towels all clean and changed daily, bathroom was wet room as always, shower was hot and powerful but the sink leaked so good job it was a wet room, couldn't shut the bathroom door unless u were inside the bathroom which is odd... The a/c isn't a unit rather ducting so you have no control, was cheap price and you get what you pay for.",3,0.6652
"I'm giving my review Five stars because of price and location.  You stay right in the center of Chinatown which is in my opinion the greatest backpacker neighborhood.  The hustle and bustle and food choices and other tourists around make this a very special location.  MRT is not right next door but there are a few stations very close by.  The room I had was perfectly fine in every way.  Good bed, great little bathroom, AC worked perfect, had a nice desk.....but there was no window and in no way would you call this a luxury hotel.  Nevertheless I stayed here two different times for about 5 nights each time.  It was perfect for me.  If you can find a place with a nice big window or a balcony overlooking the action I would go for that instead.  But for a nice price and good sleep,",5,0.9929
"I come twice to this hotel, in an economy room, and always feeling satisfied.  It says just a fan with no aircon, but I found the room is already cool, there's a general aircon. The room is clean, the bathroom either. It's in the middle of petaling street, you can directly find shopping center right in front of the hotel. I can sleep well, not noisy at all. The bed is really comfort.  Recommend this for backpacker travelers. ",5,0.9611
"My partner and I stayed here for 4 nights in total on our way back from 3 months in Europe so we wanted somewhere cheap, comfortable, and in a good location. This is exactly what you get. We paid 70RM a night by booking on hostelworld. The room has a/c and tv and private bathroom. It gets cleaned everyday with fresh sheets and towels. It is right in the heart of china town which for us was great as it's close to pasar seni LRT station which links you to everywhere in the city, and the puduraya bus station for buses to the Cameron highlands and the airport. Staff were always friendly and helpful. Would recommend to any budget traveller.",4,0.9643
