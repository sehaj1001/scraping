"We stayed here in early March on the recommendation of friends, and the convenient location in Bukit Bintang. My best advice to current travellers is to request a room well away from the wing that has views looking down on the swimming pool. The noise coming from our room from the current construction was so loud it was not possible to sleep during the mid afternoon, and the room actually vibrated as a result. The room itself appeared tired and in need of a renovation with a musty smell with very few power points, none near the bed.  The hotel thankfully relocated us to another room on the wing facing Jalan Imbi which was much quieter. If staying here it is a must to request a room well away from the pool end of the hotel, otherwise  I recommend for its location and value for",4,0.936
We stayed for 23 nights and the whole experience was fantastic. We were welcomed warmly by Concierge Ravi on arrival from KLIA. He escorted us to the Orchid Club check in where Monica welcomed us with a complimentary drink. During our visit the Asst Mgr Orchid Club Rozanna introduced herself and made our visit special with her professionalism and friendliness backed up by her Staff. The young man who cleaned our room was brilliant. Over our last few days we met new Asst Mgr Front Desk Omar who was incredibly accommodating and so personable. On leaving he personally escorted us from the Club to our taxi. Honestly this Hotel experience is one of the best in Asia and we travel a lot. Thank you Park Royal KL. ,5,0.9853
"The hotel is very central and in a great location for walking to many of Kuala Lumpur's tourist attractions.  I stayed on the 15th floor and found the room to be very spacious, quiet and clean.  The view of the city from the window was beautiful.  The addition of a kettle and free bottled water in the room was a nice touch, along with the added safety information.    The staff were all very helpful, especially the ones taking my temperature at the front door.  The hotel restaurant had a wide variety of food available, especially at breakfast.  This could be improved by adding a note to specify what was vegetarian and what was not.   For a more in depth review of this hotel and Kuala Lumpur, feel free to visit my blog.",4,0.9847
"The room we stayed in was clean and comfortable with a strong wifi signal. Water pressure in the bathroom was strong and had plenty of hot water. The hotel is in a great location, close to shopping malls, entertainment area which is kids friendly, the street food market is just 5 minutes walk. Staff at hotel were superb, very friendly. Nothing seemed to be a problem to them. Breakfast was just amazing. The lobby lounge just very lovely. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to visit this city.",4,0.9897
"Downtown Kuala Lumper is about 70 kilometres east of KLIA the International Airport. We decided to take a taxi directly from the airport to our hotel which cost about 100 ringgit. – around £20. The taxi journey took about 45 minutes, although it could be longer than this in heavy traffic.  Although there are alternatives, such as using the express train, the relatively low cost of a taxi for two people with luggage made it the most attractive option for us. You buy a voucher from the transport desk in the Arrivals Hall and know therefore exactly what the price is going to be . The Park Royal hotel is located close to the Buckit Bingtang monorail station which connects directly to KL Sentral.  Although using public transport is a very inexpensive way to get around the city,",4,0.2716
"V friendly staff &amp; good facilities. Construction next door very noisy, even more noticeable if you are trying to relax by the pool on sixth floor, completely overlooked. I would avoid for rest of 2020, don’t when the construction is going to be finished.",3,0.631
"I stayed 4 nights and 1 night in total. I had regretted having booked the additional night in advance because staying there was super uncomfortable. So I wish I did not have to step a foot in this place an additional night. The location is central, but it’s the only good thing. The worst thing is I emailed the manager about the issues but never got an answer.   Not a 5* at all  - staff is unhelpful and unpleasant (we stayed 5 nights in total and the only staff member with a smile was Guna the bellman).  If you ask the concierge for an umbrella because it’s raining, he will just sigh and show you you annoy him (even if he does not seem busy) and very lazily give you one. No greetings from the staff during our stay: upon check in, I say hi and give my passport and staff just gives",1,-0.6862
"Stayed here for two days/nights. A very nice hotel with good facilities and friendly, accommodating staff. Breakfast was excellent. Wide in choice to cater for just about everyone, well cooked and food that should be kept warm was. In our respect there was one drawback and that was the quality of the glazing. We were in a room overlooking Jalan Imbi and a major crossroads on it controlled by traffic lights. The glazing did nothing to ameliorate the traffic noise.  It was pretty much constant, particularly from motorcycles of which there are many in K.L. Late evening, for a good deal of the early hours and early mornings they accelerated harshly away from the lights, engines screaming through the gears. If you are likely to be disturbed by this get a room that does not overlook",4,0.9633

"We enjoyed our recent stay at the PR in KL and particularly its location within the city.   We had Club Lounge access and enjoyed all aspects from breakfast to afternoon tea to the evening cocktail hour. The staff were extremely good at ensuring your stay was memorable. However there was one aspect that needs addressing and that is the definition of “smart casual” when it comes to male attire in the evenings. Unlike other PP and PR hotels in Australia and Singapore where the management is very specific in what is permitted and men are required to wear trousers, shirts and closed shoes. During the 4 evenings of our stay a number of men were wearing shorts, tee-shirts and thongs. I feel that this needs addressing and if this is the new standard of dress then be specific in the",5,0.9092
Neither my husband or I were impressed. This hotel is quite old and dim and needs updating badly. Concierge (Ravi) was an amazing fountain of knowledge for the area. Emilia was grudgingly helpful but if asked she would pass us to Concierge ASAP. We were asked for RM300 on arrival to cover RM10 tourist tax a day and any charges we charged to our room. 2 days later we were summoned to reception desk and told quite rudely we needed to add money as we were over by RM8. We asked why we couldn’t settle this when we leave and told it needed to be then. Quite rudely. Honestly we felt like we might scarper for a few RM. hotel pool is lovely but there is high rise building going on both sides of it. Unfortunately one side is same level as the pool level so workman and cranes and banging,3,-0.1435

"Reading the reviews I realized that people stayed at Orchid club tends to have better service in this hotel...  We stayed 3 nights for normal queen room.    Concierge kindly took our luggages on our arrival. But they were left in lobby few hours.  We went down to pick them up ourselves then were asked us if we wanted them delivered... no way wasting another few hours but took them ourselves.  After we got our luggages back and finally ready to take shower after long journey, we  realized no towels in the room.

"We had the pleasure of staying here for 3 nights in an Orchid Club Deluxe King room.  From arrival until departure, the hotel staff were amazing.  Always friendly, always smiling and always happy to help with any request.  Our room was excellent with everything you’d need for a relaxed stay and nothing was too much trouble.  We had the option to take continental breakfast in the Club Lounge or use the main breakfast area where the choice of hot and cold options were stunning.  The pool facilities were great (although a bit of building work going on) but it didn’t really detract from our stay.  Guests in the Orchid Club are also offered complimentary Afternoon Tea (excellent) and complimentary Cocktails &amp; Canapés from 6-8pm and the choices available are excellent.

"We had a wonderful time at this hotel. We booked a suite which gave us extra room. It was spacious and clear. The staff very very helpful and service could not be faulted. We  paid extra for Club access and it was worth every penny. The canapés and cocktails were amazing and we didn’t need dinner. Cocktails were in effect an open bar for two hours and the service provided by the staff here was exceptional,  Rey attentive.",5,0.9469
"Stayed here for four nights as part of a multi centre holiday. Well appointed location, close to a variety of dining, shopping &amp; entertainment options. We upgraded to the ""Orchid club"", which, for allowed for a superior room and other benefits. This is well worth investing in. Staff are knowledgeable, efficient &amp; helpful. The hotel is clean and the food &amp; facilities good. Due to some busy roads and ongoing construction work in the immediate area around the hotel, there can be some noise, especially during office hours, but this hotel is well worth a stay.",4,0.9513

"I didn't like staying here. It is quite close to what looks like a slum, quite a scary walk to the closest food shops and the check in process was really not friendly. The staff (male mainly) were not very helpful and they also tried to short us on change when trying to exchange currency. The room needs a modernising - our carpet was dirty with a blood stain under the chair. The bathroom was also very small. Buffet breakfast was less than ideal for westerners.  Overall, considering how cheap accom is in KL I would suggest spending a little extra and staying somewhere a bit nicer and closer to the other hotels.",2,-0.8421

The best location with Times Square &amp; Pavilion Malls very close and still in an oasis of calm &amp; quiet, as its on a certain height from the crowded road. Rooms are compact, but functionally great. Breakfast spread is the best I have EVER COME ACROSS, in my numerous hotel stays across the world, including luxury hotels.

Everyone had a wonderful time. Many of our guest had issues with parking, the hotel event manager provided us with list of parking lots around parkroyal which was helpful.

Breakfast was decent and had a good variety.  Check in and check out process was smooth.   The not so good: the picture and sound quality of the TV was very bad. There was a heavy storm when I was there which caused a loss in connection. Once the rain lightened, the connection came back on. But I Guess these Connectivity issues might be a norm there.   Breakfast sitting area could not hold a lot of people. Guests were asked to sit in an adjacent seating area and to walk over to the main restaurant for food.

The shower is over the bath. A sign offers a non-slip mat if requested - why not just provide it?  My biggest complaint is about the shower temperature. Both of us on 3 mornings had the same issue. Suddenly,  the water becomes boiling hot necessitating reaching through the hot water to turn it off. I reported this and was informed someone would come to investigate. This didn't happen. I don't believe the issue is within the room.   Don't bother with the weekend seafood buffet - a bit ordinary.  Pool is good.",3,0.8463

Fabulous restaurants everywhere but I would recommend the ReDYNASTY which is directly across the road from hotel at the entrance to Bukit Bintang.

The room was adequate and big enough for two people any more would be a waste.   I would love to see in the future “ In House” movies  provided  this would be a winner, as there is not a lot of choice on the Tv.

Check in was fast and front desk staffs are friendly. Room was clean and spacious.

Whole family have to wait standing at the entrance for a good 10over minutes inorder to get a seat. At least should have some chair for the guest to take a seat while waiting. Another thing is carpark is not free which maximum charge for per night stay is RM6. Although is a small amount but hotel shlould offer it free for the hotel guest.,4,-0.2153

The reception could have updated us instead of us going back and forth in the lobby to ask about the room status.  For someone who works in the hotels as well, I found this could have been avoided.  Other than this, we had an enjoyable stay and our requests from housekeeping for room items were met in a timely manner.",5,0.8421
"I broke my leg just before we arrived at the hotel, straight away the staff took care of both myself and my father. We were only meant to be there for 2 nights, but stayed 4,  while we waited for the insurance company to sort flights and medical care back home. The staff could not have done more, each day a member of management came to see me, we were given get well cards and gifts. I needed 4 hospital transfers by ambulance, and even though it disrupted the hotel, I was never made to feel a problem. The hotel is beautiful with so much to do,it was beautifully decorated and very clean, the food, which I had in my room was lovely. But for me the test of a good hotel is how they treat you when you are in a crisis, and the Parkroyal could not have done more to make us feel cared",5,0.985

More like 3 star standard. Very dated, stained carpets and bathroom very standard. On the plus side. Free wi-fi, HUGE bed which is very comfortable and lovely feather pillows. View as you can imagine is a city view so don't expect picturesque vistas. If you know what you're getting before you arrive you'd be happy. If you're expecting DELUXE you'll be disappointed.",3,0.9445

"Cold and sterile reception. No smile, no offer of assistance during check in and check out.  Booked club room and had early breakfast at the lounge floor. I am the only guest and no one attended to me. Had to walk up to look for the staff to take my order.  Evening cocktail hour - selection of food is limited. AND there is no drink list. So order what you think you feel like having and the staff will tell you if it is available. Really weird! ",3,-0.7171

I stayed at Parkroyal hotel kuala lumpur for two nights . Very nice hotel in the center of KL . Very close to all shopping and night life area . The hotel is very clean with very nice and friendly staff . Very safe and quiet area . The swimming pool is very nice . The room size is very convenient for a single traveller or a couple . The room is clean and very nice view of the swimming pool and the city . 4 shopping malls at 5 min walk distance . I recommend for single travellers or families .,5,0.9788
"I wouldn’t call this 5 star, but it was very good. Our bathroom needed a bit of sprucing up, but was still clean and well equipped with a powerful shower and a bath. The beds were comfortable and the room had a good view from the 8th floor.    Breakfast was superb, with a wide choice of Asian and Western food.    The hotel has lots of facilities, for example a swimming pool, spa , Japanese restaurant and large bar with entertainment. We didn’t utilise these during our 3 night stay as we were busy sightseeing in KL.    The staff at this hotel are excellent, friendly and efficient.   We found this to be a good choice in the heart of Bukit Bintang, the best part of KL to stay in. ",4,0.9959

This is my 2nd visit to the Park Royal and the hotel is still the same standard as my 1st visit. The location is great as you are at the heart of Kuala Lumpur golden triangle and everything is within a easy walk or taxi ride. There is also a metro station near by which is easy and cheap to use.  We booked a Orchid room and I would recommend this as you get exclusive access to the Orchid lounge which gets you free soft drinks throughout the day and afternoon tea and then in the evening you get some hot food and can get alcoholic drinks as well. Breakfast is also good and peaceful in the lounge.  Our room was very nice and looked like it had been updated in the last year or so. It was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. Pool is nice as well and WIFI is good throughout the,5,0.9916
"This is my 3rd time staying at ParkRoyal KL, as the safety of this hotel is always my favorite.  As for the room services, I hope the hotel can train their staff to have one standard procedure because of the first day I ordered room services, I need to pay cash and the second day another staff tells me I can charge under my room.   And the housekeeping, I think the staff need to check the room and bathroom for the cleanliness because, during my stays, they are water leaking in the bathroom and I did tell the housekeeping staff to find someone to fix it but I not sure he understands what I meant because when I go back to the hotel I still find the bathroom water leaking.   Excellent location which has a lot of shopping malls and restaurants.   Will stay here again.",4,0.8051
"This hotel remains one of the best in Kuala Lumpur. We stay here every year and the high quality of service is first class and beyond, This was our 6th stay and we are always amazed at the courtesy and high level of service. We booked the Orchid Club as usual and were given a higher floor which was amazing, the staff remain dedicated to the guests even calling them by their names and are ready to advise and help. The hotel is huge and has a really nice friendly atmosphere, even at busy times guests are served quickly and not kept waiting. The breakfast is plentiful with a massive choice of fresh fruit,juices etc, again with plenty of staff to cater for your needs. We like this hotel due to the amazing staff and the excellent facilities that are on offer. Our friends, families",5,0.9924
"This was our 3rd time staying in the this hotel each time has been excellent. The hotel is situated very central to many popular shopping malls.The staff are excellent especially HANI in The Club Lounge and the cleaner on the 5th floor including 514. The rest of the staff that we came into contact with from the conserge upwards were very helpful and happy at all times. Our advice is to anybody thinking about this hotel is to seriously consider a Club room it is well worth the little extra to have the privileges that comes with it such as buffet + menu breakfast in the club lounge (not so crowded),afternoon tea,evening canapés and drinks and private check in on the 6th floor.

Apparently there is a larger breakfast buffet downstairs but we never looked. Complimentary evening drinks and food available each night. Staff were so polite and professional. Very close to all major malls, transport and markets. Super cheap to get mono rail to central market. I want to go back!",5,0.8455
"My wife and I stayed at this hotel which is centrally located in KL. 15/20 min walk to the Petronas Towers. Close to major malls and food courts.  The room we stayed in was very comfortable and has a great view of the city. The room was somewhat 'tired' and master light controls were only located on the one side of the queen bed. A bit inconvenient if one slept at the other end of the bed when partner has already gone to sleep. Very good breakfast was served with a very good variety of foods catering for everyone.  Staff were friendly and efficient, but special mention must be made for Ravi and the lady who serviced our room - really wonderful people.",4,0.9606
"We have just returned from 4 days in KL staying at the Park Royal and it was just amazing. From the moment we stepped into the lobby the friendly staff made us feel welcome. Our room was immaculate in every way with a massive king bed and plenty of space to rest up. The staff at the Orchid Club are true professionals at their job and looked after us so well. We used the pool area, ate at the restaurant and had a stunning Spa session, seriously I felt brand new after that. The Hotel is located across from two shopping malls and the monorail runs out front. Taxis and Grab are easy to use and organised by the Hotel if you wish. A huge thanks to all the staff at ParkRoyal, you made our holiday so much better.    ",5,0.9851
"We didn't know what to expect so were impressed with the Orchid checkin and facilities. The food and beverages in the lounge were ideal and the ambience was so relaxed. The room was spacious and clean with a great bathroom and ginormous comfortable bed.

"Have stayed in this hotel many times and it has been the location that has been a key factor.  And the spa, Jess is one of the best masseuse in town and the spacation package was a good deal. So easy to walk to the shopping and dining districts of multicultural KL.  Which brings me to the first issue.  Broken side door.  For those who know this hotel, the side door is handy entrance to the outside world.  This was broken when we arrived.  No problem as we dragged our bags over the cobble stones, past the smokers, dodging the cars nearly hitting us on the not very wide drive leading to main entrance.  The side door remained broken for the entire 3 day stay with just a pitiful sign and no sign of work or repair.  It was a weekend and perhaps this hotel can't afford to pay workers",2,-0.823

The manager in the breakfast was amazing gentleman who asked us if he would like the chefs to make anything specific as we were vegetarians. I think this was really nice of him and the options for the breakfast were very nice. I have to say overall I would recommend this hotel if you are looking for something central to everything.

"We only spent one night at the ParkRoyal and wished we had stayed longer. The room was average but comfortable. The views of the neon lit downtown were impressive and helped negate the fact that the room was quite small for a 5-star hotel.   To make matters worse, at check-in the receptionist identified the room we booked as a double comprising “two super single” beds. This was a concern as we were a family of 2 adults and 2 kids and we were expecting 2 queen sized beds. The beds were actually American doubles, which although smaller than expected, probably worked better in the smaller sized room.   The bathroom was clean with a decent selection of amenities. Breakfast was again decent with a wide choice of foods reflecting the diverse clientele. The pool looked relaxing if we",4,0.9749

Low lighting level was seen at the interior of elevator, the corridor and inside of the room. Perhaps it could be the general style of the property to keep it elegantly dim.  Room is fairly clean. Good wifi signal but the TV resolution is bad. We got grainy picture throughout.  Access to the BB mono rail station is easy. About 10 mins walk. You get good service and food at the breakfast table.  Rated 5-star in some reviews. I cannot agree but definitely a passable stay. Good !",4,0.8146

"I booked four rooms here for a family holiday for a three night stay. Having stayed at Pan Pacific Singapore I was looking forward to our stay. Sadly disappointed. As previous comments state, the rooms are quite old. Old wood cabinetry. We asked for blankets instead of doona and they came with holes in them and holes in curtains. My husband woke during the night very itchy and felt he was being bitten under the sheets. I asked for complete change of linen next morning and this was only done because my husband was in the room and made sure it was. We were supposed to receive daily newspaper as part of our package but none arrived. None of our group really enjoyed breakfast buffet. Very ordinary. On the good side, hotel in great location.

Clearly a business hotel and lacking funding or desire to be renovated, let alone maintained, the rooms lacked any quality or refinement, even my bed had torn sheets.   The location of hotel really was its only redeeming feature not that you would know as getting any info from the hotel staff was rather hard.   Facilities very dated.
