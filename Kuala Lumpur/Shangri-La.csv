"We have stayed at the Shangri-La in Kuala Lumpur, so we knew what to expect.  I find it one  of the best value hotels, as the Horizon Club rooms and the suites are great value.  We splurged on a suite for the stay this time.  The suite was nice, but they are definitely starting to show their age in some areas.  The staff as usual were excellent, as they went out of their way to do as much as they could to help us.  The pool area was crowded, but you could find a place at most times of the day.  The only thing that really let us down was the Horizon Club Lounge.  We were travelling at Christmas, so we knew it would be busy, but we did not expect it to be almost unusable at times.  It was so crowded they had to start using the Japanese resturant, and even then, there was a wait",4,0.9666
"My friend and I travelled to Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Ho Chi Minh City to celebrate my 50th birthday. It was my birthday on the day we arrived at Shangri La KL.  We had booked a Horizen Club room, so up to the first floor where you are treated like a VIP.  No hanging around in a queue to check in, sit down be served a very welcome drink, and relax. Staff came to us when they were ready for us to check in. It was all very civilised. We were given the option to upgrade to a suite each, yes EACH! which of course we accepted. After all it was my 50th birthday. Our bags were taken to our room and although tipping won't hurt, no one was loitering waiting for one.  The room, err sorry, suite, was beautiful, as expected, with a spectacular view of the city and spotlessly clean.",5,0.9872
"A classic Shangri-La. First steps open a wonderful lobby. Room was nice with fresh exotic fruits and water service. Well located, only five minutes to KLCC and Twin towers. Bathroom is ok, unfortunately not enough space for own stuff.  Breakfast has a good choice but staff is making to much pressure in the last hour so you don't feel really cozy.  We tried also the Japanese restaurant in the hotel which offered us a delicious menu. Reception and welcome was nice but could be a little more enthusiastic towards guest wishes. All in all a trustful Shangri-La experience.",5,0.9812
"This was my second trip to Kuala Lumpur, and I absolutely wanted to stay at Shangri-La again.  The rooms and facilities are wonderful, the staff are all extremely friendly, helpful, and welcoming, and Shangri-La has the best buffet breakfasts and dinners of any hotel I've ever stayed!  For me, the location is perfect, close to the city's main attractions, and an easy walk to a convenient rail station, places to eat, shop, and fun nightlife.",5,0.984
"Good location, friendly staff, typical Shangri-La hospitality. The room was of a good size, quiet, and clean. The pool was rather small but still grand. Lovely breakfast. Overall it’s good, good value for money!",5,0.9801
"The room itself are nice, friendly staff and great location! They have few restaurants, i tried the Japanese one, so delicious! The Gym are also great, the equipment seems nice and work well.   Will come back! ",5,0.9769
Great hotel with everything details  Clean  Luxury  Friendly staff Always my first choice  And i can say better then four seance hotel  The food is amazing and the breakfast is perfect as The first meal of your day  Location is great as well less than 5 min walk to petronas  towers KLCC,5,0.979
"I am currently staying in hotel and leave on Monday. The hotel is very nice and  what you would expect from a Shangri La. But check in yesterday was poor. We checked in. The lady was sharp and barked out requests. There was no pleasant welcome. Fill this form in etc.. She informed me that check in was not till later. I knew this already because if she had checked she would have seen by request for early check in. She then said she had an Horizon room which came with tea and coffee in lounge. She gave me a form to sign. Before i signed this i asked her if there was any charge. She said yes and then told me how much. I declined. She then managed to find a room. Appauling. For Shangri la to do this, also with hotel very quiet and as golden circle member is very poor. It is our",4,0.5413
"The best of the best, the Horizon floors are just fantastic. The service is second to none, the location fantastic within shouting distance of the KL towers, the food is great with a choice of restaurants and swimming in the pool looking at the towers with 30 degree heat is an experience to behold esp coming from the UK after a 12 hour flight.",5,0.967
"Our go-to hotel when we fly via Kuala Lumpur and it never disappoints. We treat ourselves to a suite which gives us access to the Horizon Club, including breakfast, afternoon tea and happy hour.  Our first visit in over six years and the hotel is as glorious as always - cool, calm and spotlessly clean.  I couldn't imagine staying anywhere else.",5,0.934
"It was short yet very pleasant and memorable stay with Shangri-la! Special thanks to Bang Rizal for the smooth check in process (terimakasih for the late check out given), Pak Rajah and his warmest smile &amp; greetings whenever we passed by, and Miss Lynus &amp; Zafira for the quick chat when we checked out (Ps. Sorry we were late by 10mins for the checked out). Room was amazing and very clean. Will definitely come back! 💞💞",5,0.9767
"The Shangri La is a beautiful hotel providing first class service. It was our anniversary and we received cake, chocolates and roses, which made it extra special for us. The staff are friendly and professional. The service in the Horizon Club Lounge was excellent. We enjoyed a pleasant morning at the lovely pool and gardens, however pool bar service was slow. The international buffet breakfast was very good, providing small gluten free offerings. The hotel is not only close to the Petronas Towers but also to the Aquaria situated in the KLCC. Thank you for a memorable stay.",5,0.958
"How do you improve on perfection?  Because that is exactly what the Shangri- La is. From the location to the cleanliness, staff, facilities all first class. If you are visiting Kuala Lumpur look no further. Stayed here 3 nights recently on our way home from visiting relatives in Australia.",5,0.6597
Our second visit to the KL Shangri-La and just as enjoyable as our first visit 4 years ago. We particularly enjoy staying in the Horizon Club rooms and using the Horizon Club Lounge for breakfast and evening drinks and canapés. All the staff are very friendly and professional but special mention must go to Mr Azizi Latif. The hotel is in a great location being within an easy walking distance of both the Petronus Twin Towers and the KL Tower. Recommended,5,0.967
Shangri-La always has been my favourite place to eat because the serve good food. Then one of the staff Ms. Yune suggested me to stay at Shangri-La Kuala Lumpur. She helped me with the booking and some special arrangements inside the room. The stay was pleasant and i did like the room very much. It was very spacious with touch of yesteryear when i was young. Thank you ms yune !!!  ,5,0.9297
"The Shangri-La prides itself on it’s welcome. I had received what I considered, poor customer service at check-in, and was not shy in making my disappointment known.  In fairness to the management, although we were out all day, when we got back, there was a note under our door and a message on the phone, to contact the duty manager.  The management were truly apologetic and made us feel as though they understood the nature of our issue, and called it ‘constructive feedback’.  To be fair I was quite harsh in my comments.  Their attention to customer feedback honestly made me feel that anyone can make a mistake, but their truly excellent customer service, has turned around the initial negativity and created a positive experience.    I would like to thank the management for their",5,0.9603
"We arrived with our small children at Shangri-La around midnight and the staff was efficient and quick in checking us in. In fact, the entire hotel personnel was caring and professional throughout our stay. Our suite had a great view of the city and was thoroughly cleaned every day. We enjoyed the Horizon Club Lounge, it offered an outstanding service and great breakfast/ hors d'oeuvre/ drinks to its guests. We also loved the location of this hotel, just 10 min away from the Towers. Last but not least, the children got to enjoy the nice cozy pool. A delightful stay and will definitely return!",5,0.9852
"Our stay was nice, except we asked for an early check-in 2 weeks before the arrival, but the hotel staff didn’t confirm, so we arrived 6am in the morning and the guy in front desk didn’t know. So he told us to pay a full day for an early check-in, that cost us extra $US138 even though the room we booked is ready for us to check in that morning, a bit disappointed, the room is nice but smell damp, I know it’s been raining in February but still smell damp in the room, the house-keeping is good, everyday the room is clean when you come back, in room service menu is expensive, drink 10 beers in the room would cost the same as the room price per night.",5,0.8885
"Excellent city centre hotel well placed to visit the major sights in KL. The Horizon club rooms are well worth the extra but in any case, the hotel offers the highest standards as you would expect from Shangri-la.",5,0.5994
"This hotel has probably the best location in the city, not in the midst of madness but still not far from the key landmarks. Service is impeccable, food is delicious, room was immaculately clean &amp; staff are very efficient but polite. Horizon lounge is the best place to unwind from breakfast in the morning to cocktail hours. Concierge service gave us top notch recommendations for shopping and try local food. Truly a top Luxury hotel.",5,0.9825
"We stayed for 3 nights recently. Checkin was smooth, reception staff are very caring, service in horizon lounge is outstanding. Location of the hotel is very convenient, very close to all the major landmarks. We ate at Chinese restaurant and the food was simply delicious. Lobby is huge and beautifully decorated. Grandeur at its best.",5,0.9774
A lovely hotel in the city centre   Just a 10 min walk to the towers  The reception area is beautiful and staff are very welcoming  The rooms were very nice and a good size  Breakfast was lovely with a wide variety of food to offer ,5,0.968
"Excellent hotel. Very welcoming staff superb decor, what you would expect.  Special mention for reception staff and restaurant Service Manager in particular Pat Alexander, who  was so helpful and considerate, took the time to assist us in places to see and visit, attentive at breakfast and afternoon cocktails.  We will definitely come back. Hotel cleanliness top notch and maids cleaned rooms twice a day.  Loved our stay thank you so very much .  ",5,0.9844
"I stayed at Shangri-La KL to attend a conference held there at B2. The reception attendant was quite efficient and polite. The room was comfortable and clean as other Shangri-La. The desk was wide enough. However, the wind from the air-com went directly to the seat in front of the desk. That made me felt a bit freezing and not comfortable, and I had to turn off it. The only drawback I encountered. The bathroom functioned well. The in-room dining was tasty. The meeting place was spacious, with good audio and visual effects. Overall, the Shangri-La KL fulfills the 5-star standards and will surely provide you a pleasant experience.",5,0.9726
"We loved this hotel from the minute we arrived.   We we ushered into the club lounge for tea whilst being checked in. The rooms are large and well appointed. All the requests we had made were in place ( high floor, rooms next to each other) Pool was a decent size and not overcrowded.  The club lounge food and drinks were excellent and the staff simply delightful.   We visited during the Coronavirus outbreak across SE Asia, the hotel was taking proactive steps to check for symptoms in guests ( temperature checks for all every morning), which was completed in a low key, organised and sensitive way which can only be applauded.  This is one of the smartest, yet friendliest hotels we have stayed in. We will be visiting again, and we will actively seek out hotels in the Shangri-La",5,0.979
"I travelled to KL for the first time and had a difficult time to choose out of many five star hotels inter city. I am glad I chose Shangrila. It’s one of those hotels where you settle in very quickly just like at home. Highlight is the staff and the consistent high level service they deliver in every area of the hotel. Because of all the unfortunate cases of corona virus around it’s very important to choose a clean hotel and this count Shangrila stood out compared to some hotels we stayed in Jakarta and Singapore. Wish we booked Shangrila in those city as well. Many restaurants, delicious food and nice cozy pool are other advantages of staying here.",5,0.9599
"My husband came here many times on business and always raved about the Shangri-La in KL. This was my first visit with him and luckily I was not disappointed and loved the hotel.  It was a special anniversary and the hotel acknowledged this beautifully. The full breakfast in the main dining-room was amazing. I have never seen so much variety of dishes and as I am glutenfree it was wonderful to have so many choices.  We also enjoyed Arthur's Bar on one of the evenings.  Location was great and I particularly enjoyed sunbathing in the pool area because of the lovely shady gardens.  We used the Horizon club a few times and although the menu was limited for glutenfree guests, the staff were very helpful, offering to obtain whatever I wanted to the best of their ability.  Staying at",5,0.9909
"great service and staff, super convenient location close to the Petronas Towers and KL tower. amazing breakfast buffet with an international flair. nice rooms with great products. definitely recommend it!",5,0.9756
"Stayed here on a business trip recently. Fabulous rooms, spa, and restaurant and selection of bars on site and a few in walking distance. had a spa package one day, which was excellent..  Slept really well, ate in the restaurant a couple of times, lovely staff, very friendly to guests and helpful too. Top hotel choice for a business traveller",5,0.9492
"Spacious hotel in central KL, perhaps not as ideally located as some more recently-opened new hotels, but is well-kept, with an excellent breakfast choice. The rooms are reasonably large and well-appointed, and it is all kept up to a good standard.",5,0.8494
My second stay here....and it didn't dissapoint. I had the standard room and it had everything you expect in a five star. Only minus was that the plug socket was a little far....so I couldn't use my phone in bed while it charged. Location is another major plus. It is about a 12 minute walk from KLCC and about 7 mins away from a starbucks. The hotel also took plenty of measures to combat the coronavirus and make us feel reassured that our safety was paramount.,4,0.3182
"From the minute you arrive at the door the service is spot on. We stayed on the Horizon club floor, we were taken straight to the lift to check in on that floor. On arrival we were show to a table with a welcome drink, while the check in was done. The staff are fantastic, they are all so friendly and good at their jobs. The rooms are a little small, but have nice bed linen, and the products in the bathroom are first class. We ate breakfast in the Horizon club floor very nice, never to crowded. You can also get drinks here during the day, then from 5-00 pm until 7-00pm free drinks and food are available. What's not to like!",5,0.9576
"Our first choice for drinks is always at the Lobby lounge Shangri-La KL. You cannot denied the beauty of the lounge, high ceiling, spacious space, cozy seat, great drinks and of course amazing team. The great team Ziela, Jenny, siti, Ella always at presence to ensure our drinks is fill and to ensure we enjoy the time in the lobby lounge.  Last but not least, the amazing URB band provide the best live entertainment in town!! Sadly to know they are leaving soon until further notice.. they have been an iconic band for Shangri-La for years.. hope to see them in not distance future. ",5,0.9807
"From the minute you enter any Shangri La hotel, there is that smell and felling of confidence. Despite being 4am, our warm welcome and efficient check in then lovely room, where the comfort pointers that this was going to be a happy stay. The Club lounge offers all day friendly hospitality  - perfect for busy family breakfast,quiet day time work, evening aperitif with friends. Being CNY the decorations all over were tasteful and seasonal, and even ""family yoga"" was offered, which although only two guests came - it was zen and enjoyable; Shangri La thoughtfulness. I cnt wait to go back!",5,0.9883
"We stayed 3 nights over CNY as a family holiday. We had a fabulous time. Beginning with check in by Sean Lee. He was enthusiastic, attentive, knowledgeable, and just got things done right away without me asking. He even greeted me by my name when I walked by the lobby later. Felt really appreciated as a customer. He upsold me to the Family suite and it was indeed the right choice. My kids couldn’t believe they would be sleeping in a tent! Most of the staff we encountered from concierge and security to Horizon Club were super warm and helpful. A big shout out to Marsy, the family &amp; leisure manager. She is super around kids and goes the extra mile to make sure everyone is having a good time.  We didn't register for the kitchen tour but somehow she found space for all the walk-ins.",5,0.9508
"This is my go-to hotel in KL. Well located, well appointed rooms and well trained staff really makes a difference. We were here for 7 days. The check-in experience was quite poor. Our room was not ready when we arrived. We had a late lunch at the Horizon lounge and had to wait for almost 2 hours...plus I had to enquire multiple times and the last time was waiting at the counter while the staff called to check if our assigned room was ready. The staff at the next counter intervened and helped swap a room for a later arriving guest (one person making a difference). The positive was that they made it up by waiving off charges for lunch (another one person making a difference). They delivered the wrong luggage up to the room but then quickly found the right one. From that point",5,-0.2398
"The warmth and hospitality exuded from  everyone in the hotel. Conveniently located near the best attractions, Shangri La definitely kept to its name and nothing was too much for them. My husband and I were celebrating our anniversary and from the moment we checked into reception it felt as if we were truly being welcomed. They had left beautiful gifts in the room and made our occasion special. It was such a pleasure relaxing in the hotel throughout and the food we ordered in room service was mouth watering. One staff member we have to mention was Anwar Deen in Customer Relations who was charming and most helpful. When my partner had left New Years celebrations to the last minute to book Anwar took over and sorted everything out recommending the local W hotel for dinner. Look",5,0.9913
"Have stayed in a few on these hotels but this one is the best yet! Great location, walking distance to the Petronas Towers. We had a suite which was huge and we also had use of the Horizon Club facilities, which are well worth the extra cost. Breakfast, Afternoon tea and early evening drinks and nibbles all included. Staff are so friendly and helpful, nothing is too much trouble. Outside pool with good facilities, very well equipped gym.",4,0.9876
"I was with my wife and parents for two nights over Christmas. Everything from the airport pick up, to the check in, to the staff was too good.  I would like to mention Lynn and Lynux both of front office. They were exceptionally good in their welcoming.  The rooms were spacious, clean with an amazing view. The location was extremely close to the street walk, petronas towers, metro, etc.  The food was just wow! The horizon lounge was exceptional!  Highly recommended!",5,0.9734
"This hotel used to be one of the top options in KL, but it feels a little that it had its day. Upon arrival no-one helped us with our luggage (we had to put it ourselves through the scanner). Check-in was swift, but more like in an efficient 3-star hotel. The room was quite small and somewhat dated, albeit in excellent condition, with a microscopic bathroom (one sink, toilet in the room, no bath). Bedding is luxurious and very comfortable. Breakfast had the atmosphere of a noisy food court, with staff taking our cutlery off used plates and putting it back on the table. The Shangri-La is still a beautiful hotel with very comfortable rooms, but not much about our experience was 5-star.",3,0.9823
Rooms are very clean. Nice pool with bar. Breakfast was amazing. Location was perfect. Very happy with the friendliness and pleasant attitude of the staff. Would definitely come back. Good job Shangrila.,4,0.9826
I had been a tour guide for 26 years now. Last week I brought a group of American students to check in at Shangri la Kuala Lumpur and was pleasantly surprised by their overwhelming support and customer friendly approach towards the group and me. There was an unprecedented attention to details and hotel guests relations officers such as Ms Izyan Zulaidi and Mr Peter made a vast difference in their preparations for the group's check in process as well as prompt assistance during check out after a three night stay. Well done Shangri la. I shall always recommend you whenever a travel agent consults me for advice.,5,0.9393
"Initial impression, second night of a 7 day stay. Staff, service  buffet breakfast and location is 5 star Rooms look and feel tired. Hence 4 stars. It is an internationally recognised hotel brand that is being slightly let down by  rooms  being a bit tired. Would be a shame for them to lose custom to newer kids on the block, of which there are many.",4,-0.9118
"After reading various positive reviews and articles about the buffet i was disappointed at the service offered by the Shangri-la. K9no The service staff was extremely overwhelmed from a corporate booking and could not handle the volume. We all want to make money, that's understandle but unfortunately the level of flow up and competence was horrifying. At a certain point the staff was too busy setting up tables for next day breakfast and could not be bothered to check on the guests still eating. As five staff were busy setting up coffee cups there was no serving staff assigned to any zone to follow up on the guests and apart from other details this was a trend which unfortunely affected the experience one expects from the Shangri-la.  I thought I did my research well but was left",1,-0.6663
"Beautiful hotel located in the city. Rooms and restrooms were clean. Rooms were also very comfortable with 24 hours room service. Hotel staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Nice pool with a bar. Lots of facilities available, gym, spa, restaurants lounge. Location was amazing, close to restaurants, shopping, entertainment and also the the twin towers. Breakfast buffet had a good spread. Hospitality by the staff was amazing. Will stay here again for sure. Love the lounge in the lobby area. Good job Shangri-La. Looking forward to seeing you again.  Terima Kasih, Bala",5,0.9914
"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel, excellent service and excellent buffet breakfast.  So much variety and healthy too.  Very reasonably priced too, was cheaper then my room at holiday inn atrium in Singapore and much better room and breakfast",5,0.9601
"Even more luxurious than the sister hotel in Yangon. Centrally located, so easy walking to Central markets (20 min) or KLCC (5 mins).  Lovely helpful staff. Good food  Shame it’s raining currently but this is the view from our window",5,0.6778
"You can see over the years that the quality is decreasing... When you have banquet tables (at least 20!) set up in the lobby, you know already that you are not in a luxury hotel anymore The horizon club used to be the best club I knew (see my previous review few years ago)... now, for cost cutting purpose, the club is just average... no more the variety which used to have",3,0.4389
"Just had a three night stay with my family in club horizon rooms. Attention to detail was impeccable. Rooms lovely very clean and beds really comfortable. Worth paying the extra for the Club Lounge access. All staff fabulous, courteous and on the ball. Special thanks to Pat, Sean and Sherry for making this stay perfect.",5,0.981
"I have stayed here a few times and The Shangri-La never disappoints.  There may be new kids on the block hotels in Kuala Lumpur, but having experienced other properties in the city, the SL is now my first choice.  My latest stay was in a suite which was VERY spacious and included a small kitchen. Horizon Club access was also included.  When I stay here, I always tend to oversleep - that isn’t a criticism, but testament to the quality of sleep I always seem to enjoy at the SL.  As my stay was over the busy holiday period, the Horizon lounge was very busy, however, service was never compromised. The staff in the lounge were excellent despite the very demanding workload and they still managed to make contact with guests, find seats and clear tables. Food was good and kitchen staff",5,0.9599
"Centrally located hotel, just a short walk to the Petronas Towers and many restaurants and bars.  We stayed in an executive suite during our 3-night stay, it was clean and with great views of the KL tower.  The furniture in the room was starting to look tired along with the bathroom suite.    We had access to the club lounge during our stay which was busy every evening but catered well for the numbers &amp; service still being delivered to a high standard.  A good selection of savoury, sweet and hot and cold dishes.    Overall a good stay and I look forward to returning.",4,0.9501
"Nice hotel to hold meetings or conferences. Buffet spread is reasonable wide. The laksa &amp; satay is nice done. Room is large and comfy. Hotel is located 5 mins away from the mono rail station, Bukit Nanas. Traffic around the hotel could get bad during peak hours, hence access to the mono rail make a big difference to get around. Cons: TV in the room is small and hint of smoke smell in the toilet ventilation.",4,0.2732
This was our second stay at this hotel and it's still five-star!  Fantastic buffet breakfast in the Lemon Garden cafe with the tasty and huge variety.  Well appointed room with very comfortable bed and nice view.  Great service from reception to housekeeping to breakfast wait staff.  A nice and tranquil garden at the back of the hotel offers some respite from the busy city vibe.  Great value hotel and I highly recommend.,5,0.9835
"We continue our stay with the Shangri-La group, this trip with Shangri-La Kuala Lumpur to share fifty years of togetherness with my wife. Simple efforts like arranging a rose for her, a high view room decorated with floral petals on the bed, a chocolate cake and a box of chocolates came as a great surprise and fully touched by us. Thank you to all staff.",5,0.9081
"The view of the golden pagoda is not the only beautiful view from the elegant club lounge. Interesting tapas every evening, in large variety. For breakfast, you'll have a full meal, made to order if you want, to help you start your day. I appreciated the exceptional friendliness (which I like better than the word ""service"") from concierge Aung Ko, from Chef Phyo, Service Leaders William and Alvin, plus Zaw, Nue Thet Htar and Zar.

Staff were very friendly and helpful, buffet breakfast was delicious with a variety of cuisines and room was clean and comfortable.

"We arrived at the Shangri-La New Year’s Eve afternoon, a busy time for the staff no doubt. The front desk staff were warm and welcoming, even giving us a room upgrade which was a lovely surprise for us. Feeling a bit peckish we ordered room service. The food was really very good which to be honest was a bit surprising considering they were busy getting ready for their New Year’s Eve celebrations. It was a credit to their kitchen staff. The facilities at this hotel are fantastic. They have a lovely pool area and a gym that any health club would be more than happy to have. The buffet breakfast was impressive. They had a wide variety of food and flavour types, so you should be able to find whatever is to your taste. We really enjoyed our stay here, great location close to food,",5,0.9924
"Not my first Shangri-La hotel experience so I had high expectations. Our stay at Shangri-La Kuala Lumpur was simply unforgettable. It felt amazing to see how much they care about the guests, this hotel has extraordinary hospitality skills. We stayed at the Premier suite which was super nice, I love the separate living area with an office space. The suite was impeccably clean and very comfortable. The first night we arrived late and were exhausted so we ordered room service for dinner, and the food was really impressive. Breakfast at Lemon garden was fantastic, all kinds of cuisine for you to choose from and a dessert pavilion out of this world. We also had lunch at Shang Palace, the food was delicious and the restaurant is so beautiful. Dinner was at Latife, and I still dream of",5,0.9909

"I am a huge fan of all things Shangri-La and this of course is what I have grown to expect from their impressive properties. A very classic atmosphere with class and sophistication through elegant architectural features and tasteful design. 5 star service on all fronts from all areas. Always a warm and pleasant welcome from everyone upon entering. High quality restaurants with an amazing fitness center, pool and spa. We were upgraded to a suit which had an extra seating area and office that we absolutely loved. The location is great and only a short walk to the twin towers for great views and shopping. If you are ever in Kuala Lumpur this is the place to stay!",5,0.9889
"We booked taxi service beforehand and I do have to admit that it was comfortable and easy way to travel to the hotel. During the check in our booking (Horizon club room) was upgraded to suite (minor compensation only) which was a nice surprise.   If you appreciate good service with a pinch of luxury you should book a room with club benefits. Horizon club provides breakfast without crowds, afternoon tea 3:00 p.m., cocktails and snacks 5:00 p.m.  Hotel is located in a perfect place and you can easily reach most of “to see places” by walking.

"We stayed in Kuala Lumpur to celebrate New Years Eve. As we have never visited the city before we was unsure if the hotel would offer anything for the New Years celebrations.  Upon arrival at the hotel the service was fantastic. Some slight concussion at check in as to if our room was ready baring in mind it was 15:30 so it should of been however this was soon rectified.  For breakfast the hotel offered a wide range of options however I feel it offered too many options some of them just wasn’t to my taste.  This hotel is fairly central to shops bars and restaurants, for the twin towers and shopping mall it is approximately a 10/15 minute walk away.  If you plan to go up the towers do book it in advance we didn’t and couldn’t go up as it was fully booked. The hotel did offer a",5,0.8316

"We have stayed at this hotel several times over the years and it is always one of the best Shangri-la hotels we have enjoyed. The Horizon Club staff are great and always try to give the best possible service. We only stayed 3 nights on this occasion but wished we had stayed longer. The only disappointment was at check in. We were taken to the Lounge for a drink on arrival, but the idea of coming to our table to check in was not ideal and I was asked for my credit card which was taken away and then not brought back. I went to the front desk to find out what was happening to be told they were ""just about to do it"". I wanted to get to our room to unpack but when we got there our luggage was not. We had to phone up for it to be sent up. The room was clean, comfortable and there was",4,0.9039
10/10 so far. Nothing is too much trouble for the guests at the Shangri-la hotel. Breakfast was excellent with many choices &amp; even a gelato bar. What a great idea to start your day ! Special mention to the very lovely Rozie who fussed over me &amp; even brought me a local speciality to try. All delicious. The rooms are spacious &amp; quiet. Treat yourself when next in KL.,5,0.9617
"The room we had was great and absolutely spotless,staff from front desk to housekeeping was friendly and really helpful. In room dining services was top notch and varieties of choice is unbelievable. The hotel  have great facilities not just the gym and swimming pool, They also have good restaurants(Chinese,Japanese, French and Western). Breakfast is the best in Kl( second to non) and lastly what we like the most is ""The Lounge""  overlook a pond with tropical forrest background.We went twice during our stay during recent stay.We will go back to Shangri-La for sure and highly recommended",5,0.9835
"We stayed for two nights on our way to Sydney. Beautiful hotel and great service. The staff couldn’t be more helpful in helping us sort a couple of taxis and day trips and also had a lovely pool area which we used briefly. Also used the gym facilities, nice big gym with modern equipment and plenty of it free even at busier times.   Rooms are a very generous size, beautifully decorated and sparkling clean. ",5,0.9881
"We decided to celebrate our 10 year anniversary here at Shangri- La in KL. The hotel staff made us feel so nice, our room was decorated so nicely and we recived some lovelly gifts and roses. This made our anniversary extra special so thank you very much. The location is beautiful and when we went had amazing Christmas displays! It was very busy but thats normal this time of the year and plus its in a very central location (walking distance from everything).  The only issue we had was that when we ordered a drink to our room, the concierge (a male) did not give me the tray to hold unless I signed the bill. This may seem like a small thing but to us it was very insulting.   THANK YOU TEAM.",5,0.947
"I cannot remember the number of times I have been here, but Shangri-La KL has always been to me a 5 star establishment from room condition, meeting facilities, restaurant etc, EXCEPT for this time, during check-out, the reception staff while sorting out the confusion in the number of complimentary breakfast for my stay, spoke in a condescending tone. I have stayed in many of the Shangri-La group of hotels, but this was the first time I feel slighted.  After giving feedback via the Golden Circle app, the manager in a matter of a few hours, offered his apology which I accepted.  I hope Shangri-La ensure their front staff are properly trained to handle issues of the guests.",3,0.9332
"Love Love Love our stay at the Shangri-La Hotel KL.  Unfortunately only 3 nights we stayed.  Everything is perfect and the service is amazing.  Particularly all staffs at the executive lounge and manager Zie, they made us feel so welcoming all times and really understand how to look after the guests.  I am from hospitality in Australia and wish  some of our locals would understand what good customer services are.  You really gotta love what you do as customers can see that.  I am sure you that all staffs at the Shangri-La Hotel KL love what they do and do what they love most too.  Thank you again and look forward to our next stay with you guys.",5,0.9934
"My second stay at the hotel in 2019 but this time with the family. Everything was perfect no issues at all. The lounge staff and everyone at the hotel were all child friendly. Although a city centre business hotel , there was no shortcomings regarding family stay. The gym, spa, leisure facilities all first rate. Very large breakfast spread . Overall a thoroughly enjoyable stay",5,0.8761
"Shangri la Hotels always take some beating and this is also right up there.just not quite as buzzing in the dinning areas,and bars a bit dowdy ,say compared to Bangkok or Hong Kong.But this is not an area to stay to many days in,very clinical, and a ride on an open top bus pretty much covers it.but if you are in this area of the World this Hotel might distract the short comings of this some  what boring destination",5,-0.3612
"Last night, we were fortunate enough to celebrate our New Year’s Eve Countdown for 2020 at Shangri-La.  This is a great hotel and the entertainment provided for the New Year Eve Party was absolutely Spectacular! 🤩🤩🥳👌 The DJ played a good mix of songs while we waited for the band.  The Back Up Dancers were truly exciting to watch. They did a good job in getting the party started and kept it going. We were amazed and surprised when Ms Sarita turned up with her Fabulous Entrance during her opening act and her whole performance which was absolutely entertaining. We also love Marlou’s amazing voice. The whole band did a great performance overall!  The DJ played music all through out the evening and we danced to every single song.

"Our recent stay was rather disappointing for a 5 star establishment. No attention to detail and customer service. Firstly the check in took extremely long and delayed almost 30 minutes plus. We booked three rooms, rooms was not allocated on the same floor but without issue we accepted rooms on two floors.  No welcome drinks provided which was rather strange if the hotel claims to be 5 star. No evening turn around service provided either.   Seems like the hotel was rather busy for breakfast, guest was asked to have breakfast on the first floor which was sib standard and variety limited.   We requested a late check out for one of the rooms until 2pm but was refused.   Overall experience not great lacks customer service not what you would expect from a 5 star establishment.

We stayed here in Sept 2019 at the Family Suite with a tent set up for the kids in the living room. It was a pleasant surprise for them and the kids really had a good time with all the kids activities planned out by the hotel . The kids corner at Horizon Club was very welcoming too. We will be returning soon.,5,0.895
"This hotel delivered everything it promised ... and more. We stayed in an executive suite and enjoyed every minute. We were welcomed as if friends and treated like royalty at check-in. The Club lounge was great with lots of delicious food. Not keen on the cocktails, though. Our Singapore Sling bore no resemblance to the genuine thing. Overall, I would definitely recommend this five-star hotel.",5,0.9661
"From our own personal hotel car pick-up from the airport to the Valet, to the reception to the Club...this was our second visit and all staff continually welcomed us back. Clever customer service but very good feeling as a guest.

Sensational spot to holiday.",5,0.9857

"It has been several years since we last stayed here, and it does look like the hotel management has been doing some good work.  We stayed in the one-bedroom suite, which was spacious and comfortable. My family loved it, which makes it worth the price for me. The only minor complaint I have about the room is that they have limited sports channels on TV, resulting in me having to miss a soccer match I was looking forward to watching that weekend, as I did not relish the effort of leaving the suite at 1am to catch the match elsewhere.  Service was excellent 90% of the time for us. Check-in went without a glitch, which was a major relief for me after having to drive 7.5 hours from JB in the torrential rain that resulted in crazy traffic on the highway. Every single staff member in",5,0.9349
Stayed here this month. Very nice hotel. Only complaint I have is the room was a bit small. Staff were very friendly. The breakfast was great. I had beef tenderloins for breakfast. It was the best. The swimming pool was very big and clean. Would recommend. ,4,0.9615
"What a great hotel, older property with character and really friendly staff. We had use of the club which was excellent for breakfast or afternoon tea (or just a drink).

"My family and I stayed here for one night, honestly not the best stay, and definitely not what I expected from a so called “5 star” The rooms are old style and the carpet just seems a little grimey, also noticed my dust allergy was set off! Telephone had stains on it and just generally rooms are old style.  The hotel overall has good service, as we stayed during Xmas period they had kids of kids activities as well as a beautiful Santa’s grotto and tree.   Breakfast buffet was cool though, massive choice!  A little disappointed as it was my first time at the Shangrila and I expected much better.     ",3,0.9218
Every time we use this brand we like it more and more.  This is a well located hotel to enjoy a city break in this capital city. The Petronas Towers and shopping centre are less than 10 minutes walk.  Took comfort is also good (albeit I am not a fan of the pillows they provide ) providing good storage. Service quality was very good throughout with all staff being very helpful indeed for which I thank them. The lounge is a nice place to relax and have a drink. We also had a couple of nice evening meals (cheaper price than the other in house restaurants). Breakfast is good with a healthy variety of choice.  Recommended ,4,0.988
"Booked a club room for 3 nights. the check in at the lounge was easy and we enjoyed the lounge whilst they completed the admin. The lounge was excellent all round, the service impeccable, food and drink offerings very good. The only strange thing was that having had a glass of sparkling wine on arrival, when requesting a second one during the cocktail hours was told that only one glass was provided, and no more. Unusual and very petty. The 25th floor room was excellent, clean, spacious and comfortable with city views, although no view of the Petronas Towers which are about 10 minutes walk away. Transport options are wide and easily accessible, including Monorail and Free Bus, Shopping malls are close by as well as more traditional sights and attractions. And the people are so",5,0.9805

From the lobby to our room, from the delicious breakfast at lemon garden to the canapés at Horizon club, from fish feeding for kids to the welcoming attitude of the staff, from the ever-smiling staff to the beautiful arrangement made for our anniversary, everything was TOP-NOTCH. The location of the hotel is ideal &amp; Petronas + KL tower both are so easily accessible by walk. The privileges of horizon club are a bonus!

"My husband and I walked in for breakfast (recommended by friends for its extensive buffet selection and good food). Service: the hostesses greeted us with welcoming and warm smiles which is a good start. We were then shown to the table set up for 4 people by the window. Service staff was attentive but took a bit of time to clear our plates. Could have assumed we were not done with the food as the plates were not empty. Nevertheless, they should have anticipated and asked what is wrong with the food and maybe take our feedback to the culinary team or management. It was a busy breakfast service so we do not want to distract them. On to the next important topic - FOOD. Chicken and beef sausages were dry. Cereals were soft (as they were displayed in openly, exposed to air. Could",3,0.8965

Staff were very friendly and we enjoyed our stay but the hotel does seem quite dated. Our room was nice and clean and we didn’t have any problems during our stay. I will say that although there are lots of options the quality of the breakfast wasn’t great in comparison to other hotels we’ve stayed and was definitely overpriced for what we got. Would also recommend highlighting more clearly the ingredient content of different options on the buffet to make it easier for travellers with dietary requirements.,3,0.9822
"Back again in Shangri-la - entrance area and reception with well trained staff - they always have a smile for you and try to help you.  check in process is ok  rooms are spotlessly clean and well furnished, but style could be seen as a bit outdated. comfortable beds and nothing missing in the bathroom.  the pool area isn't too large but enough to enjoy a cold drink. in our case they ran out of Asahi beer - strange for such a large hotel  tried the hairdresser this time - got a good cut, but it was a bit overpriced   Breakfast is really great as always - there is such a large variety of choices.  hotel location is ideal",4,0.9833

"Had a very unpleasant experience with thee billing practise of Shangrila.  On 11th November, i did an early checkin.  Upon checkout the reception mentioned it was waived in goodwill.  I assumed, this gesture was due to my diamond tier, being the highest level.  I checked in again on the following week.  Upon checkout on the 22nd Nov, I was informed they have to back charge me the early checkin as the reception made a mistake.  This was insisted by the Manager Mr. Sachin.  What was most despicable was not only he did not come to see me to explain when I requested, but this was done during checkout when I was in a hurry.  Hence you would not have time to dispute.

I only managed to catch 4 hours of disturbed sleep as the room had bad traffic noise.  I wonder why such a wonderful hotel does not soundproof their rooms.  We complained when we checked out and told them we will be checking in again in a few days time and want a quiet room.  This time we got a really quiet room.  Despite a night of bad sleep, the hotel delivers very well in all aspects.  Staff are helpful and smiling, facilities are fantastic, breakfast is a wonderful spread.

I really cannot fault this hotel or any Shangri-La Hotel but on this visit it let me down in one respect.  When checking into the hotel they ask for a swipe of your credit card to pre authorise in this case £300. This means that they block that sum of money on the assumption that you will spend it in the hotel. In my case we spent £80 so when we came to check out I would have assumed that would just be taken from the £300. That was not the case as they took a further £80 on top of the pre authorised amount meaning that my CC was blocked for £380 and had to wait over a week for the £300 to be released. What is the point in blocking £300 on check in then taking more on check out. I can only compare this to going into a restaurant and before I order my food they want to take a,5,0.2659
