"We booked the hotel during the promotion rate with inclusive bfast, extra bed for kids, late checkout and afternoon tea at thirty8. And i must say that was the best deal ever! We booked deluxe room which is HUGE and plenty spaces for the kids to run around. The gym, sauna, whirlpool bath are all accessible and we fully utilized them.   But the breakfast spread was not as nice as I thought it would be. Limited choices of food, not as good as other 5star hotel in KL and gosh it was so hot and sweaty since the seating area are all by the window.   We spent most of the time at the pool too as they provide kids float and kickboard. You can use the gazebo with great view of klcc too! We ordered snacks from the cafe and the portion was HUGE and good enough for my kids to gobble in",5,0.8362
"First step that I approached the hotel, was warmly greeted by a young awesome lady name Roos, and also provided me the chocolate as a family member (this is wow), then approached the Lobby which located on 39 FL. with the view of Twin Tower (this is stunning)  Thank Peggy who was helping me to check-in and had such a lovely conversation and suggestions for some cool places to visit by (if you have a chance try Iron Fairly KL) and had a chance to meet Hazali the head of security there, that made me even more safe with the service.  Plus the bar on 38 FL was also one of the best spot here, was taking care by Mr. Mee (Assistant Manager of Bar), he has such a connection conversation and feel like here many times before  It's a must place and all the people here treat me like a",5,0.9909
"This is my 10th times staying in Hyatt. Guest services always tip top. Hyatt facilities, spacious room, and hotel management/ crew were the BEST and most professional I can say. Most importantly, we always feel welcome in here. ",5,0.9067
Grand Hyatt Hotel was the nicest hotel at extremely reasonable prices. Location is amazing and located next to KLCC with underground tunnel. Was a Marriott member but will always choose grand Hyatt in Kuala Lumpur.,5,0.8591
"It was an excellent hotel in KL, Malaysia. The staff were very friendly.  In addition, the rooms were extremely very clean  and spacey as well. It was peaceful to sleep in the rooms. The swimming pool was amazing",5,0.9616
"A very friendly and welcoming staff. We got breakfast included as a complementary service at check in. And free coffee while waiting for them to get the second keycard. The view was incredible, the room was very clean and the breakfast was great. Recommended!",5,0.9592
"the Grand Hyatt Kuala Lumpur is ideally located with easy walk to KLCC and Bukit Bintang area. The staff are exceptional in their approach, linking this with the high quality of hotel makes it the only hotel I will use. 5 Starts - definately.",5,0.8271
"Pulling up at the Grand Hyatt and asked to check in on the 39th Floor (Skylobby) was novel, the first time. Then it became irritating that you had to go to the 39th to then catch another lift down to the floor for your room.  Be careful of which room you choose, there is a lot of construction in the area and a Park View room may end up being a view of construction adjacent to a park. If you're in KL for some work and some relaxation be mindful of where the TV is located in your room, most are located above the desk, which means you can't be working and someone watch telly at the same time.  The Breakfast experience was average and not up to the standard of other similarly priced hotels nearby. Unfortunately, the Grand Hyatt in KL relies on a Nespresso machine to make your coffee",2,0.7845
"Having my memorable date to be celebrated here is so fascinating!  -Nice view, definitely -Great staff - Mr Izhar  -Best Food -Amazing ambience   overall it makes my day worth to be memorable &amp; cherish for a very long time!",5,0.9851
"Service is Outstanding!  Every single interaction with staff is highly professional.  From the bell staff helping with bags and doors, to check in, elevator attendant, food service, spa, pool, everyone.    Of course the sky lobby and view of towers are impressive.   My room was huge, very comfortable, panoramic views of KLCC and Towers.   Welcome fruit tray and I do like that no plastic water bottles are used. Club lounge is spacious, excellent food and service. Breakfast is also great.  A lot of choices.  I sampled the different stations: Western, Chinese, Indian, Malay, Middle Eastern, juices, pastries, noodles, etc. And of course the great views. I also enjoyed the 2nd floor pool, gym and spa. Location is great, adjacent to KLCC and Petronas, and short walk to shopping area ",5,0.9901
"We had a 5 day stay at the Grand Hyatt in Kuala Lumpur which was our first visit to this city.  The Grand Hyatt is perfectly located across from the KL Convention Center, the Suria KLCC mall and Petronas Towers.  Lots of restaurants in the area.  Booking the Club Lounge gives you a full buffet breakfast in the morning and hot &amp; cold foods plus drinks for 2 hours in the evening.  The rooms are spacious and comfortable.  A good base for a stay in KL.",5,0.9468
I was in KL for a conference with my same sex partner. We spent 5 nights at the Grand Hyatt and were very impressed with the personal touches that hotel staff added to our stay. From check in where we were up graded to a tower view room with fantastic views of Petronas towers to our last day when we were provided with extra amenities to take home the hotel staff went out of their way to make our stay special. On one of the mornings the buffet breakfast had run out of probiotic yoghurt and one of the waiters noticed that we had missed out. The next day he came to personally find us and provided us with a double helping of the drink. On our last morning the breakfast staff who had looked after us during our stay went out of their way to wish us all the best. This is my third visit,5,0.9617
will definitely stay again everytime i am back in KL...for sure!! Fantastic feeling. location is really very convenient with sheltered walkway/bridges to KLCC and Pavillion. no time wasted on the traffic,5,0.6467
We had a short staycation over the weekend and enjoyed every bit of it.   It’s still have the best views of the Twin Towers and the surrounding KLCC Park.  Food was super delicious and services was on par with the rest of Hyatt Group.   We had our room upgraded to the Grand Executive Suite which was a sweet touch from the team as this room had a wrapped around views the whole towers and park. Beautiful scenic views from 32 floor.   Only thing that a minor setback to the whole experience was the furnitures in the rooms we stayed was looking tired and worn out.   Apart from that you can find faults with the hotel.   We always love to find reasons to stay here...even on spar of the moments.   Looking forward to our next staycation! ,4,0.9729
"This is possibly my 6th or 7th stay at GHKL since it’s opening. Despite the low occupancy due to covid-19 , it doesn’t feel that service has improved but rather has deteriorated. There are less reception staffs and waiters at breakfast leading to poorer service for a5* hotel.",3,-0.2006
"Nice clean and modern hotel, within walking distance of shops and restaurants.  Nice breakfast (plenty of choice) and swimming pool.  Possibly a bit under-staffed once you leave the (high profile of) the ground floor.",4,0.7964
"With a strong affinity to this wonderful city dating back twenty years, it was a real privilege to stay here to celebrate a special occasion. We booked a room with tower views and were upgraded, treated to a meal, given a beautiful chocolate cake and just recipient to so many kindnesses that we can't thank the hotel and its wonderful staff enough for our incredible stay. Would love to name names, but to do so would neglect those whose names we didn't catch. A truly happy occasion, made by the Grand Hyatt. Thank you all so, so much...",5,0.8998
"Mixed feelings here, but ultimately great recovery by the staff. The experience started with a call to extend our stay and to upgrade our room: the response was ""call back in 30 minutes because our reservations team is at lunch"". We were very puzzled by that response. On a good note: the check in counter on level 39 is definitely a statement, with full view of the petronas towers. The breakfast is served on the level below, also enjoying full view of the towers. On a less positive note: On arrival they gave us a King Deluxe room with city views. The furniture was tired and abused, Overall the feeling was not a welcoming one, no personality. What did it for us was that the timber floor had some bubbles that were filled with smelly water from the nearby shower. To calm our nerves",4,0.9493
"This Hyatt offers an excellent downtown location in KL. Just a short walk to Petronas Towers and many other amenities / services in the surrounding area. Hotel is clean, staff is very professional and friendly. Breakfast service in the restaurant is amazing - great quality food for every taste around the world.",5,0.9569
"The rooms are spacious, clean, extremely well-decorated for a comfortable business stay. Every utility is available, and my favorite thing was the usage of glass bottles across the hotel and conference rooms. Super initiative!",4,0.9254
I've been staying here for the past 6 years. I have no complaints whatsoever about this hotel. A premium hotel with a warm touch. You will be taken care of from the minute you confirmed your booking up until the check-out. ,5,0.0516
You mentioned Hyatt uses responsibly sourced food.... your breakfast don't even serve free range eggs and I had lunch at Teres they had steroid hens . This is quite unusual for such a  highly rated group not to have considered the implications of serving battery hen eggs and battery farmed hens.,3,-0.4023
"Had a great stay. Nice pool and fast &amp; very helpful service. Bed was comfy, rooms are quiet and bar/restaurant has a great selection on drinks and food. Room bar charges for water bottles but you can have free glasses of water at the lobby. The outside pool and quite big and nice with great view on the Petronas Towers.",5,0.9714
"Great location, really pleasant and clean rooms, but the thing that makes this such a good place to stay are the staff, the room, beautiful lanscape at the hotel and the swimming pool, good spa, nice venue for the breakfast. All of the people are incredibly helpful and generous with their time and advice.  Thanks to the hotel for the memorable experience and definitely will come back for our next vacation.",5,0.9912
"Grand Hyatt KL is a beautiful hotel. Excellent and attentive staff. The view from every part of the hotel is   fantastic and not disappointing. They also served excellent breakfast. However, did not eat at other times as the price is a bit expensive (maybe for non-Malaysians its not).",5,0.9663
"I have been a loyal Hyatt member for many years and I am gradually seeing the drop in quality of Grand Hyatt KL over the years. The basic room amenities are no longer fully provided, certain amenities has to be requested. The in-room dining is no longer satisfactory, they recently changed it but only by a bit. The room cleanliness and bed is still excellent. The front desk personnel, gym and in-room dining personnel are very friendly. Gym is still in good condition. I like the fact they have taken a step to provide glass bottled water rather than plastic bottles.",3,0.9667
"Excellent hotel close to the Petronas Towers. Helpful, kind employees. Great breakfast and happy hour specials (and the ground floor restaurant is excellent as well!). Location is great and would happily stay there again if I’m ever back in Kuala Lumpur. ",5,0.984
"Overall, this is a great hotel. The rooms are nice and big, but a bit dated. During my last stay it rained and the window in my room was leaking. Not a huge deal, but indicative of the condition of the rooms.   It’s just a cool hotel overall with an awesome lobby and restaurant with a nice view of KL Tower. You can also walk to the mall nearby for good shopping.   I always stay here when I visit KL and you should too. ",4,0.9602
They hotel is strategically located in the heart of KL. The hotel and management staff lives up to the name “Gand” in Grand Hyatt. Enjoyed the personal touch that made my stay very memorable and will certainly return for future visits.,5,0.8271
"Grand Hyatt KL is truly a home away from home when I visit KL. Located next to KLCC, it offers great views of KLCC and the rest of the city. Walking distance from many major malls like pavilion and offices, the location of the hotel is convenient.   The Grand Suite (seen in pictures) is an amazing room. It is extremely spacious and comes with 2 bathrooms attached to it. The bathtub can easily fit 3-4 people! You can even request for one that faces the twin towers (might be more expensive though).   The hotel offers amazing facilities like a full gym, beautiful pools and club room. The club room offers daily breakfast and evening canapés. Evening canapés are amazing (more like dinner actually!) And comes with free flow alcoholic drinks like wine and beer.   Last but not least,",5,0.973
"The receptionist Ms. Daria, she is very helpful and friendly. She anticipated my needs. I really enjoy the stay. Room is clean with nice ambience. No doubt there was some hiccups in the restaurant but overall I’m still happy with the stay. ",5,0.8995
"Brilliant hotel with really lovely staff who made an occasion we were celebrating truly special. The location is also absolutely fantastic near KLCC Park and can recommend the Petronas towers view rooms if available.  Notwithstanding all of that I am not ashamed to say that breakfast was the most amazing thing about this hotel. It had to be the best choice, quality and presentation we have experienced and cannot recommend it enough.  Overall a great base for exploring KL or just relaxing by the lovely pool area.",5,0.9937
"All good but the breakfast is Halal therefore no bacon, ham, sausages etc.  This is an international multicultural hotel imposing Halal food for all.  For a five star hotel like Hyatt, I would expect better. Everything else, good.",4,0.8591
"The grand suite room was very huge. Our room has an amazing room with full frame window. The toilet was very spacious and we love the bathtub. The bed however was quite firm, but we still able to sleep well. Would love to go again next time.",5,0.9455
Stayed overnight for a business meeting and dinner. Better than expected service and excellent rooms with amazing view of KLCC. The mattress is exceptionally comfortable - had real quality sleep despite being away from home. Breakfast spread is also very good but probably lacking in the variety of meats and cold cuts for the western section.,5,0.7425
"In first, express sincere appreciation to hotel staff from booking to check out.My family and I were highly satisfied all kinds of services and specially kindness always. Even short stay, we felt enjoying everything what we can do in KL like as fantastic panoramic views and food and conveniences as well. One of the best stay in my experiences.",5,0.9796
"Grand Hyatt Hotel is so cosy, could spent the whole day just inside the hotel..excellent pool, 24hrs gym and great restaurant. just a walking distance to KLCC center and parks. Easy to walk around KL as KLCC is a great transportation hubs. Well done Grand Hyatt for our wonderful stay.",5,0.9716
The view from 38 restaurant is breathtaking and the ambience is relaxing with great service. The foliage rich with greeneries helps. The breakfast spread is adequate with dried wantan mee to stewed brisket...lovely I dian fish and chicken curry. .I will be back in a heartbeat..tq Grand Hyatt KL. Katheryn was wonderful with a quick and warming checkin.,5,0.9769
"The Deluxe Kind Size room with the KLCC Twin Tower view is fantastic.  The members of staff are attentive and proactive.  The Club lounge is nice with good food and drinks for the evening happy hour. The check-in lobby, the restaurant at Level 38 as well as the Club floor at level 37 have very nice view of the down town KL and the world tallest Twin Tower building.  ",4,0.9726

"I just fell in love with Hyatt and finally decided to become a member after some travels with Hyatt.  Well long story short, I would like to shout to Daria who went all the way from check in until departure. She is truly a hotelier and professional. She ensure that everything is running well. Well done.  Of course not to forget all the staff are extremely friendly and did an excellent job.  Breakfast is the best in KL by far.  I am Looking forwards to coming back soon.",5,0.9827
GrandHyatt KL stay was awesome and the hospitality of staffs was great. Better than expected and strongly recommend for folks planning to visit KL. The location is in prime spot and access to all your needs are stone throwaway distance. ,5,0.9403
The hotel is located within walking distance to KLCC and Pavilion. Room is very clean and I particularly love the wooden flooring in the bedroom. Special thanks to Grand Hyatt KL for a special cake to celebrate a special occasion.,5,0.9755

"The service at the receptionist was good. The room is big, clean with luxury design and totally beyond expectation. The hotel location is next to KLCC park and, Aquaria and KL Convention Center. Bukit Bintang shopping area just nearby with walking distance. Had one of the best breakfast experience here. ",5,0.8689
"With top notch amenities, courteous and helpful staff, and excellent location, this hotel is one of the best we've stayed in. Buffet breakfast at Thirty8 was a little disappointing, the menu doesn't change for the 3 days we've been there, but dining at JP Teres made up for it, with excellent choices that has something for everyone.  Hotel is just walking distance from the Petronas Towers, Suria KLCC shopping mall, Pavilion shopping mall, etc. In fact, if you book one of the Grand View rooms, you can get an excellent photo or selfie with the Petronas Towers on the background, so you really don't need to walk all the way there for it.  All in all, a highly recommendable hotel if you're looking for a great place to stay in Kuala Lumpur.",5,0.9855
"Front Desk service was excellent. But disappointed with the housekeeping and the in room amenities. Buffet breakfast was wonderful - both food and service, alot of choices especially local dishes. So it's average.",4,0.6486

"This was our second stay at the Grand Hyatt KL and it was just as excellent as the first time. This property makes me fall in love with Hyatt all over again.  The staff is absolutely excellent - great service - totally on point at every step!   The rooms are beautiful and the views keep me wanting to stay awake at night just to look out the window. Super comfortable beds, great showers and very soundproofed quiet rooms. Very good food in the lounge, room service and restaurants. Perfect location to get around KLCC. Beautiful pool too. We stayed for 6 days and did not have a single experience that was less than excellent (how often can you say that about a hotel stay?).  All I can say is... I can't wait to go back!",5,0.9944
"The view is nice, directly to twin towers, exactly like what is on their website. Staffs is friendly and helpful. Food was okay.

"We had a fantastic time at Grand Hyatt for our honeymoon. Great service overall, very friendly and attentive personel. Must try the amazing cocktails made by Qadir at the hotel bar. He is very friendly and gives great tips for places to visit.. Going above and beyond with his service. Delicious breakfast and dinner at the hotel restaurant. Thank you for a unforgettable experience!",5,0.9862

Outstanding Club Lounge cocktail time. Spectacular views of the Twin Towers. Highly recommended.",5,0.9863
Welcoming and professional service at The Grand Hyatt made our stay very enjoyable. We would particularly recommend the Jterre restaurant and bar on the ground floor where one can enjoy a range of Asian cuisine.,5,0.9335
"Superb experience at the Grand Hyatt. Especially thanks to Ryan McMullan, assistant director of F&amp;B, and Juliana. They made our stay memorable with their incredible service. They were approachable, accountable, friendly and went the extra mile to make our stay special. We would definitely return to the Grand Hyatt, KL for the 5-star service and the staff.",5,0.9678

"About 500m away from KLCC. There is an underground tunnel from the Convention Centre that leads to the basement of KLCC. Good if it's raining and you do not want to walk by the side of the road.  Rooms are very spacious and luxurious. Depending on the facing, you can potentially get a full view of the Petronas Twin Tower. The bed linens were one of the most comfortable I've slept in.  Despite its height, there is no outdoor rooftop bar. There is a restaurant 1 level below the reception though. If you're a cigar smoker, you will need to contend with the outdoor terrace at the street level.  Service is very good and the rooms are clean. The pool looks inviting and nicely landscaped.",5,0.9367
"The hotels looks comfortable and clean. Check in went friendly and efficient. The Breakfast is good with large choices.  And yeah Overall fantastic stay. Enjoyed staying here, thanks for the hospitality.",5,0.9774

"We stayed 6 nights and were sorry to leave. The WOW factor started on arrival, at check in on the 38th floor and continued throughout our stay. The views from our room, the restaurant, the lobby were spectacular, day or night. The pool and restaurant on  the second floor had a resort feel to it... and the gym also had a steam room, sauna and spa (separate for male and female). The ESSA spa was pure bliss.  The location of the hotel is central and convenient to everything.  What makes this hotel great is the staff.  Everyone we encountered made us feel special from the moment we arrived and on departure we were even  presented with parting gifts of chocolate &amp; sweets! Each member of staff was friendly and helpful and took their time to chat to us.  A special mention to Firdaus",5,0.9795
"I can understand why this hotel receives such glowing reviews.  The bed had the exact firmness that my husband and I like.  The upgraded suite was absolutely beautiful, the housekeeping very efficient.  The selection of breakfast choices from the buffet was phenomenal - if they didn't have it they would make the effort to find it.  Spa services very professional.  Gym well equipped.  What is of particular note as the hotel is quite large - it was very impressive that members of staff greeted us by name and remembered our preferences for breakfast.  There are really too many people that I'd like to acknowledge but a special thanks to Katrina in the Club Lounge, the Director of Rooms and Julianna in the restaurant.  This is really an amazing hotel with very dedicated and friendly",5,0.987
we had booked grand hyatt due to its proximity to the famous Petronas Towers.  one can just view the towers from thier lobby and you can choose the tower facing rooms which are just awesome.  property is just 10 minutes walk,5,0.802
"Good hotel for relaxation and staycation.  It is also near to KLCC twin towers.  Big club room, nice food and environment.  The view from restaurant and club lounge is amazing especially at night.  Must try the spa massage. Truly amazing.  ",4,0.9618

"Need to attend an evening event. The traffic entering the hotel is perpetuallly snarling. Remember to arrive earlier or leave before the rush hour.   Nonetheless, great location for hotel guests. Near to the center of KL.  The hotel is just adjacent to the KLCC park. Excellent for morning joggers.  ",5,0.8225
"I could spend all day highlighting the amazing things about this hotel and its attentive staff! But I will try and keep it brief.  - Everyone is incredibly helpful, everything is meticulously clean, the location is perfect to walk to malls and food, the staff are happy to help you find tours/taxis (or grabs) and everything else, the food in the hotel is some of the best we have had in Malaysia (try the JP Teres Nasi Ayam or Kaya Jam toast!) even the room service. Special hats off to Oliver at 38 who looked after us incredibly well when there was some miscommunication and we were early for our (delicious) afternoon tea! Hats off- I will try and come again just to stay here and in the AMAZING, spacious, well designed rooms (with great views)- and certainly explore other Hyatt",5,0.9927
"I first stayed at this hotel 3 years ago and thought it was great but standards have dropped. I expected that my request to replace all feather bedding and pillows with hypoallergenic ones would be met, but on both stays in December (3 nights in mid Dec, a break in another city, then 4 nights over Christmas) I arrived at the hotel to find that it had not been done. I’ve stayed at 4 other hotels recently and not had this issue. As a World of Hyatt member, I expect more. Rooms are spacious. The bathtub was stained, probably due to age. Avoid city view rooms which are close to lifts as they are noisy. Breakfast is expensive. JP Teres, the ground floor restaurant, is good. The best thing about this hotel is the location, next to KLCC and a covered walkway to Pavilion, but I would",4,0.9127
"Spent 4 nights at this amazing hotel. Clean and comfortable,ideally located.Room setup was modern. Breathtaking views from the lobby and restaurant unfortunately my room (2203) views were not that pleasing.  Friendly staff Array of foods for buffet breakfast. Will definitely be back. ",5,0.7348
"Positive: Clean and comfortable room, restaurants too.  Negative: I booked with Club Lounge Access room... A lounge was too noisy due to many people. It is insufficient service of 2 items free per stay, i strongly request per night!",4,0.8718
"Great ocation, hotel was wonderful.  Club floor lounge as expected.  Staff very accomidating, made reservations as requested for dinner and spa at other hotels.  Hotel pick up is the only way to go as it is a long drive from the airport to hotel. Lovely city",5,0.9118
"I can’t say enough about this hotel. From the check-in process, to breakfast, to room service, to the facilities, our experience (my husband and I) was perfect. The property is absolutely stunning, and the entrance to the check-in counter upon arrival above the 38th floor is spectacular. If you’re planning to stay at this property, breakfast is a must. The quality and quantity is top notch. The service was also excellent and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful.   The hotel is ideally located in KL, with a pedestrian walk behind the hotel, connecting you to the Petronas towers, KLCC mall and many other spots around the city. Lastly, and most importantly, the fine dinning restaurant on the 38th floor (which is also where breakfast is served in the morning) is delicious!",5,0.9819
Great hotel by all means.. Modern design and great views.. I was given a corner room on the 26th floor overseeing the park and the twin towers.. A great view to wake up to in the morning.. Staff were very cooperative especially Joyce from the front desk,5,0.9231
Our favorite hotel in Kuala Lumpur! We stayed in many hotels in this area before but the service in this hotel is the best by far!! Excellent!! Can improve on comfort of bed by using a real boxspring beds and not table top type with mattress on it. ,5,0.9692
"My favorite hotel!  We arrived early in the morning, so our room wasn’t ready yet.  After a long flight we really wanted to shower and eat, so they took us to the pool spa area.  The facilities are amazing!!  They have everything you need and more.   The rooms are beautiful, the pool is amazing, the view from the hotel and our room was insane, and the staff were all very friendly and helpful.  We loved the complimentary coffee and juice bar in the mornings.  Everything just worked  ",5,0.9827
Our stay at Grand Hyatt was absolutely incredible and will recommend to our friends as well. Staff was very helpful and cooperative Cleanliness and hygiene was well maintained Food quality was amazing and we will be visiting the hotel again,5,0.9565
Nice View (Cool reception base at the top floor)/Great Breakfast spread (Variety choices)/Great Room/Great customer service skills (The staff even walk through with us to show us where's the praying room),5,0.7269
"We had the most relaxing stay at this great central property in KL. Firstly, the pool area will just suck you in and you won’t want to leave! Very well equipped fitness centre for when you have eaten too much!  We were lucky enough to enjoy the Grand Club that offered an excellent breakfast and cocktails (and a whole lot of food) in the evening. Service was exceptional at a very busy time!  Rooms were quite roomy with great views. Super comfy bed!  The only downside to the room was a bit of a lack of privacy when there was the family for changing due to the design of the bathroom.  Would absolutely return here in a heartbeat!",5,0.9844
"Good - Room are great, breakfasts are excellent.   Bad - I was so pleased with the room, I went to the ground floor to ask what type of room that I am staying in. I approached the counter at the ground floor near the exit door and asked the gentleman by showing my key card folder ""May I know, is this room a standard/lead in category? and if it is, may I know what room category it is called?"" He was not sure, so he called his colleague named Azimah. She came with an attitude and looked at me and said Ïni bilik biasa ajerrr"" and to my dismay she repeated it 3 times.   I understand that it was new year's eve and Grand Hyatt were full with higher rate from normal days but I strongly believed it is not Grand Hyatt policy to answer guest on a decent question sarcastically.

"We stayed at Grand Hyatt KL for a week in Dec 2019. Great location, great food, friendly staff and well worth the money spent. The rooms are spacious and  clean and children friendly. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting KL.",5,0.9778
Nice stay. Beautiful breakfast venue overlooking the park. Beautiful rooms.  Very good service by the staff.   If you are looking to spends lots of hours on the pool then it might not be your first choice as the pool doesn’t get too much sun light during the day. Maybe 2-3 hours in December.   Otherwise a really good choice and value for money.   ,5,0.9606
"Room quality is cheaper than other country’s Grand Hyatt. 1st, bath room is small. Especially, bath tub is inconvenient and danger.  2nd, noise pollution of corridor and elevator hall are awful.  If they focus on bathroom, I won’t recommend here.",2,-0.5106
"My wife and I decided to book a night at the grand Hyatt as a staycation.  The room was unique, not your typical layout.  I do like the location as its within walking distance to KLCC and also bukit bintang.  We'll be staying here again the next time my wife and I need a night out. ",5,0.6705
"This is one of the finest and the best hotels I have stayed so far.  The check-in was a breeze and staff were very friendly and accommodating to your needs.  The rooms were superbly done and very spacious with a great ambiance. Quality of sleep was very good.  All in all, a superb experience! The only gripe is that the lobby being situated in the topmost floor, one has to always take the lift to the lobby and then take another lift to reach the ground floor area. There is no lift that directly takes you from your room floor to the ground floor.  Although the food at the restaurants were good and presentable, I have tasted better food at other 5-star hotels. There is definitely scope for improvement in this area.  Having said that, I highly recommend this hotel and given a",5,0.9865
"Nice room overseeing the KLCC park. Would definitely book the room for KLCC tower view on my next visit. The food at thirty8 was excellent. However, some of the items on the menu was sold out despite it was on 9 pm.",4,0.8481
"We stayed at Grand Hyatt in a Club room with Club access in October for a work conference. It was our first visit to Malaysia and also the Grand Hyatt.  The level of service far exceeded our expectations. From arrival, to being escorted to the amazing Club reception and personal check in (with upgrade) in the Club Lounge. It was seemless and exactly what we needed after a long flight.  We stayed for a week and my partner was often alone and chose to dine in the Club Lounge.  The service was excellent, a great variety of food and the views of the Petronas Towers was stunning. Most nights we were attend to by an exceptional young lady, Mint, who took time to and share much about her country and tips on places to visit and food to try.  We highly recommend Grand Hyatt (with Club)",5,0.9781
"I traveled with my year-old toddler. We had the most splendid experience there. Every staff there was so attentive. Zuazreen constantly checked in on us at the club lounge to see if there was anything more that she could do for us - especially for my child. The food at the lounge and also the breakfast spread were very sumptuous. It was a very healthy spread, good enough for my daughter who only recently turned 1. The rooms were spacious with lots of natural light. Beautifully maintained and very clean. Choose this hotel when you travel to KL. I will choose Grand Hyatt KL, always. ",5,0.97
We recently stayed at the Hyatt in KL. The rooms were not ready at check-in at 5PM!!  We waited an hour for the rooms to become available.  The hotel was well located and quite pleasant but the guest rooms are poorly noise insulated and we could clearly hear conversations next door. A couple of night we could not sleep due to you d children next door. The hotel were apologetic. The breakfast buffet was excellent but the food in the JP Teres resturant was very average. There are good restaurants close by. The Hyatt Lounge was excellent ,3,0.9768
"Had an absolutely wonderful stay at this hotel! Anyone who comes to KL should stay here. I came here with my husband and toddler and was welcomed by genuinely friendly staff.  Breakfast is a spread of choice and cocktails /dinner is super great. I give special mention to Suazreen(Mint) and Isham...they were amazingly attentive and attended to my family with so much dedication and warmth. I stayed one day short of a week  and their smiles and service never flinched for a  second. Iv stayed in many hotels and im used to the ""pretentious""  service (esp to people of colour) but at Grand Hyatt Kuala Lumpur....you get genuine welcome, concern, assistance and an incredible stay. Il definitely be back and 100% recommend ",5,0.9823

We had 2 nights Christmas holiday. Stayed in kingroom with club access. Service in lounge very good. Food and drinks at par with other Hyatt hotels. Lobby is on top floor.

"This is my 3rd time staying in this hotel and still, loved the experience so much! Location is good, walkable to KLCC, Suria KLCC and even Bukit Bintang! Morevover their breakfast is so awesome, with a lot of varieties to choose from!  Overall i loved it here and definitely coming back again!",5,0.9675
"My small family checked in at the hotel in December 2019 and requested for an early check in (2 hours before the normal check in at 3pm). The hotel was able to accommodate to this request. The hotel location was great, walking distance to Suria KLCC and Pavilion. Since it was raining most of the time we were in KL, the underpass to Suria KLCC was convenient as well as the walkway from the hotel to Pavilion. This is the third time we have stayed in the hotel, and the service remains to be excellent. Breakfast was also amazing as there were different varieties.",4,0.9287
The hotel is great. The room they gave to us had a excellent view outside facing the petronas tower.  The staff are friendly and accomodating.  They will surely accomodate your requests immediately.  We were surprised that they gave us a cake because they learned that we are celebrating special occassion.  Perfect 10 for this hotel,5,0.9774
"This is the hotel if u r coming here to holiday. I love everything from the check in to the staff and the rooms especially location. The location of this hotel is excellent whereby i dont need to take grab or taxi to go to their shopping centre like Pavilion or KLCC. It just 5-7 mins walk. Everything else its just perfect, ",5,0.9501
Customer Service was excellent from the moment we arrived. Staff was proactive to Facilitate the Check in Process and ensured we were comfortable and occupied while waiting for our room to be ready. Breakfast Buffet is one of the best we ever had with a great view of the city. Walking distance to KLCC and Pavilion Shopping Mall.,5,0.9666
"Although we stayed here just one night over the weekend, the experience was very pleasant. The room was large, clean with classy amenities. The waiters at JP were very polite and helpful, as were the ones at the pool. We will be back, for sure. Grand has lived up to its name and beyond. ",5,0.9589

Excellent hotel in a very good location. My room had fantastic views of the surrounding areas including the twin towers. Was very clean and comfortable.interney worked well and food was very good and everything was within walking distance,5,0.957
"This is the second time we’ve stayed here when in KL. Lovely views from Sky Lobby, Club Lounge &amp; our room (Petronas Twin Tower View). Great selection of drinks and food at the Club Lounge in the evenings.   Staff are very helpful and friendly. Very convenient for KLCC &amp; the convention centre. ",5,0.9388
"Another excellent stay but just take note if they have a function during your stay, finding parking in the hotel carpark could be a pain. First time having to park in basement 2 instead of 1(First world problem - Never had to park at basement 2 during my previous stays) and when we checkout on the next day, my guess was correct. Basement 1 carpark had many empty parking lots which was occupied by the others who came to attend the function; and we drove back to the hotel at around 11 pm the previous day.",5,-0.8338
"Excellent room service. Really good experience overall. They even managed to extend us a complimentary late check out. Everything in the hotel is really really good. Though a bit more expensive than the typical 5 star hotels in the area, it is somewhat worth it all. Highly recommended. ",5,0.9467
"Hotel is in between the  Pavillion and KLCC. The rooms are clean, and whatever we needed was always on hand. Service is always with a smile and staff are very considerate. We were never bored with the views from the club lounge and the breakfast buffet area. They have a great team at the Hyatt. This is our fourth stay at this hotel.",5,0.9478
"location is very good situated in heart of the city. breakfast have many varieties like indian, malay, western etc. staffs are very friendly. Room is neat and clean. room service is good. But lobby is in the top floor so lift system not so good.",4,0.9689
"Great location in the middle of KL with a 10min walk to Petronas Towers. As a hyatt globalist member I used a suite upgrade and got a beautiful corner suite with one of the most massive bath tubs I have ever seen - which I continued to spend hours in.  The club lounge is on the 37th with views of Petronas Towers and a good spread of food and drinks. As a globalist you can chose to have breakfast in the lounge or in the main restaurant on the 38th floor, which was a feast!  The gym has the latest machines and was quite large. The pool is large and was never crowded once - perhaps because it doesn't have any views that would draw the Instagram crowd (or my lovely wife) to it. Great for relaxation!",5,0.9744
"The hotel is truly beautiful with well designed rooms. You feel absolutely refreshed and relaxed! The view is stunning! The pool area is delightful. And the dining area gives you breathtaking views. If you can peel yourself off the hotel, the walk to Pavillion is only 6mins and thankfully pleasant since it's covered and air-conditioned. A must stay when in KL",5,0.9807
Hotel is very clean with accomodative staf.  I als enjoyed the food for breakfast. It was just nice. I would recommed business travellers to try the hotel.  I also try to walk around the hotel and found that it is located nicely around KLCC. ,5,0.8999
"Great Room, Clean and Quiet. They prepared a free delicious cake for us in the room. Thanks Hyatt. The services was great, the Check in was smooth and the check out was fast. Even register as Hyatt Member. ",5,0.9709
I stayed one night here. The room is huge!! The ambience is very romantic. Comfortable and cosy. The view of the KLCC tower is stunning day and night. I didn't take the breakfast service so I don't know how it tastes like.  My slight con: The shower is transparent through the bedroom. Although I don't mind - I didn't really know whether I can dim or cover the transparency (if I feel self-conscious). Maybe I can cover or dim the transparency However there were no instructions nearby that mentioned this.,4,0.9073

"Stayed here for 3 nights in December. The service is very good. My friends luggage was lost on the way and the concierge were all very helpful with trying to help call the airlines tho the bag never turned up.   The location is very good. Walking distance from multiple malls, the towers, Jalan Alor Night Market, and the Aquaria.   I had dinner at 38 which wasn’t the greatest experience. The food was ok, not great and the service was very poor. I essentially had none which I mentioned upon check out and the manager comped my meal which I greatly appreciated.   I was also appreciative of the upgrade to the petronas towers view. The gym is pretty big and well stocked for a hotel gym and the pool very nice. Breakfast was quite good as well. I’d stay here again if I find myself in KL",5,0.9859
"Stayed with my wife at Grand Hyatt Kuala Lumpur for a night. Received excellent service all round, in room as well Grand Club Lounge. Very attentive Hyatt Team right from Concierge on arrival and departure and throughout our stay.  Definitely recommend this Grand Hyatt, Kuala Lumpur  ",5,0.9584
"Staff at the Hyatt were extremely polite and helpful, from the conceirge , check in reception , as well as the restaurant. The check in reception is located at the top floor of the hotel which gave us an excellent view of the Petronas Tower. The restaurant Thirty 8, which is located at the thirty 8 floor serves excellent dinner and breakfast. The restaurant waiter Azhar was extremely helpful and service oriented, he was very patient and serviced us well even we finished our meal past the closing time at the restaurant. We were ushered to the Grand Club Lounge check in area and was served by Hong Yit. He was extremely service oriented and offered us a late check out the next day as we arrived very late at night. This offer had given us enough time to rest and explore Suria KLCC.",5,0.9663
