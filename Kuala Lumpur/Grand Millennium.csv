Great location in the hub of KL. Handy to MRT and LIght rail system and shoping malls. Walk to Petronas  towers in air condition comfort . Great cheap local food in lane way next door to hotel entrance. Staff very attentive especially in lounge. Could not fault except for pool area closing to any sign of rain.,5,0.9179
"I stayed here with my mother for a week, we were visiting my niece who was studying there. The hotel is very well situated, really central to all of KL's tourist sites. The train station was only a 2 minute walk and the Pavilion shopping mall next door. We also walked over to the Petronas towers via a covered walkway, it was only a 10-15 min walk.  The hotel staff were very friendly and courteous, any time we rang down to reception for something, we would get a call about 5 mins later to check we had received our request. We stayed in Feb just after the Coronavirus breakout, there were bottles of antibacterial hand-gel everywhere for guest use, the door staff used a hand held digital thermometer to check everyone's temperature on entering the hotel. This was done politely and",5,0.9127
"I've stayed at the Grand Millenium KL a few times over the years. Every time they've impressed me with a quality experience.  It may not be the newest hotel in KL but the location is great and the staff are (generally) first rate.  Only complaint is the team at the pool spend waaaaaaaay  to much time staring at their phones and not enough time looking after the guests.  By contrast the ladies in the lobby coffee lounge are the best!  Rooms are spacious enough, clean and comfortable.  Given the choice I'd happily stay at this hotel every time I go to KL.",4,0.9818
"My ""Go To"" Hotel for KL.I always receive a warm welcome from the staff and so check in is always easy.Thanks to the FOM Yuvasunthary for making everything smooth. The hotel is diligently checking temperatures of guests on entering the hotel, which is a good thing with Covid-19. Good room size and close proximity to Pavilion wins every time for me. Too many staff to mention individually, but would like to thank the lounge staff in particular. Ameer always remembers my drinks order, no matter the time between stays. Best value hotel in the area!  Look forward to seeing you again soon.",4,0.9672
"I had a really amazing stay at the hotel. When I first arrived I was greeted by Fawwaz, lovely guy, who helped me with my bags and checked me in. He brought up my bags to my room and gave me a room tour. The view was spectacular and thr service provided by the hotel was the best. Room service is always there for me to call at 4am when I'm hungry. By far the best hotel in the area with a good rate. ",5,0.9694
3rd time to visit and very friendly reception. All staff encountered were very helpful. Centrally located close to very large shopping Malls. Spotlessly clean. 18th Floor Club Lounge a haven of peace and quiet which ideal for business discussions.,5,0.945
Once again a great stay since September 2019  This was our 5th stay and the staff were great  Thanks to front desk manager Yuvasunthary and Anna for prompt check in and good room Choice  All staff from door men elevator staff were exceptionally helpful  Highly recommendable due to fantastic position  Will stay again   ,5,0.967
"Good i love the people 5 star. The managers are wonderful especially Yuva, Ann and Fawwaz also Rose the golden lady. Definetely gonna come back here and the room was lovely and beautiful hotel. Strategic location!",5,0.9628
I would like to thank the staff at the Grand millennium club floor they were very helpful and polite especially Ameer and Aiswaria Definitely will come back to this  Hotel when next in Kuala Lumpor great job keep it up,5,0.9509
"Stayed with the family on a short break at the hotel. Love the ambiance of the hotel and the location. Right next door to Pavillion KL mall, just opposite Fahrenheit mall and Lot 10 mall. If you need to some banking transaction, Public Bank is just right next door.  I would like to express my sincere appreciation to the trainee staff (Mr. Wing Hong) who found my mobile phone as I had lost it somewhere in the hotel and Duty Manager (Mr. Badrul). Thank you for the honesty and keep up the great service!",5,0.9661
"Was there for a short break with my husband and 8 months old baby and we definitely love the hotel! Have been to KL for so many times but this is the first time we stayed in Grand Millennium and definitely not the last. We will of course choose to stay here again in the future given the verrryyy good location, which is just next to Pavillion and its' 5 star service!  Hotel is clean, nice and staff are helpful. Their staff is very attentive! Was on our way down in the lift, the staff saw my husband carrying alot of things and immediately he offered to help my husband.   While waiting for our time to leave the hotel, their staff had also offered assistance if we need to take our luggage from the luggage room just by looking at us holding the luggage tag.   Very pleasant experience",5,0.9889
"Hi, the reason for this review is because I was impressed and ultimately happy with the staff in the Club Lounge. Shout out to Razak and Aiswaria for the lovely service and indeed would come back specifically because of you guys!!   However, there's always a bad to a good situation..The guy who was handling the front desk was horrible.Rude and disrespectful. Wish you guys hired anyone else but him",4,0.7866
Loved staying at this hotel. Location is fantastic. Staff were exemplary. Room was top draw. Breakfast for the three days was sumptuous. The swimming pool is a delight along with the spa. It's five mins to the MRT and less to the monorail. If coming from the airport it's much quicker to get the train than a taxi.,5,0.9217
"Very nice hotel especially the location was perfect. Near to some big shopping Mall ie. Pavillion, Fahrenheit, etc, also near to Jl. Alor that having a lot of street food. The hotel room, services and also the ambience was great and very friendly staffs. I would recommend friends to stay at this hotel and also for sure I will come back to this hotel with my family.",4,0.9694
"Great location.  Spacious and bright rooms. Check in was slow.  The first time I walked into the bathroom, I found 2-3 long hair in the bath tub and on the floor (I have short hair), including a couple of tiny pieces of dry trash by the toilet bowl. The second day, the maid did not refill the tissue box and the new towel smelled of cigarette smoke. Breakfast buffet and the coffee breaks were not tasty.  Wifi was free but the connection was not stable. ",3,0.5136
It is very nice hotel and the price not very expensive also the room  very big.  I am very satisfied and happy to stayed in this hotel. The breakfast was amazing and have a lot delicious food to choose and it also good.  And the chef at the egg station was very fast and friendly. I enjoy the breakfast and i want to repeat this beautiful moments.,5,0.9863
"Great location, fairly standard rooms, but service so poor you should just forget about this hotel. If you are used to great service as to be expected of all five-star establishments like the neighbouring Westin, JW Marriott, Ritz Carlton, &amp; Pavilion Hotel, you are not going to find it here. Staff don't appear to like their job much, and handle situations in a templated manner - A is A, B is B. What they are very good at is ensuring they earn every little cent from you. Like how some other reviewers have said, they will at first instance make you upgrade your room to the next category at an additional fee, saying your room is otherwise not ready. Like stopping my pre-schooler son from entering the breakfast area because “he is additional”, and mind you, before they could even",1,0.9745
"Staying here for my wedding anniversary. Was here with my wife (obviously) with my 2 kids. The carpark bit too old due to the old building, maybe.  Checking in was normal, quite smooth. Staff were very friendly.  First, we headed to Bistro 160 for tea where we took set of English tea. Hit and miss on the food but nothing to shout about.  Then, we headed to our room. Surprisingly or unsurprisingly, there's no special arrangement/decoration from the hotel for our anniversary despite has been told up front during the booking. Other hotels would have done a lot on this as during my previous years with others. But, life goes on.  Swimming pool and the gym also quite (if not very) outdated. They should do refurbishment soonest.  And the spa, also a bit of let down as the facilities",4,0.6701
"me and my husband stayed in this hotel few times and we love Grand Millennium KL. Location is very convenient and the foods at Lai Ching Yuen are the top notch! We just keep coming back here because of the food and the excellent service given by their staffs. Thumbs up to Anne Chee, Jack and Ming Keit you guys are amazing! Thank you and we will definitely come back again. ",5,0.9694
"This hotel has a lot going for it. It's got the absolute perfect location next to KL's best Mall, Pavilion. It's on Bukit Bintang street which is lively and filled with shops, cafes, shisha, barbers, pharmacies etc. It""s like a mini Piccadilly Circus.  Also my room, which was club room, was good. Spacious, comfy bed, strong wifi (for multiple devices) and big bathroom.  However there are some major things they need to work on. The hotel has  communication issues. Here are some examples. (1) I phoned the service number and asked them to make sure housekeeping cleaned my room while I was out for 2 hours. However my room was not cleaned when I returned. (2) Before checkout I called reception to have someone come to my room ro help with luggage, but 15 minutes later nobody had come.",3,0.9081
"Perfect location, always stayed here whenever in Kuala Lumpur, so much going on in &amp; around the hotel, friendly staff from front office to housekeeping, reception always helpful with room type requested, always a plus if you know your rooms in the hotel, another reason why i always stay here,  only wish i could stay longer.",5,0.9081
" I booked here for one nights stay and my room was on level 18. The hotel is located directly opposite the Fahrenheit 88, about 100 metres down the road is the Pavilion shopping centre with many, many other eateries, bars and other local shops.   I've stayed at the twin towers before which was great in its own right, but me. The location of the Grand Millennium was great.   I would stay again, suggest you try also. ",5,0.9217
"Very good location next to the shopping malls and lots of eateries. Rooms are good size, swimming pool is a bit old and noisy (probably the compressors of the air conditioning making that noise, quit annoying really). Breakfast is ok, would recommend their Friday night international buffet- good choice of food and deserts choice is amazing ",4,0.9284
First time staying here. Preview rooms prior to staying as quiet room location important for sleeping. Jennifer Chau kindly showed me room selection at back of hotel which was selected for this stay. For people who know Kuala Lumpur this hotel is right next door to Pavilion shopping mall. Plenty of shopping and dining experience around. Stayed in suite at back of hotel. Separate living area for work and relaxation. Large bath for people who enjoy soaking in tub. Club lounge great views on high floor. Nice chilled white wine selection. Great vegetarian options for breakfast and evening cocktails.  Love fresh guava juice. Special commendation to Razak and Sabree for assistance in lounge. Didn't have time for pool this trip but could see large landscape area was enjoyed by other,5,0.9655
"The third time staying over here, never tried staying any lower than club room, everything is fine, check in is a breeze as usual, receptionist will escort club guest to executive floor for check in procedure, fast and efficient check in, varities of the cocktail hour is good, breakfast in the club floor is ok, housekeeping were punctual, heading back to my room right after my breakfast the room was all cleaned up and tidy, club floor ambassador Mr.Ameer and Ms.Hanim took care of me well, and handle my check out well, request for late check out granted, will be back soon.",5,0.9313
"Just had a great stay at the Grand Millennium in KL. Lovely room, great staff. Excellent food in the business lounge from Chef Shafiq and charming service from Aiswaria and Sabree. Thank you all for an enjoyable stay.",5,0.9816
"This is a large clean hotel in a central location. It is well located next to a large mall with many restaurants. We walked to the towers and park. Best way to do this is through the back of the mall next to the hotel via the elevated walk ways. This was safe and a good way to escape the heat.  The hotel staff are friendly and the rooms are large, modern and clean.  My only criticism of the hotel is the lift doors shut way too quick. They are forever shutting on people. This was a worry when travelling with young children. It presents a risk of the group being separated. ",4,0.926
"This was second time staying at this hotel .i stayed for 7 days , first couple of days was a absolute night mare with the next door neighbour and opposite room was partying until around 3:30 am in morning. I called the reception to complain they said some one will come and have a look but nothing was done. I thought it was a one off but it happened again next day, I finished work and talked to the reception who said there are no available rooms to shift me. Then I spoke to a elderly gentleman who guess was a seniors manager who kindly apologised and moved me to a room on different floor . I suppose this can happen in any hotel. Apart from this overall a good stay.",3,0.7906
Great location close to shopping and restaurants.  Personable and helpful staff.  Clean room with nice assortment of amenities and efficient/friendly housekeeping.  Several on-site restaurant choices.  We will definitely return.  ,5,0.9337
"I made a reservation for non-smoking floor with king size bed. A VERY SIMPLE request. However, at 4pm it wasn't ready yet, and a lady at the front desk by the name of ROSE just told me that I have to come back FEW hours later since it is not ready. Don't even have the courtesy to say sorry or give a specific time to be back. And when I asked her to check with the cleaner service , she was avoiding to  do it and ask me to come back later. Few minutes later, she was checking in with the cleaner for another customer. Not sure what contribute to her biased treatment!",1,0.5315
"I came with my family we booked two rooms  The hotel looks like 5 starts hotel  But it's old and the rooms really old  1/ Hot water colored yellow , 2/ no lights on bathroom 3. I needed to call everyday to ask for towels and the towels smelled really bad ,  If I came back to KL I would definitely stay at other hotel , only the location is good ",2,0.2748
"Nice 5-star hotel next to Pavilions in Bukit Bintang. Ideally located for shopping and MRT system. Hotel is clean and in good state of repair, with spacious and bright rooms WiFi is free but was not so good, with intermittent outages requiring re-login. Breakfast buffet was adequate but staff struggled to cope with number of guests, so some long queues for some of the stations  ...eggs, tea/coffee, toast/bread...could improve efficiency in these areas ",4,0.9604
I truly enjoyed my stay in this hotel. Great hospitality service by Ms Aiswaria. The breakfast in the club lounge was super delicious by Mr Syafiq .Thanks to serve us better than before. Highly recomended and I look forward to staying here again.,5,0.9741
"Regularly stay in this hotel and it's always an enjoyable break.  The business lounge is well worth a visit and great service by Aiswaria, Sabree, Razak . We will recommend to our friends and family. Good job. ",5,0.9552
"I have always wanted to stay at this hotel, but room rates were high. However, during our last visit to KL we found out it was on sale so we grabbed the chance. My daughter and I are so happy that we decided to stay here.  The staff were accommodating and friendly, the beds &amp; pillows so comfy (I wish I asked if I can buy or where to buy their pillows), the breakfast choices were good and filling, and the location very accessible to shopping. We will definitely stay here again next time, if we can get the same or better room rates. ",4,0.9843
"The location of hotel is very good with most of popular mall and locations around. However the road leading to hotel have little bit of traffic jam. The rooms are well appointed , the staff is courteous and quite helpful. Had booked for 3 nights on a business trip.",4,0.9295
"Loved the location, simply the best.  Cleanliness in the room could be bit more BUT very very happy with everything.  Service 5star.   Forgot my phone in breakfast room and when realised ran back to the restaurant in the hotel. They had in safely secured in the drawer and gave it to me straightaway. ",4,0.9628

"I am one of your a-la-carte member.  Past stay experience with this Hotel was fine.  But this time the bathroom facilities need improvement, such as the shower water flow was slow, toilet cover with rough surface that needs replacement and one of the bath towels provided was smelly even though it looked clear.",3,0.7506
"A very pleasant stay in central Kuala Lumpur. Whenever you need some peace and quit from the buzz of the city, you should go to the Lounge and experience the excellent service and kindness from Aiswaria, Hanim, Hafiza, Sabree, Ameer and Zara.

"Grand Milennium is located in the heart of Kuala Lumpur right next to Pavilion. Which make it fantastic for people whom love to shop. However, the traffic is terrible, we arrived from the airport at 10pm and took 15mins to get from the far end of Pavilion to the hotel. The breakfast buffet had lots of variety and the services is fantastic. The room is slightly out of date and with use a refurbishment.",4,0.9062

"This was our 3rd time staying in this hotel. We like it. The location is perfect and it's a very good hotel. The only things that I didn't like were that they need to clean under the bed (lots of other 5 star hotels have the same problem), I noticed that last year when my child threw his toy and I needed to bring it from under the bed. This year I saw lots of dirt in the ceiling in the gap between the gypsum and the wall. This could be cleaned and also the glass of the windows needs to be cleaned. I also prefer if the bathroom had hand Bidet sprayer instead of the one inside the toilet. Other than that everything else was very good, especially the staff.",4,0.9558
"I love Malaysia. Spent my new year at this hotel and was well take care of. The rooms are spacious and clean, however thought that the bathroom could be better, it was a little dated.  The staff are friendly and helpful. Check in took awhile could have been quicker. Overall it was a ok stay. Will return. ",4,0.9694
The location is good but would prefer Pavillion Hotel if its for shopping trip... I was told the room is with King size bed but ended up with queen size bed though double confirmed with the check-in staff. The buffet breakfast is not as good as before...,3,0.7003
"The location and facilities of the hotel are excellent. However, it takes a very long time to check in and its a shame that the club lounge does not allow children.  As a result we were unable to use it (unusual as many other hotels accomodate).  ",4,-0.017
"Grand Millennium hotel has been my first and only choice although there many surrounding hotel. It was definitely value for money for business and holiday travellers. Hotel quality of service and cleanliness were good. Breakfast varieties was acceptable although not fantastic. Overall, I highly recommended GMKL to travellers, a great location.",5,0.9536
Very good location within minutes accessibility to F&amp;B and shopping malls. Would definitely recommend to families and friends.  Good hotel amenities and room is of good size for a family of 3. However hotel restaurant food not worth the amount paid,4,0.9425
The reception gave us a smoker room which is not good for family.  Room are not ready even we came late at 4.00pm and we have email them about our arrival.  We got a clean room after few hours.  Breakfast is good. ,3,-0.4976
"Loved the location and the pool was splendid. Size of the room also pretty good and overall personnel was friendly but some just gave you the feeling that everything was just too much.  Mildew in the shower an the bathroom in a 5* hotel? Really? Also the minibar was not emptied out from the previous guest. A lot of bad or not existing maintenance of stuff. My husband made the joke : The hotel is called Millennium cause that is when it had the last update in style and maintenance. He wasn't that far off... But the worst is the breakfast.... Not the food itself, although not extreme good quality, but the feeding frenzy of 200 people. Every morning just looked like war just broke out and people were grabbing what they could. Shoving and pushing; yelling at the cooks for not making",3,-0.6523
"I stayed with my partner over the New Year Period in a club room. We have been to K.L. many times and for this stay we wanted a central hotel with all the amenities. The location of the hotel was perfect. The amenities including the pool although slightly dated matched our expectations. We paid extra for the Club Room. Unfortunately the service in the lounge was well below par. Almost Faulty Towers like. Staff rarely there when you needed them, 20min waits for tea,wrong meals delivered &amp; one staff person always wandering around with food or drinks looking for the correct table.The cocktail hour was particularly poor with a chaotic feel. Late comers encountered uncleared tables. Children under 12yrs were consistently allowed in despite the rules saying otherwise and spent much",3,-0.4985
The hotel was very central and well located. Staff were less attentive than expected; I've stayed at other Grand Millennium hotels. Really disappointed that my birthday was forgotten and no cake or card were sent to my room.,4,-0.2799
"Visited kuala Lumpur in Dec 2019 with family stayed here at Grand Mellinium.  It's one of the first five star hotels in Kuala Lumpur.  I believe it's almost 30years old. Still look grand but rooms especially bathroom dated. Need upgrading. A lot dust on furniture.  Not attention to detail. But service from staff was very good.  Staff from all departments such as reception,  concierge,  restaurant,  pool etc were very helpful and friendly.",3,0.9526
"It was a marvelous stay @ the hotel thanks to a staff like Aiswaria &amp; gabriel. They made my stay so enjoyable , by their profesional treatment.

Just returned from another trip to Grand millenium in Kuala Lumpur (dec 9 - 19)  I have been there over 10 times and always love absolutely everything about the hotel.  Upon arrival most staff recognise my family and I and greet us by our names.  The location is amazing and centrally located.  A very big thank you to Zul Edaham the bell captain who always helps in every way possible and ensures the kids are always happy. I feel he can answer absolutely any question we ask him and always suggests the most appropriate answer for us. Even my kids love coming down to the lobby to see Zul and have a chat to him.  Badrul and Anna from front office always ensure every detail of the booking is looked after and any issues are dealt with instantly. We were lucky enough to receive a points,5,0.985
"We have stayed there in the past and it used to be a good hotel , the position is excellent but definitely not up to standard of a 5 star hotel. The lounge selection is very poor and not enough staff to address the guests. One poor girl had to run around trying to help everyone. We had to constantly ask for a bottle of water as the fridges were turned off and they only displayed 2-3 cans  in each fridge. We had an upgrade to a suite not a great standard , even though I asked to correspond with the general manager, I only had access to his associate. I got charged the wrong figure when checking out and had to go back and fourth to prove the rate I booked the room on. Overall not the experience I expected to celebrate an anniversary. ",3,-0.6726

Room are a bit dated and need improvement as there are some plugs not working and the pressure for eco-washer in bathroom not so great.  Food in the Club lounge and room service was good and decent choices, however the beverages price for room service I think a bit pricey.  Highlight from my stay were the excellent service from the club lounge team. Hafiza,Amir and the rest of the Club team really took the effort to impress the guest with their delightful hospitality which make my stay great. Kudos to them.  Definitely will be return in near future.",4,0.9905
Hotel is running high occupancy because of its reasonable room rate for the location. However be prepared to queue at check in counters and bfast lounge.

"Horrible Horrible Horrible!!! On holiday with family and planned for a 3 nights stay at the so called ""Grand Millennium Kuala Lumpur"". Advance booking was made well in in advance and payment fully made for the stay. On booking, the wife wrote an email to make the necessary request for connecting rooms and such, as we have 4 kids. Check in time as with most hotels is at 3pm. As we were making our way to the hotel at close to 4pm, the wifey made a call an hour prior to our arrival, just to make sure all was good. The reservation desk that answered the call acknowledged all that was said for the most part but only to say that the front desk will have to approve and initiate the necessary. So, we requested to have our call transferred to the front desk, only to have the call",1,0.3105

In the afternoon prior to our arrival, my wife got a call from the hotel representative to confirm our arrival so that the hotel could prepare the rooms.  We arrived at the hotel at 8:00 PM straight from the KLIA, but upon checking in at the counter, we were told rooms were not ready!  I considered this a scam by the management, since the check-in as advertised was 3:00 PM and after 5 hours past the check-in time, the rooms were not ready!

The room is showing its age and I suggest the management look into renovating the rooms. The aircon thermostat was not working so you either have a freezing room or a room with stale air if you turn off the aircon. Service was average for a 5 star hotel. Most staff members can hardly afford a smile. The only one who could afford one was our housekeeper.    We had buffet dinner at the mill on 21 Dec and found worms in the oysters.

"This is undoubtedly a great hotel with many excellent features but what makes it truly special is the wonderful staff. They are so helpful and caring.  Many reviewers, myself included, like to say they would return. And in this case we have. We structured our trip to include a stay in the superb city of KL and staying once more at the Grand Millennium. Thank you again! Oh, and we loved the Christmas decorations!",5,0.9947
The location is very good near mall and many restaurant near there. The receptionist is good and friendly. Room is big and have bathtub at bathroom but the cleanliness must improved many dust and the towel is old and not clean.,4,0.7619

"We stayed in a executive suite with access to Club Lounge. We received a very warm welcome and we were treated with high respect and friendliness. When we checked in, we informed the manager that our son had Autism and might access Club Lounge with his support worker at times and all the staff accommodated to ensure my son felt at ease and he was treated with care.  My son was sick and could not have breakfast at the lounge so the staff had his breakfast delivered to the room. We had stayed in many 5 star hotels around the world but we have never received such excellent customer service.  We will continue to stay at this hotel in the future.",5,0.6296
"I was there with 5 of my colleague and we spend two weeks in this hotel, The first day we have a miss understanding with the front office and koko came out and solve it very smoothly It was during that time xmas song all over the hôtel very nice decoration a great guy in charge of the bar and they have a MVP called KOKO he was so caring and he help us a lot can't find my word to say thank you.

"GMKL location is in an ideal location with many shopping malls and restaurants being about 2 minutes on foot away from the Hotel. The Hotel is also close to the GOKL free bus service and the KL Monorail station. The MRT underground train station is close to the hotel too.   The staff at the Hotel were very nice. This includes Reception, Concierge, room cleanup crew and breakfast area staff. My room was a good size room overlooking the city, with full length windows providing nice view of the city, including the PNB118 building which is under construction and will be the tallest building in KL once construction is completed. The bathroom was of good size and had a shower as well as a bathtub with decent toiletries and towels. The room also came with an iron and an ironing board.",5,0.9627
"The location was very good allowing ease of travel to Pavilion and Petronas towers shopping and eating precincts. We booked a room within meters of the spacious and luxurious Club room and enjoyed cocktails, wines and beers and a variety of tasty morsels during the generous two hour cocktail period.    Rajak and Ameer provided a wonderful service and nothing was too much trouble. After a late evening walk in the city we could return to the Club and be treated to a lovely latte or flat white - whatever we wished. The view was enticing and the pond a delightful backdrop.  Breakfast was varied and the chef cooked delightful eggs of all types including Benedict, scrambled, poached etc upon request.  We were well looked after by the effervescent Hafiza and Hanim who, along with Rajak",4,0.98
"I book the club room which is value for money, on top Hafiza and his friends from the lounge was very helpful.  A great thanks to the team who look after me well during my stay there. Also the facilities at the hotel was great since it has its own prayer room, the pool also was nice. All the major shopping Mall is within walking distance. THANK YOU.",4,0.9825
"Zulkarnain the doorman always provides exceptional and we'll informed advise on things to-do and what to look out for, he goes above and beyond to assist where he can. His mannerisms fully represents the character he is, he is not only an asset to any employer he works for, but also a great ambassador to the grand Millennium group.   Nurien the restaurant manager is a lovely and we'll informed person, she is very knowledgeable and accommodating to patrons needs. Highly regarded person, her management style clearly shows she is highly regarded and has her team working to there full potential.   Anne front office manager was very accommodating, we requested to stay in same room that was originally provided, not only did she accommodate the request she was of did so with great",5,0.9788
"Excellent location, right next to the Pavilion Shopping Centre and in front of Fahrenheit Shopping Centre. The lobby was all set up for Christmas and looked stunning!  Unfortunately that's the only good thing I have to say about this hotel. The rooms were average sized and views okay. The service was not great, we emailed approximately two weeks in advance with a request of two adjoining (or nearby) rooms. We arrived at 3pm (check-in time) and had to wait two hours to get to our room. They placed us in a smokers room (apparently at our request - we had two asthmatics travelling with us). This dragged on for two hours with them saying that they wouldnt be able to accommodate our request despite having booked months in advance and having our request organised a couple of weeks in",2,0.6806
Great stay Nice welcome Huge selection of various food for breakfast Great location down town in front of the Pavillion Mall and to walking distance of streets with restaurants (diner in the street to discover local delicacies),5,0.946
"Stay in this hotel if you are looking for a conveneient and handy place to stay in KL.  It is surrounded by major shopping malls and resturants.  Transportation is easy.  The room was generally clean.  Other than these, service and food were so-so.  One of the reception staff, a male, was not very helpful.  It is also unfortuante that the underground link to the Farenheit Mall across the road was permanent,ly closed for unknown reasons.  Another observation was that a few shemales were pestering guests walking back from the shops every evening.",4,0.468
"Grand Millenniun hotel has been my favourite hotel in term of value for money, good quality breakfast, of course high cleanliness of room and within hotel areas. Room rate was extremely reasonable for a 5-star hotel with great location, next to it is Pavillion Mall, all top Brand's of goods are available, except for enough money to spend. At Pavillion connection along the side, a host of bars and cafe are there to make the evening more merrier. Weissbrau is a great German pub serving Erdinger beer with pork knuckles and sausages, Spanish baby back and more. A great hotel to stay, never be disappointed.",5,0.9797
"We thought the location was great, service personal where average, the room did not appear to be the 40sq m as per the information and the winfdows where extremely dirty, after complaining to the service manager who seemed to not belive us , but had to check herself, then we where givin another room , breakfast was good but your staff where very lethargic as for 5 star rating we think that it should be only 4 star at best",3,0.8091
This place is hands down one of the best hotels I have been to. The staff are super friendly from the minute we were dropped off by the taxi. We were well received by one Nasir very nice guy. At the reception the check in was so seamless and before I forget the lobby is a sight to behold. We used to have breakfast at the lounge and it was there that we met the nicest lady called Aiswaria who used to serve us in the company of Ann and Razak. Hands down best service.  I don't know what more to say but my stay there was beyond compare and would highly recommend. The fact that it's next to Pavillion (biggest mall) just the cherry on the cake.,5,0.9407
"Stayed at the Club Room for three nights. In general, great service by staff and those on duty at the club lounge.   But, it seems if you are late for breakfast, you might have to pick up the scraps. Arrived at 9.30 am on the last day, the food wasn't refilled and and there were empty food trays lying around.   Then, staff who check the guests in were not consistent in their messaging. Was told as club members, there was the option to have breakfast at the lounge or to go to the restaurant downstairs as it offered a wider variety of food. But on checking out, was told club members should have breakfast only at the lounge.  When checking out, was given the bill with charges for ""snacks"" at the restaurant downstairs when this was not the case. What was really surprising, the hotel",4,0.0498

"We stayed a night here because of a wedding ceremony. The location of the hotel is very good, it is near to pavilion, Fahrenheit, Starhill Gallery and a 10-15 minutes linked bridge walk to KLCC.  There are a lot of eateries nearby, transportation is very convenient too.  The hotel is usually very full during weekend due to its location.   However the hotel is very old and need maintainable. The lobby has several step of staircase make bringing up luggage difficult although the staff will help us. And the lighting is dark, no matter how grand the renovation is, they look dull.   The isle of the hotel rooms are dark too, it makes me feel gloomy, but not scary in that sense.   The room needs upgrade definitely. Some of the taps are loosen, the shower head is dirty, and the water",3,0.5702
"its a very quiet hotel, premium location .. near all required facilities.  very professional staff .. I stayed at the club floor and the staff were very friendly and helping the guests.. I remember two names Aiswaria she was friendly also Razak.  Price should be reconsidered by the hotel management.",5,0.8573
"I stayed since 2 weeks at this wonderful hotel, Ms Ann, Ms Aiswaria, Mr Sabree were impressed me by the service in club lounge. The club lounge outside area the landscape were great. Great for business and meeting purpose. Highly recommend this hotel for my friend and family.",5,0.9708
"Stayed in Grand Milennium for a few nights again travelling through the Country. Hotel is in a great location for food, shopping and nightlife. Used the club lounge facilities - well worth the extra. Really enjoy the lounge for breakfast and evening social - staff lovely, attentive and courteous. Special mention to Aiswaria working in the 18th floor lounge who went above and beyond.",5,0.9732
Tip top hospitality. Nice and gorgeous employee especially Aiswaria Ann.Very kind and sweet. Never disappoint in term of services always there to serve. I give 5 star for this and Will come back again sooner.,5,0.9479

"We love the facility of this hotel and the staff of this hotel was very friendly, especially the duty manager Mr.Haritz, and the location is amazing, everything is around you, breakfast is good and quality of service also excellent.",5,0.9589
"Whenever travelling to KL or stopping over on a trip back home we always pick the Grand Millennium as a great place to stay.  The hotel offers great ""club room deals"" which give you a few extra perks for not much more than a regular room.  Club rooms are very spacious, service great and if you chose to take breakfast in the club that is great too, but you do have the choice to eat in the main restaurant as well.  Happy hour drinks each evening in the club with tasty snacks which are almost meals doesn't leave you wondering what to do for dinner, and if this means more time for shopping then you have plenty of choices within minutes of your location. Looking forward to staying again when we next travel through.",5,0.9547

"Although the check in was a bit slower than expected, the room was acceptable. Great location - walkable distance to many malls and eateries. Did not get the upgrade offer, but the price was reasonable. They were preparing the Xmas decor and some minor maintenance, hence I will not comment on that part. Breakfast could still do with some nice varieties, then it could be because we stay during the early week (menu might change slightly the next week).  Housekeeping was just an ok.  Unless you're walking and taking the MRT/LRT - do expect long time in traffic at times.",4,0.8658
"First time in this hotel. Very convenient location. Got a very warm welcome upon check in by Mei Ling and Zara. Rooms were big and refurbished overlooking Bukit Bintang. The only thing when we were in the lift and coincidence the staff(Rizal) were in the same lift he just ignored us without greeting or even a smile to acknowledge. Same goes to the Porter team when delivering luggages. Management has to train all staff to greet/break some rapport to their guests be it in the lift, floor or lobby. Overall, it was a good short stay. I will be back again in the future and looking forward to see you again Mei Ling.",4,0.757
"This is a very nice hotel, all staff very friendly. Had the luxury of staying in a club room with club lounge access, which was fabulous, lovely food and drinks. Thankyou to Aiswaria and Ameer for your attentiveness. Fantastic location being right next door to Pavillion shopping centre on Bukit Bintang",5,0.9544
Had an awful experience in the food quality during breakfast especially for vegetarians.  It was placed with other non veg items and some people were seen using the same spoons which is offensive to Hindu Vegetarians.  Hotel should accommodate separate counter for vegetarians and improve the quality of food especially the Indian vegetarian items.,3,-0.4767
I really enjoyed my stay at Grand Millinium and this is my first experience in this hotel. Super close to pavilion. Excellent customer service by Aiswarai and Rasak. I will definitely stay in this hotel again.  The management provide great course and i realized this by the excellent service of Aiswarai and Rasak. Good job guys.,5,0.981

The hotel have a great location, and the Club Floor are a nice relaxing area after a long day at job. The personnel are always very helpful and service minded.

"My husband and I planned for a short getaway in Bukit Bintang for our wedding anniversary and we chose to stay at Grand Millenium as the price is quite reasonable and we love how close it is to Pavilion Mall. We were happy with our choice. This hotel is not new but still in great condition. It doesn't look rundown. The exclusiveness is still there and the room is clean, modern looking and comfortable. All are great except for the pathway from parking lot to lobby which is not really convenient (lots of stairs making it hard to walk with luggage). My advice is to just drop all your luggage at the front lobby and let the staff take care of it while you park your car. ",4,0.9828

The pool area is large and the gym is well stocked. The Club Lounge is excellent! Fantastic breakfast and evening buffet with pretty much every drink you could ask for. And to top it off all of the hotel staff are great and nothing is too much trouble. In particular Aiswaria in the club lounge. A big thank you and see you again soon.",5,0.9701
"Over the years we have stayed here many times,which is recommendation enough!  We hadn't been to Malaysia for nearly 3 years due to ill health, so imagine our delight on entering the club lounge and being recognised by the wonderful young man who sadly I dont remember his name but who has worked there several years.Quite a feat when you consider how many guests pass through!  We were impressed also by Aiswaria and Rasak who we hadn't met before but who were so attentive and charming, indeed everything that typifies The Grand Millennium service.  If I had to be slightly negative I would say the windows were green in places which I have never seen before, and things are, in parts becoming slightly tired. However it wont stop us returning!",5,0.9014
"I'll keep it simple without exaggeration  ** Location: 10/10 Because of two things: 1- Its in Bukit Bintang Street ( called arab street ) its good street for walking, day or night, even at night some stores keep open few hours more, also many restaurants there and coffee shops. 2- its Very close to Pavilion mall ( Biggest mall ) 2 mins walks, also close to Fahrenheit88 mall and lot10, But i recommend Pavilion mall its much bigger and has everything you need.  ** Rooms: I recommend Club rooms wich has access to Club lounge opens from 8:00-20:00, its small quiet nice lounge, has it own reception for check-in and check-out, free coffee and biscuits there, and free cocktails from 18:00-20:00 means free food drinks etc.. sometimes its raining outside so its nice to relax there for an",5,0.9758
"We booked our special anniversary trip away via Expedia and were disappointed when the hotel did not respond to our multiple messages sent by Expedia advising of dietary requirements and the special celebrations for our trip .  During check in I mentioned the message and I was advised they had received and it had been noted. But no apology for non response which was further compounded when we arrived at breakfast and requested gluten free options ...staff were unaware of our requirements.   Breakfast was full of sugary pastries and cake options. We struggled to find very few healthy/gluten free options. When we requested gluten-free bread we had to wait as they didn't have any prepared....the sand issue occurred day 2, it was only day 3 that we were asked how much longer we were",3,0.5719
"Had a 2 night stay at Grand Millennium Kuala Lumpur. It's a old hotel, the lobby ambience is still OK but the room is due for refurbish.  The hotel staff is friendly and helpful. Very customer service oriented atitutde. Surprising the hotel served great quality food. Had ala carte dim sum buffet at their Chinese restaurant and lunch at their buffet line restaurant located 2nd floor.  The hotel location is superb. On the left is Pavilion (one of the biggest and luxury shopping mall in Bukit Bintang). Across the street is Fahrenheit shopping mall. Further down is Lot 10 shopping mall. Alot of restaurant and massage shop. One down side about this location is that the traffic is very bad and heavy.  Oevrall, it was a OK stay. Will consider to revisit again. ",4,0.9768
