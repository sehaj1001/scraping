"I, my brother and sister stayed at the Mandarin Oriental, Kuala Lumpur last month (Feb '20).  They checked our temperatures at check-in (front door) --- that was great as COVID-19 was just being discussed.  Hand sanitizer was everywhere, nice!  The hotel was fabulous, but it was the staff that I can't say enough nice things about.  The concierge was most helpful, and Club Supervisor, Razman Khailani, was just a marvelous, helpful person -- great man!  Just please -- keep the ""made to order"" pasta for lunch at the Club, it was great.  When I come back to KL, I will always stay at the Mandarin Oriental.  Thanks again for a great time!",5,0.9948
"Have stayed at MOKL twice. Last time the king room with twin towers view was better as we were on the 21 fl. This time they only had 10 fl room, where the view of the towers was harder to see.  That was ok as the hotel did seem full (at the end of raya season?) We ate at the buffet in Mosaic on Sat evening. As per usual the food was excellent but the service even better. Saiful our waiter was perfect. He was patient, soft spoken but attentive (not the typical style for a buffet atmosphere but at the MO this is what you get) Jeff the desert chef (manning the counter) also exemplified MO service. He was always smiling and never seemed to  waver at all the guests demands.  The next day we needed to get some formal batik shirts and Aaron at concierge arranged for a car to take us",5,0.9571
Super service from arrival to departure . A great hotel with very good restaurants . Very friendly and caring staff. Helped with my handicapped husband.  Located in a quiet part of town Close to sightseeing ,5,0.9593
"Without a doubt, Mandarin Oriental Kuala Lumpur has exceeded my expectations of hospitality especially in these turbulent times. Commendable service excellence from the moment we stepped into the hotel till we checked out. Special thanks to the superb staff mentioned below who made our stay extra special. Ms Ros from front desk reception who welcomed us, made our checkin a breeze &amp; even inducted us into the Fans of Mandarin Oriental program for ease of future bookings. Mr Desmond and Ms Paula who liaised with our concierge from privateupgrades.com, gifted us a complimentary double upgrade from a deluxe room to a twintower-facing Park Suite and provided us a welcome tour of our suite. Truly love the complimentary breakfast spread especially the steak and eggs. Kudos for even",5,0.991
"One of the best hotels in KL that you must try. Excellent service, luxury environment, great coffee, lovely staff. I love everything about this hotel. The location is very strategic near to the Petronas Twin Towers -  great view and easy to find restaurant. I will definitely visit this hotel again.",5,0.9844
"Lovely staff, good location, okay view, typical Mandarin Oriental hospitality. The room was a little dated but still doable, as Mandarin Oriental is like this too. Loved the swimming pool and restaurant! IN NEED OF RENOVATIONS",4,0.9286
"There are many luxury hotels in KL, but the Mandarin Oriental commits itself to providing stellar customer service.  Everyone you meet goes beyond what is expected and delivers an extraordinary experience.   I did not meet anyone working at this hotel who did not go out of his or her way to make me feel at home; however, since I always stay on the Club Level, I have to rave about the staff and especially Mr. Razman.   Club levels are always nice, but Mr. Razman made me feel that I was entering his home as an invited guest, and he wanted to make sure that I felt welcome.  He always made me smile, and I complement the hotel for employing such a wonderful team.   The Club Level is located on the 24th floor with magnificent views, including the Petronas  Towers.  On the surface it's",5,0.9787
"Gives the best in first impression. Very welcoming the moment we stepped in. However the check-in process was quite slow, took awhile. But our baggages were already in the room when open the door, very efficient. The room was very nice and pleasant. Housekeeping service tip top. The executive lounge at level 24 was excellent. Staff very friendly and helpful. Just 2min walk away to the KLCC shopping mall. Our stay was very enjoyable. Keep it up.",5,0.9865
We came here for 1 night during our honeymoon excursion and it was amazing. The staff was so friendly and hospitable. We stayed in the executive suite with the park view and it was such a nice view! I'm sure the city view is also amazing. They decorated our room with a swan towel on our bed and flower petals. Overall the stay was so great and the food in the club lounge also very nice! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!,5,0.9842
"I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental Kuala Lumpur (MOKUL) on a trip to Southeast Asia. My friend and I used MOKUL/Kuala Lumpur as our home base as we took flights between Taiwan and Cambodia and stopped back at KL between each visit.  We stayed a total of seven nights over three stays and were totally impressed by the service at the hotel, the amenities and their attention to detail. The property itself is gorgeous and very well kept. Everything is beyond clean and well maintained. The customer experience with the staff was top notch with friendly and hospitable service throughout our stays at every turn: check in, housekeeping, breakfast, and poolside.  We booked lower tier rooms, but even these were worthy of five stars. Little things that other hotels overlook are attended to at",5,0.9237
"I stayed in the MO in KL last week. Difficult times given the present coronavirus situation. However, the hotel and its staff went about their business in the usual professional way. Including a real concern for each of our health. Temperature checks, sanitizer  everywhere and handing out masks, etc for those in need. Thank you MO for a wonderful stay.",5,0.5719
"First impressions were amazing; bellboys spring into action to help with luggage, grand entrance hall and fast &amp; friendly service from front desk. As we were traveling on business we had options of 2 upgrades; choice of spa credit, breakfast, early check in, treat in room etc. We chose late check out (4pm) as we have 2am flight home and room upgrade - from city view to park view. Staff were so friendly and helpful with my request for hypoallergenic bedding, as they usually offer goose down pillows.  We were offered orange flavoured water as we checked in. We had to pay a largish bond on our credit card, nearly £100 I think. We were also given complimentary drinks vouchers, 1 per room but there were 2 of us in our room?! Temperature checks prior to check in and hand sanitizer at",5,0.9624
"Staff are amazing and make the stay feel like home away from home.  Excellent location with great rooms, beds and AC, making the stay very comfortable.  Definitely make this a top choice when staying in KL.",5,0.9701
"We had a nice visit in the hotel.  We enjoyed different restaurants, spa massage and facial.  I enjoyed this stay because the staff are so helpful and always carried a smile.  Thanks to the hotel duty manager, izina in spa treatment, Megan, Italian restaurant staff, my family and I enjoyed so much and sure we will come again in the future!!!",5,0.9755
"Even only 1 night for the quick travel, I felt peace, comfortable, and relaxed atmosphere. Thank you as always, Mandarin oriental. On my next trip, I will try the swimming pool with a gorgeous view of the park.",5,0.9477
"We stayed 6 nights and had a really good experience, our room was lovely, spacious and kept very clean. The pool and outside area are lovely, well kept and the pool/bar staff were super efficient and friendly. Happy hour in the pool bar makes the drinks good value and again the fact that the staff are so friendly makes for a lovely place to sit and enjoy a glass of wine (or 3!) The food at the pool bar was also excellent. The location for getting around KL is great, plenty of good restaurants close by.",5,0.9952
"We stayed 2 nights in the hotel and the friendliness of the people and the service have been so great! A super nice experience was our visit in the Chinese restaurant of the hotel where we had a first class service and food with great explanations about Chinese food in Malaysia and a tea tasting. The first orientation at the breakfast buffet took us 10 minutes, it is soo impressive how many food from different cultures you could get. Not to forget the cleanliness and the service in the room. If we are in Kuala Lumpur again we will book Mandarin oriental for sure",5,0.9823
"We had very high hopes for the Mandarin having selected it carefully for our anniversary stay. However, those expectations were surpassed.    The hotel is fabulous. It’s been designed with great taste. You feel you’re somewhere very special and all the amenities are top drawer.   The pool area is perfect with very attentive staff. The gym is great (we loved our yoga session with Grace). Breakfast is also excellent (so much choice).  However, the stars of the show are the staff. Faultless service from everyone. Too many to name but thank you to Mohanna (for checking us in and out) and Janet and Asri for looking after us in the bar area in the evenings.  The whole team were brilliant. We’ll be back.   If you’re in KL, stay here - you will not regret it.",5,0.9828
"One of the nicest, most luxurious and beautiful hotels I’ve stayed at. Service was excellent! People are super nice. Amenities are great. Love the pool! We would definitely stay here again and look for the MO brand in other countries. ",5,0.9839
"This was an interesting experience - liked the oriental decor and nice rooms. Great amenities such as pool area etc, though staff were a little careless, and lacked real warmth. Breakfast lacked the authentic Malaysian touch and taste, the staff again looked uninterested!!! The Kyo club was a little toxic with all the smoking; shame it's an extension of Mandarin....",4,0.8994
"Stayed at this hotel for one night and we enjoyed our short stay. A quality hotel, with nice rooms and polite and efficient staff. The fitness center was one of the best you are going to find in any hotel. Food at the hotel was reasonably priced and the location was great, as you are only about 3 minutes away from the Petronas Towers and a very nice mall with lots of restaurant choices. The breakfast buffet was also very good with a large selection of food choices. I wasn't impressed by the city, but if you are going to visit Kuala Lumpur, this is a great place to stay.",4,0.9553
"Location: Excellent, pretty much attached to the Petronas Towers, shopping centre and park. Service: 6 star! You are greeted with a smile everywhere and there are so many staff willing to help. The pool attendants were amazing, so friendly and kept topping up our water on a day where the temperature reached 36 degrees.  Room: had a tower view room which was amazing. Room was spotless and cleaned more than once a day! Bed was the most comfortable of our 7 hotels during our trip. If it could steal a bed...i would have! Swimming Pool: amazing. Infinity pool overlooking the park. Great size and never felt busy, Area around pool was excellent and food at the bar class. Restaurants: We only ate at Mosiac which is where you also have breakfast, The food was excellent and although",5,0.9922
"I have been in Kuala Lumpur three times. All my stay was at Mandarin Oriental. There are several reasons for choosing this Hotel. The location is next to the PETRONAS towers, KLLC Surria mall, and the fountain. The service, the buffet breakfast, and facilities were suburb. I loved the recreational area. That hotel is my favorite Hotel.",5,0.7845
"Writing this review sitting by the impressive MO pool overlooking KLCC park. We have enjoyed every aspect of our stay.   The facilities are a real highlight. With a full-scale gym, indoor golf, table tennis, pool and two tennis courts (big thanks to Chris, the resident coach for giving me a few games) the MO feels like a beach resort in the city.  Every aspect of service, poolside, at reception or at meals has been exceptional. Our thanks to the team.",5,0.9565
"I stayed for 3 days in this hotel one of my favorites located in the heart of the city of Kuala Lumpur, the service was extremely good. the food was nice.  I will recommend it to my friends and colleagues for sure👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻",4,0.9245
It is the Hotel staff which makes this Hotel so special - I come here once a year - and this for a reason. People are extremely friendly - especially Tajun from the pool deck is incredible. Looking forward to my next stay,5,0.7896
"Mandarin Oriental in Kuala Lumpur is one of the best hotels I’ve ever been to. And these were quite a few. Service is excellent, The staffs aim seems to be that you don’t have to ask for something, they would ask you first. I can recommend the rooms with Tower view, astonishing! And to choose the club privileges, breakfast, lunch, tea, and drinks in the evening on 24th floor. Anyhow if you are not late for breakfast, you must go down to Mosaic restaurant for breakfast - best ever!",5,0.957
"I have a business trip for two weeks in Kuala Lumpur and happened to stay in their Deluxe Twin Tower view. The view was second to none. You will be able to capture the famous Malaysia landscape Twin Tower on the left side of your very own window, while on the right side Suria Park's fountain will dancing and give you a beautiful lighting show in the evening.  Upon my arrival Ahmad and Michele from the Guest Relations team has prepared a belated birthday gift as they know my birthday was a week a go, such a thoughtful touch!. Thank you soo much for the eye cover, i loved it! 🐣  As a member of Fans of MO, I also received a box full of delicious local chocolate, which i finish it quickly because it tasted that good!! Pssst... they told me the amenity will change from time to time!",5,0.9763
"Stayed at the MO in KL for the third time.  It never disappoints.  The property is beautiful, location is great and the staff always greets with a smile and helps in any way they can.  Rooms are nice size, clean and nicely appointed.  ",5,0.9729
"This was our 3rd hotel during our trip and it stands out due to the view ! We were on the 19th floor with a towers view and the added benefit of the Symphony Lake view which was an added bonus. All the staff were very courteous and with the recent Coronavirus they were quick to act on temperature readings on arrival, hand alcohol gel was available almost everywhere. The only criticism was that at busy breakfast time your coffee (the most important drink to start the day) which is ordered as you are seated was very slow getting to the table - everyone of our 4 mornings we half way through our breakfast before it arrived. But the breakfast had everything to offer.  We had the best time and views and will certainly return to this hotel next time in KL",5,0.9606
"After a frisky start, the stay got better and better.  As a 'fan of Mo' - loyalty club, you can choose 2 benefits, my chosen option was early check in and late checkout. When we arrived agree a long flight, I chose to check in early 12am instead of the usual 3PM.  When we arrived our room wasn't ready and we were told to await for approx 1 - 2 hours - this wasn't a problem as we just relaxed by the pool. Checked after 2 hours, room was not ready. After 3 hour we hadn't heard anything so asked reception if our room was ready and after 5 mins they gave us our room key - as we were booked into a club room we weren't told of the benefits nor were we told if breakfast was included. After we got into out room 2 hours had passed and we were still without our luggage so had to ring to",4,0.9629
"I was really happy that the rates were good for this hotel.  Everything met or exceeded my expectations. The hotel is spotless and elegant.  The service is fantastic. We had a basic twin room with a view of the twin towers. The location was perfect for us as most of what we wanted to do was within a mile of it.  There is a great fountain light show next door at KLCC park that goes at 8, 9 and 10 each evening. A huge shopping center and lots of restaurants and foot options as well.  We ate three times in the hotel. Twice at Aqua by the nice infinity pool with a great view and once at Mosiac for breakfast.  All-in-all we had a great stay.  ",5,0.9889
"This hotel is very comfortable,espesially lounge.Every afternoon and evening,we enjoyed longe. foods in lounge are very delicious .  This hotel  is close to shopping center ,Isetan store inside, so we enjoyed shopping,restaurant and foot massage. ",5,0.8908
"Delightful plush hotel.  Great location right next to Petronas Towers and KLCC Park.  Excellent food and service in the Executive Lounge.  Ahmad, Sarah, and Mariana were especially helpful.  All the hotel restaurants were good.  The pool overlooking the park was a real pleasure.",5,0.9694
"A heart shape is given by a barista with a cup of latte. It's not just that meaningful to me but also surrounded by the barista's embrace. The food is delicious, I guess each of you will not regret to take an opportunity to visit it. Remember to try a cup of coffee before leave without saying goodbye because it could be a golden memories of your entire life.",5,0.9315
"Had an excellent dinner (Peking Duck) in the chinese restaurant Lai Po Heen at the hotel. Very very good food, and extremely good service. We appreciated the advices from the manager KC Chan and his staff very much. We will be back!",5,0.8918
"We stayed 3 nights in Feb, our first impressions were wow, the reception and especially concierge staff are a credit and nothing is too much trouble. Our room was a delux pool view, it was a really nice room but not wow, we had to ask for more shampoo and conditioner, strange for a five star? Breakfast was excellent so much choice and great quality. One slight issue was the pool staff were quite complacent at times, having just come from the Shangri la in Penang I expected the same 5 star service but it was lacking, the staff completely changed when management appeared - we ordered desert and after 30 minutes cancelled it as we were forgotten, it was only ice cream? I have not given this 5 stars as after visiting the Mandarin in Bangkok this is definitely the poorer sister.",4,0.9474
"Stayed at this hotel in twin towers view room, wow what a fantastic room corner room with massive panoramic windows one with direct views of the Petronis Towers.  We had room service for evening meal and a member of staff arrived with a table full of fantastic food , wheeled the table into the room and set the food out for us.  All staff amazing this is what customer service is all about.  Hotel in a fantastic location central to everything.  If your going to Kuala Lumper you have to stay at this hotel.  ",5,0.9607
"I have stayed in a number of MO hotels around the world and the whole concept is so consistent no matter where you go. The MO in KL is no exception, offering a fantastic range of restaurants, a superb infinity pool on the 3rd floor, fantastic location in the golden triangle, right in the heart of what KL has to offer. Room facilities and room service is excellent and the staff cannot do enough for you.",5,0.9137
"I tend to be very critical in most of my TA reviews,  but I genuinely cannot find any fault, negative or criticism of the Mandarin Oriental in KL. The moment our car pulled up at the front and the welcome we were given, I felt like we were returning guests.  We arrived at 1030 in the morning so our room wasn’t ready, understandably. However, our luggage was stored and we were invited to make use of the spa, sauna and jacuzzi while we waited.  After a 16 journey from the UK this was a wonderful way to unwind and refresh.   We were allocated room 2105 which was a corner room with a park view. It’s a lovely room with beautiful views over the park.  However when we got into our room we found it hadn’t been serviced.  The reception desk were most apologetic and offered us lunch while",5,0.9652
"We recently went to Kuala Lumpur (KL) to visit our family and friends in celebration of Lunar New Year. The idea of spending one night at Mandarin Oriental (MO) came to mind as we would like to explore the city center with our little one. We all agreed that it was one of the most pleasant experiences for this trip – my 4 year old daughter still raves about it now. Here are the key takeaways out of our stay:  -	We purchased MO’s Lunar New Year package (directly from the hotel) that covered one-night stay, breakfast for 2 (complimentary for our kid), US$50 for any SPA treatment. I consider that very good value for money, compared to rates of other intermediary websites. We were pleasantly surprised to receive some complimentary gourmet dark chocolate (made of Malaysia-grown cocoa)",5,0.9721
"Nice room, twin bed and corner park view. The wardrobes are small and there is limited draw space. For me (at 6ft4/193cm) the single bed is comfortable but my legs don’t fit. Room service is through, it re-arranges everything while I am out e.g. folding clothes left out and arranging bathroom toiletries onto a flannel (why?) in neat lines and moves it all back again into line when I move them.  Breakfast is a large buffet on the ground floor. Big selection of breads, bagels and yoghurt as well as porridge. Limited choice of cold meats and cheese.  I found the shower gel provided to be a problem. When I closed the lid some shot into my eye. With this particular product I then experienced 5 minutes of intense pain which them reduced after bathing eye into a general pain for",4,-0.431
"Great service is an understatement. From the smiling airport concierge and our hotel driver we knew our experience was going to be a good one. At check-in Desmond looked after us in a helpful, intuitive and friendly way, and being super helpful with our 3 year old. We had a towers view room, and the view was definitely there, even though the MO is paradoxically too close to the towers to enjoy them in all their size. Room design is classic and elegant. The pool is really nice, great to cool down after a humid day in KL. Malik the restaurant manager was really good, and Hana at the front desk for the Mosaic restaurant always smiling and attentive. If you are at the MO you are literally attached to the KLCC and you can take the 2 minute stroll down to the fountain show if you",4,0.9929

Saufi on the Club Floor was incredible , hospitable employee, he made us feel welcome and very comfortable, true 5 star service. Cuisine at this hotel is top notch, especially the breakfast where it endless choices that all mouth watering. The room was very nice with a great super comfortable bed..

"Spent 3 nights in a Deluxe Club Floor Room (2830) this past long weekend (Fri. Sat. Sun.), and found it really hard to say goodbye.  The room itself was spacious, immaculately clean and had a nice view of the swimming pool and tennis courts far below. And the  hotels and high-rise buildings in the distance painted a clitteting canvas of lights at night that was quite beautiful.   The room attendant (Carrie) provided inconspicuous and attentive service that made my stay all the more enjoyable and restful. She replenished bottles of drinking water, along with pods for the Nespresso Machine, and fresh towels everyday. She even laid out my own toiletetries neatly on a facecloth on the counter for me. I couldn't thank her enough. The bathroom had a nice soaker tub and a separate",5,0.9604

"It would have been a 5/5 knowing MO but...   We check in and choose this being one of the best hotel in Kuala Lumpur for the special day of the year. Check in was a breeze, no doubt excellent service from MO. I've requested to send bouquet of roses to room prior to check in and ensuring the a/c were switch on as we checked in late.   The A/C were faulty. We did not notice it as it was pouring at time of checking and the room wasn't that warm until a while later. Notified the hotel staff before we proceed to our dinner appointment which btw at AQUA in MO as well, then proceed with drinks at the lounge at MO too. There's a change of rooms planned for us, however no one approach us nor contacted me personally until we get into room and had to pack &amp; change after a great night. It",4,0.876

"Absolutely stunning hotel with great facilities. The pool area was a great place to relax, and the breakfast was the best breakfast experience that I have ever had in a hotel. The staff couldn’t do more for us during our stay, and the room was very comfortable, with a luxurious feel. To top it off, the location is superb. I will definitely revisit the hotel when I go back to Kuala Lumpur in the future. ",5,0.984
I was completely thrilled with our stay at the MO. I was debating between this hotel and another and after posting the question on Tripadvisor everyone recommended MO and I am so glad I went with this option. The hotel is in a fab location and we had a Petronas Towers view which was beautiful. The hotel room was stunning and the bathroom was wonderful. Our every whim was met and the staff couldn’t do enough for us. I would definitely stay at this hotel again if ever in KL and the prices are great value for money! Best choice I made on my trip to Malaysia was staying here! ,5,0.9883
We had one night here on our way home from Penang and really appreciated the luxury of this hotel and the attentiveness of the staff.  Its central location is perfect for exploring some of the main highlights of KL if you can tear yourself away from the wonderful food and facilities in the hotel.  The option of a late checkout worked well for us as our flight home was just before midnight.  We would love to stay here again.,5,0.9538

Location is second to none but most important, staff was super nice, extremely professional, always attentive and most important, my family and I felt genuine care for us. Rooms are recently renovated and look immaculate, something difficult to find in KL! Restaurant variety was awesome, loved the gorgeous breakfast buffet at lobby level featuring Malaysia’s three predominant cultures : Malay, Chinese and Indian. Kai po Hen was among the best Chinese food I have eaten in a long long time. The grill was awesome and loved meeting chef Luigi and tasting his “la mamma” food prepared with great love and passion.

"We stayed at the Manadrin Oriental at the end of our honeymonn after being in the Maldives. It was so hard leaving the Maldives as it was so beautiful but when we arrived at the Mandarin we were greeted with such lovely smiles from the doormen and receptionists. When we got to our lovely room there were some beautiful flowers, choclaotes and a card from the hotel wishing us a happy honeymoon which was so nice of them to do. The service was amazing with such friendly staff. We booked our room to have a view of the twin towers which we certainly got and were very happy with.

Hotel facilities are exceptional, the gym, spa, pool, everything without fault. The breakfast buffet is simply amazing, never before have we experienced such quality, choice and comfort. Having availed the use of the club lounge (recommended), the room is huge and the food excellent.  All the staff at the hotel were so helpful, cheery, smiling and pleasant.

"Couldn’t fault this hotel in any way from checking in to out the staff in all departments were first class. Food excellent and service good. Swimming pool very good for a city centre hotel with again good service from the staff, and views over the park, will be better when they finish the construction in one area at the back of park.  We had a view over the tower which in itself was good but I would say get on overlooking the pool as it’s better than looking over the top of the malls ac and solar panels, best views of the towers are from the park.  Would I stay there again definitely yes full marks to everyone there.",5,0.9803

I work for the hotel industry in Spain and I can say that this hotel is my reference after I have been there. The best location in whole Kuala Lumpur.

"We stayed at MOKL for three nights at the start of a 2-week trip to Asia, and it set the towne for the whole journey. Our room (Petronas view) was very comfortable, quiet, and cool, and the service throughout our stay from check-in to check-out was superb. We ate by the pool one evenng, and at Mosaic the other nights, and the food was exceptional, - especially breakfast at Mosiac. Location is good, - right next to KLCC for shopping, - and it was only a short walk to the Eco Gardens and KL Tower. I am sure the other luxury hotels in KL are of a very high standard too, but what sold us before booking was the pool: wonderful location with a fabulous view. Highly recommended.",5,0.9656
"We checked into a room with views to the Twin towers and Park, it's a 23 series corner room. All amenities in room was excellent, the king size bed was comfortable for 2 adults and a child, great views of the towers and park.  At noon time we relaxed at the pool deck area and had a fun time in the pool too, again with views of the Twin towers and park are great from here, lots of pool deck chairs so no worries about not getting one to relax, spent a few hours here, had lunch at the Aqua bar and restaurant which is at the pool level too, our lunch meal was great, one of our favourite item when dining here, the Gambas Tapas is back in the dining menu(was removed last year), and still tasted great and yummy.   We had our dinner meals at Mosaic and Lai Ho Peen(2 days), had evening",5,0.9852
I went to MO in KL with my mother for her birthday and what can I say this Hotel was absolutely incredible. The check in was abit long of a wait especially after travelling almost 16 hours from London to Doha and Doha to KL they could have taken this into consideration but we did have breakfast while we were waiting and spent some time by the pool until our room was ready which took roughly 5/6 hours. The Mosaic team Malini Hana Waty and Miera were amazing and incredibly welcoming every single day for breakfast without fail they made the trip amazing. the turndown service by Noyon was fantastic and efficient always ready by the time we returned from breakfast. The welcome by Mr Kamal and his colleague was exceptional their local knowledge was fantastic and were extremely,4,0.993

I was here a couple of days for a conference. The hotel is near everywhere. The swimming pool has a nice view toward the park. The room is very clean. Service is impeccable as expected. I will certainly come back!,5,0.8169
"We had a tower facing corner room for NYE and it was an unforgettable experience. Overall the hotel is to a high standard with comfortable rooms and helpful staff. The gym is well fitted and the pool has very good views. On the F&amp;B side, the lobby lounge, Mosaic and Aqua were very nice, Lai Ho Peen was disappointing given other MO restaurants we have eaten at, particularly China House in Bangkok. ",4,0.8856
Had an incredible time at the mandarin oriental. The service is just flawless- everyone was super friendly and willing to go the extra mile to make your stay special. Really enjoyed the pool- amazing setting. Breakfast Buffett was probably one of the best I’ve ever seen. ,5,0.9769
High end hotel next to the KLCC twin towers The hotel is well appointed with very helpful staff  English is widely spoken Our basic room was great very comfortable with a great view of the garden. The breakfast was excellent  There were dress codes in some of the restaurants  . I had only brought shorts from Thailand so my dining options in the hotel were limited  Much less restrictions next door at the KLCC,5,0.9627
"Just experienced excellent hospitality from the MO KL team. Booked a weekend stay to celebrate husband's birthday and it was indeed a wonderful experience for him and our kids. Had a smooth check in and check out by Aaron. Was greeted with a great surprise from Roziati who gave us an upgrade to the Junior Suite room for a more memorable birthday celebration. Once we were in the room, husband was surprised by Sarah &amp; Ahmad with a yummy cake! The suite was fantastic - spacious, clean and great view of KLCC's park &amp; fountain.   Kids were excited about the swimming pool and Afiq from Aqua was so attentive and noticed we did not have towels so he brought some for us. Our 2nd day at the pool was just as good with Afiq and Sha greeting me by name.  When leaving the hotel, my 7-year old",5,0.9914

"We enjoyed a 9 night Club Floor stay, partly because the coronavirus scare prevented us from venturing to other location potentials.  We could not have enjoyed our experience more.  The Club Floor was a respite from busy KL, and the staff were truly exceptional in their care and attention.  We especially want to recognize young trainee EL who showed remarkable professionalism and care for such a young recruit.  We hope the Mandarin Oriental Training programs don't lose him!  Housekeeping was also outstanding - attentive to every detail and frequent in their scheduled visits.  Room was very spacious with gorgeous view out to the KLCC Park.  Pool attendants were also fabulous.  The one complaint I have to mention is the noise level in the room when we had particularly raucous",5,0.986
"The property was magnificently decorated for Chinese New Year. Service is excellent, always present but very understated.  We have eaten in the Chinese restaurant and even though it came highly recommended, food was nothing to write home about.  Rooms are tastefully decorated and view at the Petronas is awesome.  Close proximity to shopping mall and many restaurants in the Petronas towers makes this hotel’s destination hard to beat. Highly recommend.",5,0.9471
I enjoyed my stay here and would highly recommend it. I loved the pool area for relaxing after sight seeing. Aqua has a great menu and all staff are eager to help and extremely friendly (especially Firdaus by the pool) ,5,0.9782

"I spent three weeks at the MO in KL.  Services was fantastic, rooms are fantastic, location is fantastic.  Truly a 5-star experience.  Location doesn't get any better.  Within less than a minute walk you have KLCC lake, a shopping centre, supermarket, food, gym (for those who need a squat rack), and best coffee in town (Eight Ounce in Surya KLCC).  Their loyalty program leaves a lot to be desired but otherwise an amazing hotel.",5,0.9497
"This is the 2nd time we stayed at the Mandarin for our anniversary. Just a night because we have the Elite club membership &amp; we were treated very well right from the beginning till the end. Checked in last Friday jan18. What a lovely surprise to receive a bouquet of flowers and a chocolate cake! Dinner reservations at the Mosaic was handled well &amp;  service was excellent. I remembered one name, Suhaime. Thanks! The room was really nice with a great view. Only thing was the aircon wasn't comfortably cool &amp; in the afternoon, it was HOT.  Thanks once again.

"We stayed in a very common room, but the room was spacious and the bed was comfortable.  The quality of the amenities was also good.  Also, it was nice to have porridge for breakfast.  Above all, the concierge was excellent.  We asked for advice on sightseeing and meals every day, but they gave us good recommendations every time.  Especially when we consulted about sightseeing on the way to the airport on our return day, Assistant Chief Concierge was kindly advised and  arranged the best taxi, so I was able to do a good sightseeing.  I strongly hope to stay again.",5,0.9925
"We had a Petronas Tower view room and it was really worth the small extra amount as the view was truly impressive. Everything about this hotel is sophisticated, from the cool drinks offered to us at check in and again at check out and everything in between. Mandarin Oriental really know what a customer wants, their staff are highly trained, every member we met were welcoming and ready to serve you, you felt valued as a guest. The rooms are very spacious, and provide every conceivable amenity that you may need, although the bathroom was a bit compact but they provide generous toiletries including dental and shaving packs. Welcome drinks are left in your room as well as 2 large bottles of filtered water, we were also given a small box of chocolate when we checked in as we are MO",5,0.9698
"I would like to express how satisfied I am with Ms. HALIMATON’s professional and attentive service. She was so thoughtful and made every single thing happen at once. Beginning with finding me a good seat, charging my phone, recommending me a nice local dish until providing me with other refreshing stuffs. This is definitely the service of MO yet Ms. HALIMATON’s service is even above and beyond! ",5,0.9465

Nice and cosy stay. Worth it for the price. The ambiance and quality is very good. The pool is also good though a bit small. Overall a good staying experience. The view from the room was surreal at 26th floor. ,5,0.9228
A wonderful hotel in a very convenient location. We stayed for 3 nights in an executive park view room on the 22nd floor which had a nice view. All the staff are phenomenally friendly and helpful... perhaps a little bit eager to help for our tastes. The gym is well air conditioned and well equipped. The pool area is beautiful and the opening times make it easy to fit in some time there. The free chilled water and cold towels are much appreciated. The breakfast spread is amazing; great quality and choices for all nationalities. We didn’t pay for club access so can’t comment on that but we don’t feel it would have been worth it for us. ,5,0.97
"Our stay was incredible. Beautiful room looking straight into the twin towers and park. Favorite buffet brekky spread hands down and we love our brekky buffet spreads. From the moment we checked in, we were greeted with open arms by Michelle, thank you for all your help! She then came to our room with Ahmad whom so kindly gave us the download on where to go, what to see and where to eat. Because of these two we were all set for the few days we were in KL. Thank you both! One night we had a further question and Yan guided us in the right direction, much appreciated as well Yan! We really enjoyed the gym and spa to!",5,0.9883

"My husband and I spent lovely days at Mandarin oriental at the middle of January. Our choice fall to this hotel first of all  because of location and name.  Location is really great, just next door of Petronas towers, there are different types of restaurants around and local supermarkets. The room was very spacious, tidy and very clean (Important point for us),with all necessary supplies for 2 persons, first time I didn’t call housekeeping with request of missing stuff at bathroom or the room. As we were traveling for last 2 weeks and came from another continent we had very badly jet lag and couldn’t recover for almost 2 days. All this time the button “do not disturb” was switch on, after 1,5 day we got the call from the staff member which asked if everything is ok and do we",5,0.7294
"Lovely rooms, pool and facilities and great location. Let down by the service. Long queues for check in and breakfast. Service was poor. By the pool our food order was forgotten and I had to ask for coffee at breakfast 3 times and then go find milk and a spoon by myself. Breakfast was good but replenishment very slow and just too packed to be relaxing. What was meant to be a birthday treat was a bit disappointing.",3,0.7876
"My last stay was more than 10 years ago.  In 2019, I had several trips to Kuala Lumpur with my partner and we had been staying in other hotels.  In our most recent 2 trips, we chose Mandarin Oriental.    The hotel seriously needs updating and refurbishments.  The rooms and lounge looked as dated as a decade ago.  No negative review on the housekeeping, size of room and the service of staff from check-in, lounge to spa.  Keep it up!  We had a lunch at the all-day restaurant.  Their buffet looked sumptuous but we took the ala-carte instead as we did not have much time to enjoy a long lunch.  We also had the afternoon tea at the lounge.  Good selection of tea, but they gotta improve on the scones - they were too crumbly and were not warm when they came to our table.",4,0.8399
"Checked in was smooth even I was accidently booked the wrong date, but the receptionist Amirul &amp; reservation staff Fatihin managed to assist and find a room for me. Overall stay was good, only the loud music in the room during departure time was annoying, instead of ""chasing' the guest at 11.45 am you may practised to do a courtesy call to them. Overall was good, keep up the great service rendered by your team. ",5,0.9186
"This was my wife's and mine first visit to Kuala Lumpur and we are so pleased that we chose this hotel. The location is ideal as a base, and perfect for a view of the iconic Petronas Twin Towers. All of the staff were very courteous, very friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them; so much so that it was a pleasure speaking with them. The breakfast certainly did not disappoint, and the selection of food available would cater for anyone's taste. The room was spotlessly clean throughout our stay, and we felt thoroughly spoilt; the bed and pillows were luxuriously comfortable, meaning we both slept soundly! Attention to detail is obviously their motto, as there was simply nothing to complain about; the entire stay was 100% first class. We will definitely return.",5,0.9872
"I have just arrived at the Mandarin for my first ever visit. What a welcome we received from Mohana and Mariana. Mohana was particularly kind and friendly from the moment we arrived. After mentioning we were celebrating my fiancé's 30th birthday, she noted from my passport that I too had a belated birthday. Shortly after arriving at our room, we were surprised with cake, flowers and cards. This was totally unexpected and showed fantastic customer service.

It's definitely not the usual MO by international standards; the decor; services and quality of staff are just not the usual MO in other cities.  Staff and not well-trained, some of them do not know what they are supposed to be doing.  Asked for direction from the porters and they not that forthcoming.  Breakfast is really so so, I was at a point of skipping breakfast one morning because of the limited spread of food.  This may be contributed to the Muslim community which they have to cater for.  Service during breakfast is dreadful, order tea and they never arrived the first morning and I have to help myself with making the tea at the counter.",3,-0.3182
