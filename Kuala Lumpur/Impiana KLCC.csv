"I recently stayed at the Impiana on my honeymoon and really enjoyed my stay. The check in process was very long and time consuming, i wouldnt recommend arriving at 12-2pm, as there were long lines. The hotel is in a great location to access KLCC and the Pavillion shopping centre. The hotel has a great open air bar, and a nice pool. The pool has very few chairs so i would recommend arriving early, or late. Overall really enjoyed my experience!",4,0.9456
We have been 2 1/2 days in Kuala Lumpur for sightseeing. Hotel is located perfectly in the city center. You can reach Petronas Twin Towers and even Bukit Bintang via pedestrian overpasses. I want to specially mention the concierge service (Mr. Syafiq) of the hotel: We booked a trip to Melaka at getyourguide for the wrong day and we have already been waiting for the pickup service. But he managed it that we could even join the Melaka trip the same day. Special thanks to Mr Syafiq,5,0.8519
"There was plenty of choices breakfast no matter western cuisine or local cuisine. The food is good quality, fresh, tasty and always refill by their staff when food is almost finish. Room is big enough for us, tidy, clean and supplying with toiletries. The only bad is car park. We drive a velfire to there, is super duper hard for us to enter the car park, hard to turn around, hard to parking. ",5,0.6124
"We were booking in to this hotel fro 4 nights from 15 March until tomorrow. Sadly because of the lock down in Malaysia due to the virus we have had to return home. However the staff at this beautiful hotel could not have been any more gracious and accommodating. Anything requested was met with instant results and good grace. The room was clean, spacious, comfortable and welcoming, the food was outstanding and plentiful. I would highly recommend this hotel to any travellers. Thank you again Impiana. ",5,0.9828
I really love the room and amenities.. The room is clean and the view was pleasant. Customer service was excellent and surely will recommend to others. Overall everything was MEMORABLE and we definitely will coming back !,5,0.9705

"Walking distance to Pavilion and KLCC. Linked bridge to the hotel. Newly renovated rooms but the air con was not that cold, not sure whether they are operating at a minimum output. Water pressure for shower was also not strong. Not much variety for breakfast. ",3,-0.8315
"Very nice hotel. Staff are so so friendly. Location is very good. From window you can see Petronas tower. Room is so big and clean, bed is comfortable and everything is soo good. I really recommend this hotel! ",5,0.9729
Stay: 08/03/2020. My second time in this hotel.  Location : Very Good. Attached to the hotel above is the over-head KL city bridge connector which plys around places of interest around that area. Sheltered from rain and sun. In the morning I was able to walk to the nearby KLCC park via this over-head bridge and have a refreshing brisk walk there.  It is also Walking distance to the Raja Chulan KL Monorail. Walk further and you can reach the nearby Bukit Bintang shopping areas.  Alternatively you can take the monorail to reach Berjaya Times Square; just 2 stations away.   Room 705 : Stayed at the Superior room. Clean and with wooden flooring. The bed was very comfortable. Design is considered modern.  There was enough USB connectors in the room that I did not have to use mine.,4,0.95
"So comfortable, friendly staff, excellent food. So enjoyable to stay here.We had a 3 night stay to our business trip and were very satisfied with every aspect of the hotel. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The hotel is very clean throughout, and our room was spacious with everything that we needed. Breakfast was substantial, and suited all tastes. The hotel is quiet, and is situated near to our client office (Petronas Tower 3), and within easy walking distance. We would highly recommend a stay at this hotel.",5,0.9862
"Good service and the staffs are friendly. On location wise, very near to KL Convention Center &amp; Suria KLCC. The foods (breakfast) are variety and delicious. Check in &amp; check out process went very well. No problem at all. Just the problem is the parking, very limited and the parking area very narrow. ",4,0.6902
Room was not cleaned properly. Found half eaten yogurt and empty bottle. Front desk did not apologize and only wanted to get housekeeping up to clean. Requested for change in room as I did not want to wait. Stayed mon to Fri and did an extension.  System was not updated accordingly and front desk sent another guest to my room who rang my doorbell multiple times at 1.30am. Night manager also came up to ask why am I in the room and for guest name. Terrible service and everything was swept under the rug. ,2,-0.4055
"I booked the hotel through an external travel website. Check-in was fast and efficient. Soon, the hotel concierge Ms Nazmin came up to get me to sign some form. She asked how my stay was thus far. I casually remarked that I thought my room would come with a bathtub. On her own accord, she offered me a free upgrade to a room with a bathtub as I was staying for an extended period.  The room itself is generally clean and the location is pretty conveniant : a 5 min walk to klcc station",4,0.9136
The two Indian lady manager all the staff very very courteous. Breakfast good .The rooms very good location walking distance to Pavilion mall connected by bridge. Everything about the hotel was nice. The room was clean bedsheets fresh Bathroom was clean and fresh I will always stay there in future,5,0.9682
"I have difficulty in walking due to my leg nerves injury recently, so as i was walking to the breakfast area this morning, it was very difficult for me to walk up the stairs. When i finishes my breakfast, one of your staff from the morning F&amp;B crew, if I’m not mistaken her name is Corina, notice the way i walk, and ask what happened? She later suggested me to put some ice pack on it. I took her suggestion and the pain slightly go away. I would like to put a good review on her as a token of appreciation as she is very attentive and caring to the guests. ",5,0.3779
"Family short trip. Walking distance to Suria KLCC, Pavilion KL and petronas twin towers. The room was big with comfortable bed and clean as well. Front desk staff friendly. Overall experience is great.",5,0.9371
"Very recommend this hotel! Near to the shopping mall and kl convect.special thanks to staff atika was very friendly,and always smile make us feel very welcome.not forget,ur restaurant breakfast is excellent. Many variety of food and staff very nice.surelly will return back to your hotel soon!",5,0.9143
"I had a very pleasant stay at Impiana klcc. The location is good, just in the city center, the staff is kind and always cares to make sure you’re ok. The food is various and excellent! The breakfast buffet and the dinner buffet provide a huge range of food from international to Malaysian. ",5,0.9708
"It's location is superb whereby it is linked to the bridge connecting to KLCC shopping mall and also other malls are nearby. However, the air conditioning system in the room spoilt the whole experience.",2,0.6249
"I think the only slack with the hotel is the room. You guys rly need to change the light for the room and for the bathroom. It’s quite dim and inconvenience. Maybe by adding more lights in the room and especially in the shower area, I think it’ll be more better. Oth than that, I think everything are quite ok.",3,0.4446
"Impiana Hotel is situated at strategic place. However, the hotel service, facilities and amenities need further improvement. We were frustrated for getting a poor service and hotel facilities during over stay recently in Feb- March 2020. The service is not up to the price paid for per night.",2,-0.5423
"I treated myself to one night in the Impiana as I had booked a spa package at the Swasana Spa, and wished I could have stayed longer.  My bedroom was large and spacious with wonderful views of the city skyline, I loved the waterfall shower in the bathroom, supersoft towels and flatbed tv.  Breakfast was included in the price and included a wide range of local and international dishes.  The location of the hotel in KLCC is excellent, and linked to the Pavilion-KLCC walkway.  Wonderful in every way.",5,0.9432
Different menu in breakfast The same menu was repeated every day. Secondly the tea was not very hot. Otherwise everything was good including the staff members they were very helpful. the housekeeping was also very good,4,0.8357
"Checked in into the room, spacious and has the twin towers’s view. Bed was extremely comfortable. Bathroom, the bathtub is not on it’s best condition, stained and scratched. Towels, the end bits thorn.  In the evening, the group decided to have a drink at the bar. There was only our group was there but the service was super slow. Staff was not observant and far from being attentive. Ordered gin and tonic, they didn’t even asked what kind of gin do we want....and when asked about what kind of vodka do they have? They don’t even know. Watching them working and not being understand with the order is not what I wish to experience in a big hotel like this.  An up-selling and product knowledge training is much needed for the service staff, once they know the product they are serving,",4,0.7799
"Had my phone, passport, money and bank cards pick-pocketed on the way to this hotel and arrived quite stressed out. Mr Burn the head concierge leads a wonderful front office team, and he and Atiqah and the others whose names sadly I did not get, went above and beyond to help. They even arranged to take me to the police station and then to the Embassy to sort out a new passport. This was exceptional service and very kind at an extremely difficult time.  I will never forget you all , and how you helped a stranger in need.",5,0.5382
Visiting Impiana KLCC Hotel again this month for another gathering with old friends at the restaurant. We were greeted while waiting at the lobby by Ms Maya whom was very friendly and informative about the upcoming events which we found quite interesting. Excellent customer service and experience so far at the restaurant.,5,0.9409
"This hotel having excellent location and excellent excess to city centre. The link bridge is link to the hotel and make you move smooth. Hotel environment itself very clean and you will welcome by friendly staff. Maya was very pleasant and friendly and most of staff are friendly too. Room was great and very clean, cleaner are friendly too. We love the huge towel in the room and comfy bed,its truly make our stay more comfortable. Nice hotel to stay while you in KL.Fully recommend this hotel to everyone. Will come back and thank you for the pleasant experience.",5,0.9961
"The most impressive part of our 6 day stay at this superbly located hotel was the caring &amp; helpful staff. This was particularly evident in the reception, guest lounge &amp; spa.  We were particularly impressed with the services of the cocktail barman on the 15th floor.",4,0.9183
"Being in city center on opposite side of kccl conventional center, it is very conveniant to attend the conference. Even in an un_expected rainy day, can go by weather proof corrider. Shopping malls and food centers are in 5 min distance. Swimming pool is large and had good view from rooftop. Meals are smooth and teasty. Both malay style and European food are served in breakfast bueffet. Staffs are helpful and wearing warm smile.",5,0.8316
"Hi! I!m Cristi from Romania and I was accommodated in room 709. The hotel is located in a special location, in the city center. From the hotel and from the pool you have a perfect view to the Petronas towers. The cleaning service was, indeed, provided by ROMJAN, a very polite kid. The food is varied, very good, but it is the same every day. It's a place I will come back to. I recommend this hotel",5,0.8454
"The room was lovely and comfortable, and the breakfasts were very good too. Furthermore, Club Lounge Staff were very friendly and helpful especially Ying &amp; Dinesh were very welcoming from the start and throughout our stay. Despite its small size, this hotel delivers big on all fronts. I will definitely stay here next time.",4,0.971
Nice hotell but need to be reparera with bed and Wi-Fi. Excellent service by staff. Very much good roms for spa and with a good pool.. Many room to meet other people. Good staff and very good breakfast. Short bed and old. Wi-Fi was bad and I was lucka that I did not have to do any work.  ,4,0.9631
"I would like to give a special praise to Daniel, Tracy, Kahirul, Park, Fizee, and the club lounge manager, Maya. They exceeded all of my expectations and always made me feel welcomed. I loved visiting the lounge everyday for cocktails and dinner. I almost didn't want to leave the hotel because the service in the lounge was outstanding. I even recommended my colleague to upgrade to the lounge and he was very glad he did. Tasty food, a variety of beverages available, and most importantly world class service!!! Whenever I am in KL, I refuse to stay anywhere but Impiana and have access to the club lounge. Love this place and see all of you again very soon!",5,0.9655
"The good - The service is impeccable in this place. Staff cannot do enough for you.   The rooms are huge with all amenities needed. Amazing location with easy access to twin towers. Good breakfast. Free apples. Safe &amp; secure.  The bad - rooms maybe need sprucing up slightly. Tiles in bathroom regrouted with fresh sealent for instance as mine were a little grubby. Pool area is very small for hotel of this size with few beds. There appears to be only a small gap throughout the day where the pool area receives any sun. I visited in February and there is no morning sun on the pool area and the sun goes behind buildings around 4.30pm.   All in all, good hotel, slightly dated.   ",3,0.9678
"My husband and I love the fact that this hotel has sheltered walkways to both KLCC and Pavilion malls... Breakfast variety is good. Front-desk staff are cold and unwelcoming, although we come back to this same hotel frequently since the past two to three years. Housekeeping was short of hand and face towels. There were none upon checking in and none upon housekeeping the next day.... Pipe-in music along the corridor at my room level was very loud. When I called the telephone operator to ask for the volume to be turned down, nothing took place. It was the Chinese New Year season, hence, the traditional festive instrumentals and it was loud. It penetrated our room. We had difficulty sleeping.   Having said the above, we would still go back to this hotel because the room rate is",4,0.8979
"The hotel is comfortable. Location is good. Cleanliness is adequate. Hotel staffs are generally friendly but the tonka bean (restaurant) staff can do better. Looks like they are hating their job which in turn, affect the way they act towards customers.  Design of hotel interior can do alot better. Love the huge TV in the room. The swimming pool is too small.",3,0.9678
"ideal location if you want to move around by foot. Theres even an entrance that is linked to the bridge that links to KLCC, Pavilion and Bukit Bintang.  But comparing to the previous years stay, we noticed that the lift no longer require you to tap your keycard. Its a little uncomfortable knowing anyone can just  get into the lift and get into any floors.  Love the friendly smiles that greeted you day and night by the hotel's entrance door. Those boys are awesome! ",4,0.953
"We enjoyed our 2nd stay at the Impiana very much, and we will stay there again next time we visit KL.  The buffet breakfast is amazing, so much choice, the room was spacious and spotlessly clean.  The staff are very friendly and nothing is too much trouble.  The hotel is linked by a covered walkway to the shopping mall, MRT and PETRONAS Towers. ",5,0.8908
"We like this place conveniently situated in KL center. Staff is very good, hotel is clean, food is excellent. They also have a pool and a spa: never used. From airport better take a taxi, from other places MRT will drop you nearby.",5,0.9168
Very Good experience........ Its close to everything and specially to the pedestrian bridge that takes you to a several places. I would like to stay here again........the ambient also very nice and the food are nice,4,0.8974

Great location of the hotel and presence of a glass passage to go to the Convention building during the hottest time of the day. Wonderful convenience of the Infinity swimming pool and very hospitable hotel staff. Great variety of different dishes in the restaurant and a divine opportunity to observe the night city from the bar on the top floor. It was my first time in Kuala Lumpur and I am really impressed by the quality of the accommodation the hotel provided!,5,0.9744
Excellent hotel specially the club rooms  the view of the twin towers and swimming pool also the club restaurant is excellent . The location of hotel is very nice . I love it . Special thanks for personnel working in club restaurant and reception.,5,0.9664
The hotel had everything we needed. It is well located downtown. The price was right and we were able to walk to many of the places on our travel plan. Our five days in KL was very enjoyable. The hotel is connected to a walkway and that was good during a rain storm.  ,3,0.8016
A strategic location  near major sightseeing and the bridge to pavalion is brilliant idea  The room was clean comfortable I liked view to swimming pool but prefaer highe floor when I asked recaptionect to change my room to upper floor he told me it's unavailable because of mintanac work  Over all Impaina as if my secondary home in Kuala Lumpur and I'm keen to visite the hotel every time I visite Malaysia ,4,0.8608

Just wanted to update an old review in which I took issue with the gluten free offering in the Club Lounge. Well staying again now a few years later and look. This gluten free bread is super tasty and all of the food is great. Thanks to the chefs and all of the kitchen staff. A full review of the whole hotel will come later but wanted to give praise where due.,5,0.9403

Thanks a lot to Asyraf and Yee for making me feel special during my stay. Thank you! This hotel is very convenience because it has that bridge that can connect to convention centre,Twin Towers and Pavillion. ",4,0.9512
"Tired old hotel in a good location. Room is big, but extremely worn. Bathroom looked dirty, but it was in fact old stains/chips and mouldy grouting. Visited by cockroaches in the bathroom both evenings. Air con not working very well. Front desk didn't seem to care... Would not stay again, would not recommend, although the price was affordable i'd rather go to a more modern, clean hotel.",1,-0.8091
"My bestie and I had an amazing staycation (1D2N) at Impiana KLCC last week. Huge ‘Thank You’ goes out to Maya, the Guest Service Manager, who ensured our requests were met with her impeccable follow-through. The room, equipped with a king-size bed, was wonderfully spacious, tastefully furnished and super clean. We also enjoyed a lovely cocktail session on Level 15, which also came with an array of scrumptious finger food, snacks and pastries. All in all, it was a staycation to remember! We’d definitely head back to Impiana KLCC soon. Two-thumbs up!",5,0.9835
"The view from the room was amazing,view of twin tower ( pls book higher floor at club floor) .The staff was lovely , friendly espcially the housekeeping team. The hotel also health concern whereby you able to find hand sanitiser at most of the public area.

We stayed 5 days at impiana hotel  It’s so close to pavilion shopping mall and Petronas twin towers My point for u is if u want to go to pavilion u can use walk way tunnel from hotel to mall and no need to walk,5,-0.2263
"My first experience stayed at this hotel. Friendly staff, new room, strategic hotel and the best part, i like the toilet. Very clean. One more thing, when i book this hotel, it comes together with breakfast(offered by hotel i guess). Definitely will stay here again.",5,0.9392
"I was here for 3 nights and asked for a quiet room: they gave me a room on the floor below the restaurant where a live band plays in the evening and i could hear the music very loud. I asked for a different room, they gave me one that stunk of cigarette and had to go to reception again. Third time lucky, although there was no apology from the reception staff who even seemed quite bothered about my request. On a bright side the location is really good and the restaurant on the 15th floor serves great food with a great view.",4,0.9169
"We booked 3 nights, Saturday through Tuesday at a very good weekend rate. As it was also a holiday weekend in Malaysia demand was high and since we were only two so they upgraded us to a club room. The room was fantastic and the bed the most comfortable I have ever slept on. Great service from the concierge and all the staff. The overhead bridge from the 3rd floor of the hotel to the Pavillian shopping centre in the centre of Bukit Butang was brilliant, it’s about a kilometre in length. Pedestrian only, security personnel at either end and cctv cameras throughout the length. Incredibly safe.",4,0.9778
"I saw my reservation which showed a room on the 13th floor. Without mentioning a reason the woman at the front desk “downgraded‘ us to a room on the second floor, which was dark and ugly. Thank god we had some trouble with the door opening system so we finally got a perfect room on 7th floor.  So be careful at the check-in.  The rest was good. Good breakfast , very good housekeeping on the 7th floor and even more thanks for the guy who was running the pool bar. We hope that their bosses will them how satisfied we were.",5,0.9627
Love the room .. i think its a new room .  1007 was spacious for us to hang around and talk . Deco is simple and  fresh . Room facing front and we had a great time during breakfast . Celebrated my sister birthday and we had a lot of  fun . Thank you impiana,5,0.9643
"This is a luxury but affordable hotel in the heart of KL. Recommend the club level rooms. Very well appointed with great facilities. The club lounge offers good selections in the evenings. The spa services are exceptional. Hotel is connected via link bridge to Suria KLCC mall so its easy walking distance to all the major attractions in the heart of the city. This hotel is rated four star but boasts five star facilities and service at prices that won’t break the bank! Will be here again. NB: The only sub-par event worth mentioning about KL is the absurd and unusually long immigration  queues at the airport. This needs to improve massively, both at the points of entry and exit, otherwise, Malaysia is lovely!   ",5,0.9897
"My colleagues and I have a lunch buffet here and the food were delicious. They have a BR ice cream buffet too! And worst incident happen when I left my ring in the washroom. I went back to the hotel and thank god, the ring was kept safely by the staff. I am so thankful for the integrity and nice services by the Impiana KLCC Hotel. Thank you so much!",5,0.9619
I highly recommend the Impiana hotel . I stayed for 8 days and was impressed with the high quality features in all aspects of the hotel as well as the professional and helpful service I received from Rosnaini and Tila. As a guest from Germany I was provided with a very warm welcome and fantastic hospitality was consistent throughout my stay. Burn was also very helpful providing me with information and advice on where to go and how to best spend my time in the 8 days I had.  Overall I’m very happy with my experience at this hotel and would not hesitate to be a guest here again.,5,0.9844
100% worth it. I was on floor 21. I did not get the room with breakfast however I was told by friends that they had a marvelous breakfast spread next time I would like to try that. overall I'm so happy with the room the cleanliness the decor or the safety basically everything. Hundred percent satisfied.,5,0.9672
"The rooms are basic with ample space and great window size and if you are lucky it comes with a great view of the towers. Some rooms are with parquet floor which is high on my list. Bathroom is spacious, towels are luscious, toiletries are boring.  Club floor breakfast is so basic than the main breakfast area which is disappointing. Happy hour finger food is also boring and uneventful.  The location is great, with the connecting pedestrian bridges connecting malls.  Basically is a old great local hotel that is trying to cash on the location but more of a business hotel compared to the other big hotels around it. Room service crew are polite and friendly, cleaned up the room fast and effeciently.",3,0.9239
"Hotel staff were not that friendly. Not smiling and we felt unwelcomed. One trainee (name is Jo?) is cheerful and polite. Also one housekeeping attendant was nice. Other than that hotel staff needs to be more polite and should at least welcome guests with a smile.  Our room was fine but not the room we thought we booked for online. Tried to ask the operator of what had happened, and we cannot understand her explanation.  However, hotel has a great location walking distance from Petronas towers. Safe with security personnels. Hotel room was okay. Breakfast was nice.  Hoping for better accommodating staff the next time i bring my family. because the feeling that you are welcome in the hotel is important for travellers.",3,0.9898
We stayed during the CNY weekend and it was had a late check-in. Checked was smooth and we got the room facing KLCC. Housekeeping was excellent and our requests for extra towels each night were prompt. There's also a pillow menu and again request was prompt and pillows were comfortable. Breakfast choices were standard it was very crowded each morning. But the staff really did their best to manage the guests which is a good job. Location is the best as it is link to the KLCC-Bukit Bintang bridge and that's the no. 1 reason we chose this place. Will stay here again when it's less crowded next time. ,4,0.956
Enjoyed our short vacation with excellent service by your staffs overall. An unexpected surprise and  thoughtful service by Ms. Maya with B-day cake and room decor which was impressive. Your service was fabulous.  Thank you.,5,0.9633

"We spent three nights here celebrating my daughters 21st birthday. We opted for a club room which is well worth the extra, you can have your breakfast in the club lounge which has just as good a selection of food as the main dinning area but on a smaller set up scale and also has a live cooking station as well with a lovely friendly chef, it's much calmer than the main dinning area which does get very busy and loud. Also in the Club room you have expresso  and other real coffee options and herbal teas, only mentioning this as they are extra charges for these in the main buffet breakfast service.  There is also an afternoon tea with food available around three I think and best of all free flowing drinks and snacks from 5 or 5,30 to 7.30pm. The staff in the club lounge are really",5,0.9845

"Decided to have a short two nights stay here and I am in love with the level of anticipatory service extended by Sumi from housekeeping. He noticed that I drank lots of water during my stay, he anticipated my needs and placed additional water bottles! Met with Sumi twice during my stay, very friendly and genuine by asking if I would need anything from him when he makes up my room.   He tidied up my room and kept the room immaculate clean. Spotless! Not to missed out folding my nightwear neatly.   There is pillow menu in the room with a total of 8 choices for you to choose but I skipped those. The existing feather pillows were more than comfortable enough for me and my wife.   I was assigned to a room with a nice city view! Will be back again in three weeks time as it is",5,0.9537
I was there for a staycation . There is a connection bridge from the hotel to klcc and pavilion. I did not need to take any other transportation . Everything is nearby. Breakfast selection was good . Concierge was friendly and informative. They provide us map to walk around . Good and comfortable place to be . ,5,0.9062

My husband and I check in to impiana for anniversary . Check in was a breeze... room was superb with decoration for our celebration. Breakfast a lot of selection. We went to spa and enjoy the view from the pool area. Was a great memorable stay.,5,0.9081
It was a short staycation. Stayed there with my kids and they love the pool so much. Swasana Spa is great... And I did pedicure in the saloon.... It is just a wonderful short relaxation trip. Will come back next month for my son birthday. ,5,0.9062
"Booked a Club Room on the 24th floor. Checked in on the 15th Floor was a breeze with Daniel who was at the desk. Daniel has such a pleasant and warm personality that he makes us feel so warm and homely here. Always accommodating to our needs and chatty,Daniel has showed some perfect honest and sincere customer service throughout our stay. Tracy one of the staff at the Club Lounge is also one of the staff that greets and try to make small talks with us. These two people has made our stay a really great one yet here. The Club Benefits allows you to have Breakfast 6.30am-10.30am,Tea Time 3pm-5pm and Cocktail Time 5.30pm-7.30pm all at the 15th Floor Club Lounge. Food are great and we appreciate the afternoon tea after a long morning walk. Had breakfast at Tonka Beans downstairs on",5,0.9841
"location is very good, jalan alo market, pavillion, twin tower, etc... but low floor's view is not good, and room window is not open. to recommend high floor room. So, roof top pool is very good, pool's view is fantastic. ",5,0.931
"Average hotel with some things to improve. Its showing some deteriorations since it is no new hotel. For example deteriorated things in bathroom, really awful views from the back rooms, no desk or chairs in double rooms… breakfast is ok. Gym is great!",3,0.4213
"It felt like a 4-star hotel. Quiet and comfortable room, with all the usual amenities that's expected of a hotel. They have a wide variety of dishes for the breakfast spread, and the menu changes each day.    Nevertheless, there's always room for improvement. Some of the toilet amenities were not replenished in the morning, and there's just one cook manning the kitchen. ",4,0.8316

"Booking double bed room with bathtub. But get twin single bed room (the bed join together). and the bathroom dont have bathtub. Reach hotel after 5p.m, line up for checking more than 10 minutes !! During my turn, staff tell me that need to wait until my name get call, the room not ready yet! Why the room not ready yet? it is already 5p.m.  I force to wait another 5 minutes, name still not calling yet, so i go to reception ask again. Another staff give me room key. So i go to my room, I see twin single bed and without bathtub. I decided go to reception and ask for changing room, the staff ask manager to see me, manager tell me that, all double bed are full, no more double bed. I no choice, finally l stay at that room. I dont think this is 4 star hotel, reception is leak of staff,",1,-0.8303

"We stayed here for 3 nights over New Year 2019 and had 2 deluxe rooms.  I haven't been able to identify the difference between deluxe and superior rooms other than cost.  Great breakfast but get down there early (before 9) as it gets very busy and difficult to get a table. Good selection of all sorts of food and great egg stations. Room was big and spacious and the bed was comfortable, sometimes however housekeeping didn't come in until quite late in the day. It's a big hotel and the wait for lifts is sometimes long.   Nice pool though not enough beds/chairs and tables around. We booked to spend new year at the poolside. Good job we got there before the 10.00 start as there weren't enough tables, they kept the sunbeds there - goodness knows why. It would have been sensible to",4,0.9811
looking at the price i did not expect much at first. But the warm welcome i get from the staffs from the moment i walk in was nice. They even helped my wife to carry her luggage. She is pregnant and check in was a breeze. The concierge assisted us well with the tour package information .. I feel asian hospitality at its best here in impiana. ,5,0.9186
i came here and found out that i have wrongly booked a twin room. it was so kind of the reception young girl... if i am not mistaken intang... i got an upgrade facing to the pool. lovely it was my birthday and the location is perfect to avoid the jam. best staycation ever,5,0.912
Brought my parents here for new year. Have been one of the best new year celebrations. The staffs are very courteous. They really took care of my elderly parents. We arrived early we are thankful the front lady Mumu gave us room as soon as possible. I will return for my anniversary soon . ,5,0.943
"Stayed here due to it's location to KLCC. Very convenient. Room was abit small and had old feeling to it but otherwise clean and sufficient. For a Deluxe Room, you'd still get a bathtub which was a plus. Got room on the swimming pool level (level 4), but extra security doors secluded us from the public's entrance which is good too. Customer service always check back with you if you've gotten everything you requested. ",4,0.8945
"Didnt expect such property fora 4 star hotel, room is outdated and run down, tv channels are limited and blurred  Hotel staffs are not friendly and not very helpful  Breakfast menus are mostly the same everyday  ",2,-0.725
"The hotel is situated right opposite of Grand Hyatt. Although it's close to the klcc, you cant get a full view of the iconic tower. Just a glimpse of it here and there. Perhaps higher floor can give you a better view. One thing that need to be emphasize on would be their breakfast. They have a wide range of breakfast menu and it is delicious too. Not to forget, they have a variety of pillow which you can choose from their pillow menu. Although we can differentiate the pillow ordered with an existing one, we hd fun experimenting with them ;).. Overall, worth staying..",4,0.9378
"Nice and clean hotel in the middle of KL, near to the towers and close to public tramsportation. Nice and friendly staff and a beautiful pooldeck on 4th floor. Food in lower plan was not so good, we had the new years eve buffè and some of the seafood was not fresh, oysters smelled bad and some crayfish was nearly raw.  ",4,0.6917
"Cleanliness of this place is horrid! I stayed at this hotel for a week and noticed there was a lot of stains on the bedsheets the first day, second day the same stains are there, third, fourth day, the whole week and the same stains are there (concluding they DO NOT CHANGE SHEETS EVER) what you don’t have to be a genius to find out because they barely clean the obvious places imagine the places they think customers don’t notice... sometimes they take the trash, sometimes they don’t, sometimes they refil the shampoo, sometimes they don’t. First day there were bath towels but not face towels in the bathroom, second day there were face towels but no bath towels. Drinking glasses, toilet, bath tub, the room was NEVER cleaned properly so I don’t think this hotel has any standards",1,-0.563
"4 minute walk to Patronas Twin Tower and KLCC Park. There is a bridge connecting directly from the hotel to the Pavilion and Bukit Bintang, which is the shopping area of KL. Spacious room yet not cleaned thoroughly probably for the peak season of countdown",4,0
Not returning and not recomanding to friends or people who is interested to travel to malaysia. The management of this hotel have to be more attentive on the security and service section. Otherwise considering closing down!,1,0.4287
Spent most of my time here while in KL. It had all the shops I wanted and located perfectly by the 2 towers.  The Kinokunya shop was massive.  Grab was easy to use while here.  Lots of currency conversion places.  If you're a tourist and need a sim card go to the 7-11 shop and tell them you have a passport they will offer you sim cards from behind the counter and they where helpful enough to set everything up. ,5,0.872
"location of the hotel is perfect, near KLCC and Pavilion. I got upgraded to a better room due to overbooked. King rooms are very spacious and clean. However i found clothes from previous travellers (boxer and tshirt). Housekeeping doesnt do a thorough checked on the rooms. Overall good hotel.",4,0.9093

"Disappointed with non-refurbished rooms #527 &amp; #529. Rooms &amp; bathrooms were “tired” &amp; not very clean - visible dust on bed lamps. I had stayed in November and the room was excellent! Despite earlier request, we had lower floor rooms and could not see fireworks - disappointing for my son who is an invalid on wheelchair. The pasta meal at wine bar was good!! Staff courteous but spoken English needs improvement for foreigners. ",3,0.8295

"Stayed there for six nights and had a lovely time. Upon arrival we requested reception staff if they could give us a room with views and they did even thou we had paid for a cheaper room. Excellent service, the staff we all very helpful.  Which made our stay more enjoyable and nice. Would highly recommend",5,0.962
"Can't fault the location. It is indeed excellent - in the heart of city centre, close to twin towers and the main big malls of KLCC including The Pavilion. The best part of it all is that it is the only hotel connected to the malls and other streets by an air-conditioned convenient walk-way.  The property is otherwise aging and not the best in terms of maintenance with broken tiles in the shower etc. Even the towels were worn out. The check in took a while as the rooms were not ready by the appointed time of 2 pm. The staff at the reception was not very welcoming but then may be it was due to the workload pressures of the holidays season.    Okay for food.",3,0.7151
Pros: excellent location. Room with view over the Petronas Towers. Nice room  Cons: bathtub plug not working had to have someone to fix it( had the same problem in another room in October) Some of the receptionists from the club lounge are really not pleasant. Food selection for the evening cocktails: very good but as soon as it starts it’s over!! I have never seen a hotel lacking in food! It was shocking! The answer of the chef was: this is not the Shangrila.  ,4,-0.4959

Stayed at the Impiana for a couple of nights and it was great.  The room was very clean and spacious and had all the trimmings of a 5 star hotel.  The bed and the pillows were particularly comfy. The pool is lovely and there are lots of loungers.  They said there were renovations happening but didn't see or hear anything myself (we were on 16th floor) My only criticism is that the hotel was full and breakfast was a bit chaotic..,5,0.2724
Impiana KLCC is located at a strategic position. Covered link bridge to both Suria KLCC and Pavillion. It was raining a few days when we stayed there but we were completely dry because of the bridge. The rooms are large and well maintained. The concierge and the doormen were friendly and always smiling. I enjoyed my stay there.,5,0.9468
"The hotel was surrounding with all other 5 star hotel, location was excellent. Service is equal to other 5 star hotel. The staff are super friendly and feel Welcoming.

In short, needless to list the great service and facilities of this hotel. ",5,0.9837
"My room is in the fifth floor, I’m very unsatisfied with the room housekeeping. Dust is every corner of the room. The sound proof of the room also very poor, you can hear the sound of someone drill the concrete from inside the room. If there any maintenance, hotel management should notice the guess during the checked but there was no any notice from management. ",2,-0.7178
