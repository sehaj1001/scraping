"I had an amazing stay! Rooms are spacious, awesome and bed is very comfy. I had a view in my room facing the Petrona Towers, that was fabulous! There is a giant pool that i didn’t get to enjoy, however i enjoyed the gym that is also huge! Staff is very kind and very lovely. Hotel is well located. Walking distance from Petrona Towers!",5,0.9851
"We stayed in the hotel two years ago and were really impressed, but now a little disappointed. The Club level rooms are a little more expensive but we think the quality is worth the extra expense. The rooms are large well appointed with a large comfortable bed, sofa, and desk. The club level has a lounge which is available all day and serves snacks and drinks at the appropriate time of the day. Breakfast can be taken there, although it offers limited choice so many club guests use the main restaurant, and here lies our disappointment. Previously the hotel restaurant was large opulent with a very wide range on international cuisine for breakfast. This has now gone replaced by the Evolution restaurant, which in my opinion does not meet the required standard. Why? It is really a",4,-0.552
"I stayed here for two nights from 28FEB-01MAR2020 and was really frustrated by the experience. Before arriving I was notified in the Marriott Bonvoy app that we had received a suite upgrade. We arrived and it took well over 10 minutes standing at the desk to get checked in. During check-in no one thanked me or otherwise acknowledged my Marriott Ambassador Status...strange. Then we got to our room and realized that it was not a suite. I assumed that there was some kind of computer error that caused the check-in delay and room downgrade so I called the front desk and explained. They apologized and said they would put us in the suite as planned...but that took 35 minutes.  Even though we eventually got into a very nice suite, there were many other problems. The guy who checked us",3,-0.4939
Very good service and nice Hotel. Swimming pool very big and nice pool bar.  Rooms are clean and huge bed.😊 Breakfast 10+ Also gym was good and there was sauna and jacuzzi. It was nice to go relax after training.,5,0.9669
"This is an old hotel, but the rooms have been very nicely and recently updated. My friend and i had a twin room that was spacious, with a lounge and work table. plenty of space for hanging clothes and shelves. wonderful 'block-out' curtains. The bathroom was a good size with large shower and full bath and a large round 'light-up' mirror. The pool is huge with plenty of shade and a large bar area. We had access to the the Club lounge where the staff were lovely. Always happy to greet us and make sure we were comfortable. Easy access location to many things, monorail and free bus service across the road, the lrt (light rail transit) station only 5min walk. The staff certainly made our stay memorable for two Aussie ladies and we would happily recommend this hotel.",5,0.9964
"This is my first time experience check in to Renaissance Hotel Kuala Lumpur. Before this i always check in to Renaissance Hotel JB and i am satisfied with their services. Actually i am quite afraid to check in here at the first place since this hotel was built in 1996 ( Very old hotel ). But when i step inside the hotel lobby, all the feeling totally change. 360 degree. This hotel is really look luxurious with the marble finishing, the chandelier looks very nice and luxury.  For your information, this hotel consists of 2 wings ( East wing and West wing ). But one wing have been closed for renovation and will be opened soon.

"Located at the cross junction of two busy roads in the heart of KL, the warming, dark brown hotel exterior welcomed us into a cool, pleasant hotel lobby with grand marble flooring and hospitable staff. Check-in was quick, and complimentary water infusions were available to quench our thirst. The rooms are clean, comfortable and come with both bath and rain-shower. There are toiletries, 2 bottles of complimentary water,  tea/coffee facilities and a mini-fridge to chill our own food/drinks which we brought back to the hotel during our travels around town. The usual contents in the mini-bar can be made available at the listed hotel prices if we so wished by simply calling down to the front desk using the room phone, similar with the in-room dining facility. One thing to note is",4,0.9702
"The hotel is in a superb location, close to everything worth seeing and close to district that has pubs/bars etc.  All facilities are good, room was spacious and well appointed. All staff polite, cheerful and attentive.  The only downside was the breakfast experience,  a bit of a rugby scrum, too many people in too small a space. Not sure what the hotel could do to rectify it though. All in all a very enjoyable stay.",4,0.9291
"it was a very nice place to stay when visiting Kuala Lumpur. It was closed to Twin Tower and other shopping center, especially trains liked to KL Sentral. Breakfast was nice because there were varieties of choices. Highly recommended!",5,0.8922
"Ideally placed for the MTR and the Petronas Towers this hotel offers everything you need.  Breakfast is great, both western and Asian on offer. The Club breakfast offers a scaled down version, but is equally as good. Rooms have been modernised in one tower - the other was closed under renovation - but this did not effect us. Huge pool, with ample sun loungers and a good selection of drinks on the pool bar menu . Lots of restaurants within 10-15 walk. Great lobby bar for a night cap. Not just a business hotel, good facilities for the leisure traveller.",5,0.9655
"This hotel is not one of the new ones and it definitely feels dated. The typical clientele are not exactly the elegant or fashionable traveller. I had to request a room change as the adjoining room was packed with people, having a huge shout talking festival with Skype on full blast at 11:30 pm. The hotel eventually found me another room. The breakfast is very good and the pool is humongous. The service at the hotel is very kind, personable and efficient. The staff are top shelf. Not sure if I’ll return but if I do, I’ll insist on a non-adjoining room. ",4,0.7955

"My husband opted for us to stay at this hotel along with my 2 year old son. The location is brilliant it’s not far from the Petronas towers. We stayed for 10 nights No problems at all I loved the lighting in the bathroom. The room was a generous size. And oh my the king size bed we so miss that! Staff were superb and friendly. We loved the access to the club lounge. It made life easier with a child to be able to have access to food and drink throughout the day. The breakfast buffet had such a huge range of foods, there’s something for everyone. I opted to have breakfast in the club lounge because it was quieter and more relaxing. Overall our stay was very Pleasant and enjoyable.If travelling with children this hotel is a must. They also have a playground with slides and swings",5,0.9829
"Let's start with check in a bit hit and miss which desk to go to especially when lots of people around.  Hotel not spectacular very much same as average 3/4 star lifts wait an age for and at one stage had to wait over 20 minutes for one.  Room clean and tidy good size and bed very comfortable,bathroom clean but took some time to get plug to seal down on its position.  Coffee and tea available but with powder milk would have been nice if fridge had the water in it with some milk.  Went to pool area very tired leaves branches all around the edges sun bed very filthy advise getting 2 towels each so as not to lay on bed.  Pool bar person came and went so again waiting for drinks.

Hotel from outside looking a bit tired but inside is well kept , clean , easy to move around. I like pool area there with staff serving drinks etc very good .also we check out after 12 and noone chase room giving call from reception what is good habit ( very often when I stay in hotels they troubles you with calls around check out time to vacate room )  Very good experience overall , would recommend and will come back .",5,0.9837

"We spent 6 nights in the hotel staying on the R Club floor. From the check in until our departure the service was excellent with friendly and helpful staff everywhere. The lounge was very good with good breakfasts, afternoon snacks and an newly extended cocktail period with different and interesting  food each evening. An excellent gym, great pool and hot hammam and sauna there was never much need to leave.

I was going to stay a week ended up with 2 nights. Hotel was not that great. Very noisy even with my room on the executive level floor. Part of the hotel is still closed for renovation. Breakfast downstairs was not good. Gym was fine but the men's locker room is old and needs updated. I was not happy with this hotel and checked out. I went to the le Meridien which was truly a great hotel.,2,-0.8193
"We stayed here for 3 nights on the club level.  Our room was spacious and spotless with a large bathroom and a fabulous light all around the mirror, great for make up and hair, Lighting in rest of room could have been a little brighter but that is the only negative comment I have.  This hotel has a lovely pool with plenty of loungers and a pool bar and cafe serving good food at reasonable prices. The club restaurant was lovely, food excellent and drinks were great. We had to check out of our room on last day at 12 midday but were allowed to stay and use all facilities until we set off for the airport at 8pm.  We would definitely stay here again",5,0.9847
"Thanks for providing excellent service. Staff members are lovely. Hotel room was clean. Toiletries were always perfectly reloaded. Breakfast is unbelievable delicious. Japanese -Chinese -Indian -Malaysian and European -American people feel like home. Everyone can find their favorite dishes, big variety and the vaitors are happy to help. Coffee is unforgettable. Loved so much this place.",5,0.9896
"Had a good stay experience. Was upgraded to club floor but sadly can't get my kids to join us for the breakfast.  Still thinking till now why all YTL hotels charge parking to their guests. Can't the hotel absorb the parking costs for hotel guests?  Rooms are clean and neat. Food was good. Staffs were friendly except there was one cook/chef at the club floor who only talked, greeted and smile to foreign guests and not local guests. Very sad with this kind of attitude.",4,0.9521

Our stay there was also an excellent experience, the staff were so  helpful and accommodating. Nothing was too difficult, from the ongoing correspondence, communication throughout the year to the meetings, food, hotel stay and ambience together with the warm and friendly hospitality provided by all. Special mention to Banu (Sales Manager), Wen Xin (Assist Event Manager), Bala (Banquet Manager) to Dimitra (Club Manager) and everyone who made our stay an excellent experience - Thank you.

"We loved everything about this hotel! We arrived very tired after an 18 hour journey to be given an early check-in and greeted warmly with a smile. We opted for Club access and enjoyed all the benefits that come with it. The rooms are clean, well serviced and comfortable. The staff are friendly, attentive and good at what they do. Breakfast and all other meals are fantastic! The pool is great too! Great location opposite the monorail, green line free bus service to major KL city spots and walking distance to Suria KLCC shopping and a two km walk to the Pavilion. Opposite the hotel is the Malaysia Tourism Centre for trip ideas as well. Love this place and we really appreciated the staff. We will be back! ",5,0.9946
Location. Is terrific!  Breakfast buffet can’t be beat!  The hotel assigns two people to clean your room.    Each takes their shoes off at the door when they clean your room.  The one introduced himself and said “I’m your room attendant and am here to look after you.”  Wow!! What pride!  What service!!,5,0.942
"They were run out of rooms when I checked in (which I booked 6 months ago and already paid), a bit upset upon hearing that.  Thankfully one room was still available ""The Royal Suite"", the top suite in Renaissance KL. So I did get a dreamy free-upgrade, and ended up in a Two-Room+Living Room+Study+Kitchen luxurious suite.   The breakfast in the club lounge was okay.

The room was modern, clean, spacious and had all the necessities l needed throughout my stay there. The hotel is located in a perfect spot, which was really convenient. I also would like to thank Meor, who works at the Club Lounge. He made my stay extra special - what a brilliant and friendly man! I cannot wait to be back.",5,0.9841
"Staff is very friendly, rooms are clean and nice and not too small, but might be noisy if you are on a lower floor. Breakfast is not bad, either. However, while there is nothing really to complain about, compared with similar hotels in the same area, you simply get less for your money.",3,0.7842
"The hotel is still under going renovation which meant one of the towers was closed, not sure if this is a permanent thing but we had booked some time ago so were expecting more restaurants and bars.  We were not told this before we arrived or when we checked in  There was also a lack of atmosphere, the bar closed very early and the bar which was meant to be open later was never open.  The pool was also the same nothing going on!  Breakfast was mental if you weren’t there within 30 minutes of service started there were crazy queues, thankfully we had not pre-paid breakfast so went out instead.  We booked a suite which was a fantastic room, really clean and great value for money.  The food was good, just don’t order the steak, was good value for money, wine was very expensive, the",3,0.9823
"I stayed 4 nights in this hotel and it was my second time. The hotel is within a close walk (5 mins) from the Petronas Towers and KLCC Mall and within 1 min from the skytrain/metro. Also this hotel is close (short walk) to many bars and restaurants for in the evening. The rooms are spacious, the bathrooms are big too. The service is good, the rooms have everything one could expect from a 4-5 star hotel. For european standards I would rather say this hotel is a good 4 star hotel, but not a 5 star hotel. Which is OK, because the price is also not really a 5 star price. The hotel has a large pool. Note that due to the many high rise buildings you do not get much sun at the pool. The hotel has a very nice bar for the evening and also they have a tennis court and an above average",4,0.8988
We were greeted by a charming young lady who quickly checked us in and in less than 5 minutes we were in our rooms and suitcases delivered. We had the pleasure of going to the club level for drinks that evening and greeted by Mahin and Kiran who made us custom cocktails and made sure our glasses were full and came by regularly to check on us. It was a large area and only the two of them but they managed to provide EXCELLENT service. They came by our table to let us know it was last call and offered a final cocktail for the evening. The next night we visited again and again the service was outstanding. We chose to have breakfast in the main restaurant and it was a bit chaotic with so many people and with the coffee machine being broken more often than it worked but there was this,5,0.8933

After a long day flying from another country and 1 hours drive from the airport we arrived in our room 11.00 pm. Hoping we would be able to make we append the Bar Fridge to get some milk no milk no water nothing in the fridge at all. So we called room service and asked could we please have some milk sent our room as there is nothing here to coffee. When the bell boy arrived at our room with the milk he advised that we would that be charged for the milk.

The pool is very big and nice, just only no dusbin provided at the pool. We need to go into the change room to find one. I found out also, dusbin is very difficult to find in the hotel, at the elevator as well.  The deluxe room is very tidy and spacious. I love the king bed, it suits three of us. The bathroom is very big and nice. Love it.  Just only it happened when the TV was not functioning. Cannot turn the channel. Just only the hotel advertisement.

Everyone was friendly and SHAMIM from the Executive Lounge was superb! He was very helpful and kind to provide some tips and suggestions going around the city. The only downside but NO big deal at all was the other side of the hotel bldg was under renovation  so we didnt have the view of the Twin Towers from our room. We were happy tho with the KL tower view from our room. Thank you to all the hardworking friendly staff of Renaissance Kuala Lumpur!! And yes!! The breakfast buffet was superb!!",5,0.9865

"First off the hotel is pretty good. A Nice hotel with full amenities from tennis court, badminton court, pool and full commercial gym.  Hotel benefits from very central location.  The issue I have is that horrible restaurant on the 1st floor of the hotel. I should have guessed it was not good as it is mostly empty. I ate the worst food I have eaten in Asia at this place. They claim to be Mongolian, Turkish and Arab cuisine and as an Arab they know nothing of Arab cuisine or Turkish cuisine.  Their Turkish coffee is a joke, their kebabs are dry with a burnt taste. It was just horrible.  I do not normally review restaurants but I really want to do everyone a favour by letting them know that Malaysia has sooo many great food choices, don't waste your time with this one.",4,0.9454

We enjoyed afternoon tea 2.30 - 5 and also cocktails &amp; canapés from 5.30-7.30. Well worth the extra to have use of the Club lounge. You were served any drink you liked or you could go &amp; help yourself. The food was plentiful too - chicken satay, sandwiches, salad &amp; cakes.

Stop misleading people. Your site advertises a nicely lit up pool at night when in fact your pool closes at 7pm. Pool never lights up. Me and my family found that out the hard way. Your site even had the pool hours as 6am to 11pm until I pointed it out to you and you updated it. Pool hours was the primary reason we booked with you. Coming off winter in NZ it was essential we had a pool to cool off in after long days site seeing. I didn’t just have no pool to cool off in but I had a very upset 6yr old to console on days we didn’t get back to the hotel on time. Spoiled our whole KL trip. Your managers Mark and Ande weren’t much help either. Mark didn’t bother getting back to me after my complaint on day 1. While Ande offered me a discount on my next trip. Funny.

Our room had a small problem on Air Conditioner but staff could show high attention to our requests and solve this problem for us quickly which was good and appreciated. Other than this, overview of the hotel room is okay, modern, clean with nice restroom.   As for function rooms, the Ballroom, Meeting rooms, and Foyers are functional and big. Also, there are a variety of buffet line for Breakfast and Lunch with tasty foods.

This was for a birthday celebration, and Renaissance made it extra special for us. We were treated to balloons in the bedroom and a lovely sizeable cake and wine.  We stayed in the newly renovated wing for 2 nights. We were trreated to a personalised experience and the staff made sure we were well taken care of. There was a small issue with the lounge running out of one of the main dishes, but thanks to the quick action of Dimitra at the lounge, we received a personal plate of the great tasting fried chicken. The massge at the spa was also a nice experience - it was not too hard or too soft and was just right.  This stay was extra",5,0.9784

"With so many hotels to choose from in Kuala Lumpur it was hard to decide, we were very satisfied with our choice to stay at the Renaissance KL Hotel.  We were most impressed by the grandeur of the ground floor, the glamorous reception area and gorgeous orchid floral arrangement.  Check-in was quick as we had arrived at 9pm and was assigned a room on the 4th floor facing one of the main roads.  I had requested a room on a high floor and to be quiet, I was reassured by the receptionist that it was, but it wasn't.  I was concerned that we would hear other guests on the 4th floor accessing the pool, fortunately we didn't.  Traffic noise could be heard but did settle a little over night for a few hours.

Tatty towels, average restaurant (we so miss the other restaurant that is now closed), no newspaper which was part of the room cost, long wait for room service, the guy outside behind the desk in charge of transport etc was constantly on his phone &amp; didn't seem interested in helping, vacuum cleaner going outside our door on one night at 10pm.

The receptionist looked very not interested while taking the check in or was being helpful. Took the double room because I just wanted to rest after a long time delayed flight.

"1st visit there on 9 nov. Was nearly let down as I almost couldn't use my club Marriott voucher due to a miscommunication with the personnel who made my booking the day before.  Good thing for manager Irene who was able to make quick decisions to appease me. Furthermore, it was my partner's 50th birthday that very day, hence our outing.  IRENE was very professional and pleasant throughout. She even arranged for a surprise birthday song and slice of cake for my partner. She even sang with the crew.  Ambience was great. A very nice change from temptations.  Food wise, few comments like mango chutney was way too salty. No rice available at the malay dishes area. Plus the heater there was too hot.

We stayed in a Club Suite which was really spacious modern and stylish. We had access to the Lounge on Level 24 which was great to come back to after a day out and worth the extra if you use it. The pool was also another great place to be. Breakfast in the main area had everything, I could want, and whilst we didn't eat in the restaurant/bistro other guests told us it was good. Overall the hotel has a great feel, the staff are exceptional, always willing to help in any way, without getting ""too"" friendly. For me, 5 star hotels should be a special place to be. This one was for us.",5,0.9722

"The hotel was gorgeous. The service was impeccable. Very attentive staff. I checked in with two of my girlfriends so they gave us a room with a very comfortable couch (I love sleeping on couches) so I asked for extra sheets. When we left the room for the afternoon, we came back to the couch made up with sheets, pillows, and a comforter like a bed. Most hotels would probably have just left the sheets folded somewhere, but taking the time to do that was a special touch. Also, dining at the cafe downstairs was GREAT. Irene, the manager (I think) was so attentive and took our Marriott rewards numbers in order to offer us 10% discount on our food, which was awesome. And those of us that didn’t have the reward, she signed us up. Talk about service!!!!",5,0.9902

The hotel itself was also great with the hotel looking new and modern after the renovation.  Can only praise the whole experience. But it was the genuine friendliness that won us over.

We had access to the lounge in the west wing and this was a great place to use when coming back from a day out, before going out for the evening or when you returned from a night out for some quiet relaxation.  Breakfast was a wonderful choice of varied dishes from many different culture, it was great to have some of the same type of breakfast foods the locals would have instead of the full English.

Here are a list of things that need to be improved here:  - The hotel has no vibe at all.  Bar is always empty and you don't often see the restaurant busy unless the buffet is on.  Also, the decor is very 'clinical'. - Spa massage was not very good at all. - Red wine is served chilled in the restaurant no matter what wine you choose. - Found out when I was eating a la carte in the restaurant that a lot of the food is pre-cooked.  This would explain why when I ordered a noodle dish, it resembled a stew. - Mini bar was empty for my entire stay, so that wasn't really an option if I wanted it to be. - no air conditioning in the gym.

Hotels seem so very ready to grade themselves as 5*. This Marriott may be in a 5* location but my first breakfast was average and the coffee was really poor. I checked in yesterday and have 10 days here. Writing this review as a reaction to my first day.  I realise that these reviews are very personal &amp; contextual - I should be able to make a difference in my review between a small B&amp;B and a 5* Brand hotel. You make allowances &amp; realise there are differences. That has always been my mantra in these reviews (see previous reviews of where 'i'm coming from').

This hotel was OK and we enjoyed our stay apart from a few points.   The location is less than 10 minutes walk from the Petronas Towers which also incorporates the very fancy KLCC Mall. Closest public transport is the monorail with the Buckit Nanas stop about 2 minutes walk away. We didn't use it but at rush hour this looked absolutely packed; it looked horrendous. This connects to Sentral and the main metro area rail network.   The WiFi in the hotel is good and also worked in the area directly outside such as the driveway and all the public areas.

We stayed here for 2 nights recently after arriving a day late due to a cancelled flight from the UK. It was a nightmare to check in as we were arriving late Ben though we had contacted the hotel to inform them of this. After over 24 hrs of travelling you don’t want to face 20 minutes of checking in - both the reception desk person and the computer were painfully slow. No room upgrade for being a Lifetime Gold in their frequent stay scheme which was disappointing.  The hotel room was pretty good with a comfortable king bed and good sized bathroom. Whoever designed the bathroom did a bad job though with all that space - very little room to place your toiletries next to the sink and you have to bang your head on the mirror to brush your teeth!

Check in staff told me I was upgraded for Bonvoy Gold but the room turned out to be the one I booked. It is ok if hotel is full but telling a lie is not professional.  Club lounge informed to upgrade me when available according to hotel staff when I asked but throughout three days no feedback at all. Dishonesty and no followup!
