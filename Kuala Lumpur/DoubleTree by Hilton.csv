I stay with Hilton chain many times over the year and I like the Double Tree concept as good value and service.  For this hotel in KL its especially good if you are a tourist  as you can walk down to places like KLCC mall or Petronas twin towers ... you can also get the monorail nearby...,4,0.9042
"Just stayed at the Double Tree by Hilton for 3 Nights. The hotel is conveniently located inside the Intermark Shopping Mall where you can find Starbucks, Newsagents, Clothes Shops, Restaurants etc which is very useful. I’d advise Visiting Grandmamas Malaysian Restaurant in the Mall. The food was amazing and great value for money.  The bus system seems a bit unreliable and sometimes stops at the hotel stop and sometimes it just carries on despite us flagging it down. Instead we made use of the  nearest metro station (Amang Park) which is accessible from the hotel via a pedestrian walking bridge. Go to the Watsons Shop in the Intermark Mall at Hotel to Purchase a Touch and Go Card. This can then be used on all Metro Lines and Buses and avoids needing correct change. Each Metro",5,0.8748

"I stayed for 1 night in King Deluxe Suite at Doubletree by Hilton KL for my birthday and it turned out to be one of the most memorable experience I had! The staffs were so lovely for surprising me with 2 birthday cakes! The room was also decorated with balloons even upon our early check-in. They even reserved a breakfast table for us and surprised me with a cake and birthday songs!  The living area was spacious with dining table and a comfortable sofa. However, there was a slight mistake on the qibla direction as I measured it using MuslimPro apps on mine and my friend's phone in the hotel. We already informed the staff regarding this and they will surely fix the issue.   The bedroom was great with a comfortable mattress and the plenty of pillow choices from pillow menu. The",5,0.9691
"As soon as we arrived at the hotel I had to get the cleaners to our room. Floors had not been vacuumed and in the bathroom the previous guest had had a proper shave and all the hairs were still on the floor. It was unbelievable that this was not cleaned up and when I moved some things in bathroom like the bin and a scale, more and more hairs would appear. It was cleaned immediately and thoroughly and I also received an apology. I would have left it like that-mistakes happen, I get it. But sadly cleaning standard during our stay remained poor. Especially the vacuuming, which was pobably done once or twice during our week long stay. There were also hairs everywhere, even between bedsheets and clean towels and since we are a family of 3 blonde Europeans we could tell those black",4,0.4215

"If any one looking to cover maximum tourist place during a short visit to Kuala Lumpur then doubletree by Hilton is the best place to stay, one can walk down to places like KLCC mall or Petronas tower or KL tower... n other places r in 5-6 km radius.  Do book a room with bfast, to taste the local cuisine of Malaysia along with western and Indian cuisine. ",4,0.7717
"Stayed for 4 night Feb 2020.  The hotel is located in a co share building with a shopping mall and offices, which is great as you have a choice of quick eateries if you need them.   There is a pool, which gets the sun but does have limited loungers, but we managed for the 2 hours we took out of touring one day to relax.   Great restaurant for breakfast - Makan - with a wide range of choices.   15 min walk to Petronas (1km door to door) and 5 mins to the under/overground if you want to explore further afield - please use it, really good value!  We had an exec room, floor 33, and used the Lounge everyday. Ash and the whole team made us feel very welcome and he couldn’t do enough to make sure we were looked after. He gave us recommendations for food, drinks, places of interest and",5,0.9884
"We stayed here three nights and the hotelmis inside a small shopping mall. The rooms aren't exceptional but the access to Petronas twin Towers and KLCC is excellent. The mall itself has some nice dining options including italian, Dome cafe and some amazing bubble tea outlets not to forget local Malay cuisine. I would go back for the great price i got and terrific connectivity to Petronas twin towees, Suria KLCC and even Bukit Bintang",4,0.9813
"Great located at the center of Kuala Lumpur. It is nearby to a number of attractive 'must visit' places such as KLCC, KL Towers, Pavillion Shopping Center, National Museum, National Library and many more. Hotel room is nicely decorated with all necessities provided. Food at Makan Kitchen is yummy with a number of local delicacies, and it is a must try restaurant. Staff are friendly and well trained to assist and handle hotel guests' requests. However, upgrade was not allowed even the hotel was not running at high occupancy, moreover, I am an HHonors member. This brings a bit of disappointment.",4,0.9423
The DT KL is a reasonably solid offering by Hilton and a pleasant hotel to spend some time at whilst in KL.  We especially enjoyed the service and amenities of the Executive Lounge.  The staff in the lounge were very nice and left a good impression of Hilton overall.  Ash the manager of the lounge is a very pleasant gentleman and made us feel very welcome.  We really enjoyed our time spent in the lounge.  Our Executive room was also nice.  I do agree with some reviewers that the hotel is showing its age and some renovation in parts (some new room furniture) would make the place even better.  We took breakfast in both the Executive Lounge and the main restaurant and both were good.  Service in the main restaurant was attentive and the selection of foods very good. Reception and,4,0.9898
Had the booking done via the general manager so i got an upgrade. Hotel facilities were good. Location too... Would recommend the Italian restaurant....food was amazing.... Staff was cooperative Overall good stay .,5,0.8074
"The DoubleTree by Hilton in Kuala Lampur is one of my favorite Hilton hotels in the world. The staff is exceptional and the hotel itself is beautifully maintained and lit. I originally chose the hotel for its proximity to banks, offices and embassies I needed to visit. The location of the property is convenient to public transportation as well as an easy Grab (Malaysia's equivalent of Uber) or Taxi ride to the city's many landmarks. I walked one mile back from the train that took me to the foot of the famous Petronas Towers to the hotel. ",5,0.8934
"I stayed twice for five days in January. Both checked in at the executive lounge and their service was perfect. I was faced with small problems during the stay, and I was very impressed by the hotel's immediate response. I visited here with my 4-year-old daughter and I was very grateful to all the staff for their consideration and affection for her. During the stay, my little girl turned 4 years old and I almost cried since the Lounge members throw us a small surprise party for her birthday.  The hotel’s biggest advantage is  its location, with a wide variety of restaurants and shops (even the supermarket) located in the Intermark Mall and all the tourist attractions in Kuala Lumpur within a short distance.  My family and I are also planning a trip to this hotel to enjoy a",5,0.9665

"I stayed in Doubletree for business for 3 weeks and then my family joined me for holiday in the last week. Doubletree staffs were very nice and helpful. I made multiple bookings due to plan changes, but the staffs managed to sort our everything so that I didn't need to change rooms multiple times.  The executive lounge staffs were exceptional. They made my month long stay much more comfortable. Well done! ",4,0.9213
"I would say the ultimate reason we come back again is because of great service, and warm greetings the Executive Lounge staffs. Unbelievable extraordinary service from Smital Shah (Direction of Operation) who met us during our stays instead of busy schedules. We really appreciate it arrangement made by Shalinda.  The ever most wonderful moments coming to DoubleTree Hilton KL is when we are being treated awesomely at the Executive Lounge by Shalinda, Ash, Azfar, Zarina, Ashikin, Stephanie, Putri  and Adib. All of them are very committed, hardworking, serving cheerfully from the heart without any expectations.

"This Double Tree lives up to the expectations from the brand. After a very long flight, substantial time-difference and with important meetings the following day, the Sleep Quality with a completely dark and silence room was excellent. Nothing like a really good night's sleep to set you right.",5,0.4274
"Stayed at this hotel for 5 nights as we have an office situated close by. Its very convenient and overall we enjoyed our stay here. The exec lounge is nice, plenty of drinks and an ok food selection, also helps that there is a small outside space to enjoy a morning cup of tea and over look the twin towers.  The makan restaurant is good with plenty of choice and always seating available. Pool area nice, not massive but adequate and a pretty decent gym. overall a good experience and we will be back when i work again from the area. Finally the cookies were well appreciated, especially by my daughter! Thanks. ",4,0.9814
"This could be my fourth review of this property from the first in 2011, and time sure flies because this once new hotel is now a middle aged dame.  On this occasion, a brief Christmas getaway with the family, I booked a King Suite to try out because this property has a strict no-upgrade to a suite for Gold/Diamond members - even if we book the highest category before a Suite.   The standard suite was comfortably spaced for a family of 4, about 1.5X the size of a standard room. ( Not 2X ), with a small dedicated living and study space. The connection from bedroom to bathroom had NO DOOR, which was not ideal, but the real deal-breaker for me was a sink which was lined with blackish mold.   I requested a room change and was quickly re-assigned a 2nd suite, which had no mold in the",3,-0.2742
Convenient location . On top of a shopping centre so was handy for meals groceries etc . Room was clean and spacious . Delicious buffet breakfast . Club lounge was adequate with a small selection of snacks and drinks from 530 .  Staff went out of there way to help us including late check out,4,0.8957
"Stayed one night at this hotel, travelling as a a family of 5, we booked two rooms interconnecting.  Price was very good and included breakfast for all 5 of us.  Check in and out was very easy and all staff involved where very accommodating. The rooms we had on the 17th floor had amazing views of the Petronas Towers. Breakfast is lovely offering Malaysian, Chinese, Western and Indian very very good coffee. The swimming pool is beautiful sparkling and very clean. The location of this hotel is fantastic only a few minutes walk to Ampang station, maybe a 5-7 min walk to KLCC, the hotel itself is located inside a mall that has everything from haircuts and nails,, restaurants to supermarkets. This hotel was great we were very very happy, have stayed in several other hotel in this",5,0.99
"This is a large, centrally located modern Hotel (Intermark Mall)  with an extensive list of amenities. Very customer orientated, staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful. On arrival the booking in was swift and welcoming . You even receive a chocolate cookie to welcome you. Rooms are spacious and the large king size bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. The purpose for our visit was to break our journey to Australia so we only had 3 days. If we had known how special KL is and the beautiful sights we would have stayed longer. We availed of the spacious outdoor   pool and 3 of the restaurants. In the Tosca restaurant by the pool we had anchovy and seafood pizzas costing a reasonable  (RM80 x2) washed down by a perfectly chilled bottle of Sauvignon Blanc",4,0.9811
"Upon arrival the staff were friendly and apologetic to the fact that they couldn't check us in early. They however provided us with a nice cookie and stowed our bags so we could explore. The Hotel was nice, beds clean and comfortable and the amenities well maintained. However the shower leaked excessively to the point it was a hazard in the bathroom. Staff were helpful with organising hotel to airport transfer.",4,0.9468
"We enjoyed our stay here from December 26-30, 2019. The cookie given to us upon check-in was a nice surprise. Also, the welcome drinks were very comforting after a travel and ride from the airport.  Took awhile for our rooms to be ready but DoubleTree staff were all nice and accommodating. I fondly remember Shalinda and Asfhar would assist us in the Executive Lounge breakfast, they are always smiling and ready to help. Their warmth and assistance means a lot, I remember the line in their TV video, ""thoughtful gesture means so much... there is a universal truth in small things they do."" Would love to go back to this hotel, plus mall - shopping and dining areas are just below your room. :) ",5,0.9935
"Stayed at hotel for 3nights and 4 days. The check-in process is fast and seamless. We got welcome cookies at the time of check-in.The rooms are spacious. Can sleep 2dults and 2children easily..The facilities are great too. The swimming pool water is a little cold. The breakfast spread is good. We had to face a queue to get into the breakfast area. The WiFi is fast too. The lounge is another amazing area. The lounge opens from 5:30 to 7:30 .They serve u alcohol and snacks which is limited.From one side u can enjoy the beautiful views of KL and Twin Towers.  The hotel is located on the first floor.

The best part is it is located in the Intermark mall KLCC where there are a lot of shops inside including, watsons, KFC, Mcdonalds, starbucks and a grocery store. Very Convenient. The hotel is well maintained, Fast check in and check out, and helpful staff. Will recommend this hotel to family,friends and travellers.",5,0.891
Stayed at the Doubletree for most of two weeks in Kuala Lumpur.  The staff in the Executive Lounge on the 34th floor was particularly good.  Staff personnel throughout the hotel were friendly and courteous. Rooms were spacious and clean. Hotel is next to a metro line with connections to most of the tourist areas in KL.  The Makan Kitchen was a great place for breakfast offering a great variety of ethnic and western foods.  Restaurant staff again were very good. The hotel was a great value for the price and we would be happy to stay again.,5,0.9872
"Again we chose this hotel for our break this year as we did during the last Christmas holiday. IDifferent from some other Hilton hotels in Europe, tthis particular hotel truly reflects a Hilton spirit and charachter. There was not a single negative thing that we could record. The reception manager was so nice and helpful like his other staff. However, we should highly commend all the staff in the Executive lounge for their high spirit of service and the smile on their face. Rooms are spacious and well furnished. Beds are comfortable. Breakfast is amazing in the Makan restaurnat. Wi-Fi is powerful and strong everywhere in the hotel. It is highly recommended. We are polanning to visit it again in the New year.",5,0.9907

"We stayed here for 2 nights in a twin room - the room was quite basic and a little small for a twin but overall fine for what we paid.  The hotel itself is in a shopping mall - we found it a little hard to see from the metro but once we were heading in the right direction all was good - even with 2 large suitcases!  The hotel pool is nice - and quiet when we visited, although it started to rain and they cleared everything away pretty quickly.  The pizza/pasta restaurant by the pool was nice - good pizzas and a pleasant atmosphere.  The executive lounge was quite nice - great views and the evening spread was simple but sufficient - with a good selection of wine and beer.  We got a great rate, and could see the towers from the executive lounge - to be honest we could not have",4,0.9951

"What a pleasant surprise. After reading the mixed reviews, we weren’t quite sure what to expect. However, we thoroughly enjoyed staying at the Doubletree in KL. It’s centrally located for tours and a short walk to a Hop On Hop Off bus stop. The hotel is inside a shopping mall, so we were able to take advantage of the money changer, massage/foot spa, supermarket, etc. We were in a nicely appointed room on an executive floor and had access to the executive lounge, where we enjoyed the evening drinks and appetizers (we skipped dinner every night because of this benefit). The Makan Restaurant buffet breakfasts were outstanding, with robust Western, Malay, Indian, Chinese, and other options. The hotel and restaurant staff are pleasant and seem genuinely happy to be there.",5,0.9838
"The lobby is great and neat, the room was clean. However, for a 5-star hotel, the room was just average, it lacks of the feeling of being extra and let the guest feel spoiled. The water pressure in the hotel is not strong enough. The location is excellent as it is located within the mall, which make having meals and shopping relatively easy. Will not do a second stay.",4,0.9201
"The hotel is located on top of Intermark shopping mall. Thus, it is convenient. Front desk staffs are well trained, served by Mr Nazri who are quick and efficient. Linen and towels are clean, soft and smile fresh. However, experience the worse breakfast at Makan Kitchen restaurant. Bad ventilation as after the breakfast you will smile like ""carry powder"". Suggest the management team to just sit there for 30 minutes and experience the moment of true. Skeleton choice of food.  At 10 am, only refill gravy for example, fish carry no fish, or chicken carry without chicken. The roti Chanai staff told me, the chicken is only for lunch. Observed long, long queue at fry egg corner. Fruits not fresh, especially watermelon is waterly and very sick looking. Yorguts served in big bowls",3,0.8363

"The lobby area is great and the hotel is neat, clean and efficiently run. The rooms are ok, ticking all the boxes, but lacks the feeling of that little bit extra that makes guests feel spoiled. You kind of feel on your own as they avoid cumbersome staff and processes. But perhaps that’s the style of this hotel brand. I guess because we were here on Christmas Eve we found breakfast a little disappointing. Not because of the food... that is great! But the seating placement. The second breakfast they placed my husband and me in the Chinese section at a very shabby 6-seater table. It kind of takes away from the romance of a quick getaway. ",4,0.9304

Nothing is more rewarding than being upgraded with free lounge access and breakfast for the two nights that I stayed.   I was first greeted by a piping hot cookie in the lobby. And then was escorted to the exclusive check in counter on the higher floor.  The staff at the lounge was helpful and friendly.  The selection of breakfast was stunning.  A must try for those breakfast enthusiasts.  The lounge offered filling and delicious bites during afternoon which could be your substitute for dinner.

The concierge, lounge staff and receptionists well met were all friendly and helpful.   As a Hilton Diamond, I was upgraded to a suite which was a good size and well maintained.

He is also extremely good at anticipated my needs.   I had been staying many hotels but this is the first time a manager come to greeted me among Hilton and double tree brands. My stay started with this fantastic acknowledgement by him.   I had access to executive lounge. I was impressed the service standards.

My flight was early and I have already placed a request for early check-in. Based on the availability they have given me the room at 10 am, 5 hours prior to the actual booking starts. As I was travelling with a kid, this was really helpful for me.  Rooms were decent with all modern amenities and Petronus Twin Towers was visible from my 26th floor. Room Staff were very courteous and  they could speak Hindi other than the local languages.  They have two restaurants. Breakfast was served in",5,0.8828
"friendly and helpful staff. ease of check in and check out. location is a plus as it is near to meeting place. very easy access to restaurant, food outlets and convenience store. unfortunately the pipe in the bathroom went bust at 4am, flooding the bathroom floor and disturbing my sleep.",4,0.7178
I stayed for a conference that My company paid for. I had requested early check in and was confirmed. I was with another attendee in line behind me. I was told they ran out of rooms. Guess what the other attendee got a room early and I was told they may find something in4-6 hours.  I pleaded that I am presenting and need to rest before activities began. I was told not possible whatsoever. I wonder how the other attendee got the room when she didn’t request early check in?  Clue. Skin color. I saw this attitude throughout my stay. The organizing team was able to get me a room within 30 minutes. Clue: gender.  If they didn’t have a room where did all those room came from when a guy asked who wasn’t even in charge.   Room was OK overall. However the AC didn’t work. The technician,2,0.4466
"Overall hotel service has downgraded compare to last two years until mid this year,   some of the staff at executive lounge and front desk staff have no motivation to work.. food quality of the room service in inconstant  nonetheless, great service at Tosca is consistent (thumbs up!)",2,0.68
"We have just had another very enjoyable 4-night stay at Doubletree. This hotel is very friendly, has a very pleasant atmosphere and everywhere is always very clean and well-maintained. Also the location suits us well.  For us, the icing on the cake is being able to use the Executive Lounge, which has a wonderful team of staff. It is a very relaxing place to be although the food at cocktail time is not as good as it used to be.  We send our thanks to all at Doubletree and look forward to our next visit.",5,0.9721
I stayed for one night on a business trip and managed to cut my hand on a sharp bit of rusty metal when adjusting the shower head.  The fixing in the wall had split apart and gone rusty creating a jagged metal edge that’s perfect for slicing your hand open. ,1,0.8807
"Pros - nice view at executive lounge, especially sunrise - integrated with malls - walking distance to Ampang Park Lrt  Cons - most rooms doesn’t have a view, the hotel was built before Petronas Twin Towers and most of the room orientated to mountain side rather than city - had seen better days, very old bed sheets and beddings.. pillow is soft and not fluffy - old &amp; small tv but some room upgraded to larger tv recently - some room with weird smell - outdated breakfast restaurant and pool, need renovation - very rude front desk manager - GM only care to reply good reviews here  Tips - if you are HH member, stay here if other Hilton portfolios way too expensive.. otherwise it is better to stay at other hotel chains nearby at same rate but newer &amp; better views.",1,0.9218
"Stayed at this place for the first time for out annual ocbc cycle KL outing on 23-24 Nov 2019. Smooth check in. Front desk gave each of in the queue a large cookie (choc chip with nuts, warm freshly baked) to munch while we waited. Very brilliant idea to give a good first impression and experience Room was great. Food options on the retail podium section is wide with many choices ranging from macs to restaurants. The bike storage arrangements is convenient and efficient. After our ride on Sunday 9 plus we checked in our bike back to storage followed by quick shower and headed for buffet breakfast which serves till 11am jusy nice for us late comers. I will come and stay here again when I'm in KL next time. Cheers. ",4,0.9652
"I'm a Gold Hilton Honors member and this was the first time staying at the DoubleTree KL.  I booked the room on Hilton's website and paid for it with a credit card which was charged a month prior to the stay.  However, at check-in, reception insisted that they physically verify the card, which I did not bring. I did not (and still do not) understand why there is an absolute need to verify the card when they had no issues with charging my card prior to the stay. I offered to log into my card's mobile app for them to verify the number but this was rebuffed.  Their solution was for me to pay with another card and they would refund the charge back to the card originally used. Normally, this would not be an issue for me, but as I was chasing a substantial reward (based on expenditure",3,0.8934
"Me with my family from india came for a vacation at Kuala Lumpur. We chose Double Tree by Hilton to add an extra level experience to our stay. We had delicious breakfast and dinner today in the Makan Kitchen. Amazing food with great hospitality. Would not forget to mention the real highlight which was the incredible staff, especially Mr. Harsh from India at the dinner. He treated us just like we are a part of his family, at the same time he was very professional and courteous. We would love to visit again as everybody greeted us like royalty.",5,0.9784
"I visited KL with my family of 5. We had a lovely time staying at Doubletree by Hilton. The staff is very understanding.  They do a lot of variety for breakfast at Makan Kitchen. Although, there was not much choice available for vegetarians but @Devansh was a saviour. He would place special request with the chef at Makan kitchen to prepare vegetarian dishes for all of us. He did his best to make us feel comfortable at the breakfast, every morning. He is very hospitable. I wish him all the luck for his future. The hotel also houses the Intermark mall.  The pool side is aesthetically beautiful and has a good bar by its side.  This hotel is highly recommended!!  Travel date- 03/11/2019- 06/11/2019.",4,0.9903

My husband was very happy with the high floor room the view was so good &amp; he was taking plenty of lovely photos.The executive lounge was very good they changed the menu comparing to two years ago &amp; better choice canapés  &amp; snacks. We used the lounge for our entire stay &amp; we liked change of the menu. We like to thank Ash, Azfar, Zerene, Stephani &amp; the rest of the team for their excellent service.

"Well situated above a shopping mall, close to Petronas Tower and with good public transport nearby, the hotel is all that you would expect -excellent, speedy check-in and out, spacious comfortable rooms, with all facilities working well, good breakfast choice ( poor selection of western cold items, though) etc. However,  a) the lift/elevator service was extremely slow - 10 minute waits even at non busy times were not unusual b) decor in public rooms and my bedroom is becoming tired. Despite the ""average"" rating, I shall select this hotel should I visit KL in the future.",3,0.743
"I was here with my team, to decorate Makan Kitchen for an event last week and i had no idea how to go to makan kitchen as it was my first time being here. my team had arrived first and i came later with all the decoration stuff and got lost searching for the lobby. Fortunately i bumped into this girl in front of the lifts named Natalie and not only was she very helpful to guide me until the restaurant, but helped to get all my stuff from the parking to makan kitchen as it was very heavy. I understand that she looked pretty occupied but still tried her best to sacrifice her time just to help me. Its nice being treated with sincerity every now and then.

"Doubletree by Hilton Kuala Lumpur offers both convenience and high levels of service for a city centre hotel which is located within a 15-minute walk from the Petronas Towers.   Check-In was easy and fast, I am HHonors Gold member so had the option to check in online prior to my stay however just waited till I arrived. I was pleased that one of the two rooms I had booked got upgraded to a executive room meaning that we had executive lounge access as well as early and late check out if availability was there. We also got our Doubletree cookies which are always a lovely touch. Luckily we checked in at 10am and they had the non-upgraded room available which was a bonus, The upgraded executive room was available at 2pm which was not a problem.   Both rooms were spacious and had",5,0.9626

I would highly recommend it.",5,0.9778
"Welcoming visitors at Hilton Hotel Intermark Mall, staff are inspired by friendliness and support which continued through our nine day stay (four then five days). The Careline personnel are particularly commended for patience and professionalism.  However the hotel is marred by material issues from the minor (legs detaching from the portable room light) to the major (lifts shut down 'periodically'). Of considerable concern are bathroom sinks where in both our rooms taps were positioned in such a way that much water flows on to the surrounds/ floor not into the basin (please see attached photographs). This failure in alignment creates a less than comfortable wet environment needing negotiation. Advice: the Hilton warning ('Floor Slippery When Wet') is absolutely appropriate.",3,0.9248
"A very nice place to stay with superb variety of breakfast buffet. Customer service from accommodation n Makan kitchen at top notch  Special thanks for a waiter named Harsh from makan kitchen for making my 3 kids very happy during the breakfast!  As for maintenance, i do think something can be done better. But nevertheless, there is no weird smell from toilet.  Definitely will come again. Such a plesent stay!",5,0.9582
This place is getting worse and worse..  After more then two years time ( see my previous report) Elevators still not working properly..  Sauna/ Steam room out of service for over one month...  Rooms are not properly working .. roller blinds..   How can you give out rooms to guest when they are not 100% ok?  How can they fix the rooms when guest are staying there ( note/ print out  seems to be old)  The room was also Not very clean.  The request of a room change was simply ignored.  This place seems to have a management / Maintance Problem.  Sad this used to be a nice hotel..,3,-0.8948
I use this hotel as my go-to accommodation in KL whenever there for business.

"I booked two rooms for my family and stayed 3 days from Oct 28th to 31st. Rooms were extremely spacious and comfortable. Staff are all so courteous and we felt safe and home. Breakfast is plenty and 3 days won't be enough for someone like me to savor every nice and mouthwatering dish they have in the breakfast spread. Actually for  breakfast they had different selections based on countries their guest are from. I had Indian as well as all other country dishes too. I got an apology compliment with strawberry and chocolates for late delivery of my luggage to my room.  The only negatives were bath area tiles are little slippery and floor mats should be layed outside toilet and toilet doors once got locked from outside.

However when ask the counter staff about booking a room straight from hotel.was told that hotel was full and no rrom available. However i managed to book a room via agoda.  Approached the same staff to check in using the confirmation letter from agoda. I was told to wait for 30 mins or more for the booking to flow in to the hotel.

"Like all places in KL, the service here is excellent. Breakfast is also fantastic, and khayril gave it a personal touch. The rooms are quite dated now although they are clean and spacious and beds are comfortable. The big downside is that there is a smell in the rooms (we stayed in four different rooms and all had this smell to greater or lesser degree); ask for a room with city view (some face tower blocks, not pretty) The hotel is in a (pricey) mall with a large food court which is a bonus. If you can afford it, I would recommend staying closer to the towers. car parking is free but access is not easy.",3,0.8497
