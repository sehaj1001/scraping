"Decided a quick 1 night stay at St Regis Kuala Lumpur this month (March 2020) and it turned out to be the best decision.  Having previously stayed at St Regis Langkawi, my expectations were sky high. I received an email from Ms Sally Choo a few days prior to my stay, and I appreciated that. Many hotels don't do this anymore, which is a shame. She checked in to see if I have any requests and preferences to make my stay more comfortable.  Upon arrival, no one opened the main door for me, which took me by surprise. Fortunately, this didn't happen for subsequent entries and exits   I was upgraded to a Grand Deluxe Double on the 20th floor, with sweeping views of the city skyline with huge top to bottom windows. My butler Wei Lung came into my room to give a tour of the room",5,0.9324
"Pros: Staff are warm and helpful. Butler service is commendable and service always with a smile. Good location. Breakfast spread is generous and really high quality. Watch the sunset or catch a sports game live from the pool area, nice space. The cigar lounge is also another warm space for meeting with friends.   Cons: One obnoxious fella at the front desk. Pls keep to formalities, at best cheeky, at worst a bit like harassment. I asked for a box for packing and butler came with a somewhat poorly assembled, overused box. I appreciate the effort but I’m sure a brand like St Regis can produce a better quality box? Make an earnest attempt or offer a paid service - needed something reliable which will not fall apart in cargo.",5,0.974
"Birthday spa and boozy lunch at The Brasserie. The spa was perfect, as always. Lunch was delicious and service was efficient. The wine list is always interesting. A regular for us, and we'll certainly be back.",5,0.936
"A short stop to st regis for an afternoon snacks with my family on last weekend was something to be remembered. St regis kl is a stop with my family every now and now and then, beautiful decors with a large horse located at the lobby lounge was suprisingly huge. Sweets on the 3 stands was like a music to my palette as i am a sweeth tooth person and my husband and my mum loved the sandwiches served every time the service staff bring it to table.  An highlight to this dining place was ema the manager and her staff constantly stopping by to our table to make sure we are well taken care of, and no doubt they went above and beyond  with every  guests. Ema truly an asset repersenting st regis, her effortless smile and care shown to her guest is an example of how hotelier should be and",5,0.9783
"I have stayed at a few St Regis properties in Asia and the St Regis in KL keeps the reputation of this brand in tact.  The space is large and furnishing feels luxurious. As a Titanium Elite member, I was upgraded to the St Regis suite which was very comfortable and beautiful. There was a spa room in the suite and a wonderful bathroom that was fitted with floor to ceiling automatic curtains. I was also very impressed with the breakfast and prompt butler service and would definitely return to stay.  Thank you to Lucas and Stephanie for providing a good check-in experience, and my butler Vicky who took good care to make sure my stay was an enjoyable one. Appreciate the little touches and the chocolates at turn-down service! ",5,0.9884
"We stayed there for 10 days and really enjoyed the hotel. The pool and gym are very nice. The service is very detailed. Location wise it is quiet, and close to the central train station. Very convenient. It is just that there are very few good restaurants nearby. So you need to drive out for almost all activities. ",5,0.9221
"Just spent my Bday long weekend at St R.  Had a delightful &amp; memorable stay; staff was warm &amp; friendly generally, yummy breakfast (recommend the truffle omlette) and good-sized pool as well. As a gold elite member, Raj kindly arranged for a complimentary upgrade and decked out the room with “birthday” decos plus cake etc..  Many thanks! Special mention to Sally who looked after us during our stay. Highly recommended, St R standard.",5,0.9787
"My stay at St Regis KL was a brilliant one...the room service, the front desk as well as the butler attentiveness.But the game changer was Balvinder. He is the ambassador for St Regis front door. Meeting and greeting with a broad smile, he immediately put us at ease. He gave all the best advice for places to eat and get this... he even gave detailed opinions on places of interest and food...and helped arrange hotel transportation. His sincere care, gentleness and impeccable etiquette are exemplary of the St Regis Hotel brand. I have stayed at many of the St Regis hotels worldwide, and Balvinder has greatly contributed to making St Regis KL one of my favourite holiday destinations. Who would have thought that KL could be a place to go to relax and unwind... well, with the lovely",5,0.9883
My husband and I traveled to KL for the first few days of our Asian vacation. We were greeted with beautiful balloon bouquet and a yummy cake. We celebrate little things like anniversary of meeting and this 27. Natasha our customer service manager out did herself!  The hotel has impeccable service. We stayed in the Caroline Astor suite and what a treat. On Friday the hotel had a fun event at the pool and Crystal Bar- Tacos and Tequila. The St. Regis is well situated near the KL Sentral Station and the NU Mall.  While in KL this is the place to stay. ,5,0.9709
"A couple of weeks ago , we came to celebrate my brother - in laws post wedding celebrations for the iconic St Regis afternoon tea and i was thoroughly impressed! to start with the savory bites were bursting with flavour , especially the salmon tart and we were all thinking for seconds, thirds and fourths.  The desserts were some of the most delicious ones ive tasted to date. These inventive recipes were truly a  treat. Spending most of my life in England , I know a good scone and clotted cream and these scones were pretty close to perfection.  What stood out even more than the food was the hospitality that we received , Miss Emma to be precise and her team went above and beyond to ensure the event was fully catered for dietary requirements and made us feel relaxed and at ease ,",5,0.9867
I stayed here for 3 nights in February 2020 during the Coronavirus outbreak which meant that the hotel was very quiet.  I was upgraded to a suite when I checked in and the suite was exceptional - bigger than my Boston USA apartment!  The staff were incredibly friendly throughout my stay.  Pros  - Several options to choose from in the hotel to eat during the day and evening - The hotel arranged (at a cost) a limo service to take me to the airport when I departed - Excellent spa (Iridium) - Two rooftop pools with great views of the city  Cons  - Astor Place bar has a cigar lounge which means the place smells of smoke  - No ATM nearby! (closest was at KL Sentral) - Was a little formal / stuffy   Overall this was an excellent hotel and exceptional staff and I would definitely return.,5,0.9522
"I love to go to St Regis Hotel, the environment is nice to enjoy tea over there. Hi-tea is delicious and yummy !!! I bought 13 boxes from St Regis Hotel, because mooncake is not too sweet and mooncake design is nice and unique.",5,0.9612
"Amazing hotel, great and friendly staff. Wonderful breakfast experience. The Hotel is fantastic. Nice rooftop pool and bar. In room amenties are amazing. The bathroom is beautiful. Thebutler service is amazing. The only downside is the location. It is a little far from the city center, but is also very helpful about it and has shuttle service to the KL sentral station which is a very nice touch. Overall fantastic stay.",5,0.9842
"We stayed a few nights here over the Lunar New Year. I love how calm and serene the hotel is. It is very nicely appointed, the lobby, restaurants, room.   The breakfast is not bad but the coffee is tasteless. Breakfast service seems to be led by a wonderful manager. We received excellent service from him but elsewhere, we thought the service could be better. While the staff are mostly professional enough, we feel like there is a lack of warmth. There is a feeling of staff not knowing if they should greet us first or we should go first. The poolside service is barely there. They didn't lay out towels for us and we had to go into the adjacent cafe/bar to order some food and drinks.   We also found some remnants of food under our sofa on our first night. We like the room though",3,0.9878
"Stayed at the St Regis over the Christmas holidays. Beautiful lobby Christmas decorations, excellent staff, great festive buffets. The rooms are huge and beautifully appointed. I have stayed at many 5 star hotels in KL, this is one of the best. The only downside is the location, feels quite isolated from the big tourist areas.",5,0.975
I chose the deluxe bedroom because is comparatively cheaper and it's not too small. There are free drinks and a small portion of free sweets for us to enjoy. The only thing that is not too good is that every day we have to call the concierge to make up the room.,4,0.8908
"Location: the hotel is located in KL City Center near the central station. It is conveniently located for business travelers. Not much to do around the hotel (walking). Taxi fare is not expensive so getting to touristic attractions is no big of a deal and the traffic is moderate.  Room: I have stayed in deluxe room. The room is spacious and well maintained. Nicely designed &amp; decorated. The design of the room is very warm and cozy. Bathroom is huge and fully marbled. The room is equipped with everything you need including Nespresso machine. Despite some notable cleaning issues, the room in general  is clean.   Facilities: the lobby area is small and surely lacking the grand factor. Breakfast area is small too, thus expect some waiting time to be seated during high seasons. The",5,0.9501
I really loved this hotel in Kuala Lumpur. Great service and staff. The only issue I have with it and the reason I didn’t give it five stars was because the location. It’s not ideal for walking around. I will say I don’t get the feeling that there is a lot of hotels in KL where the locations perfect.  Other than that the hotel is perfect. The rooms were large and luxurious. But it was great. Staff was fabulous. My butler was lovely. Concierge was great. The shuttle from the train station was fairly straightforward. I definitely recommend this place to folks visiting in Kuala Lumpur. ,4,0.9882
"Location might not be the best compared to the other price comparable Marriott property. However , an extremely comfortable and luxurious stay . Good Marriott membership recognition, rooms were spacious , bed was fluffy and nice and service was amazing with most staff recognizing our existence with greetings. Regis will be my go to choice if I need a day to just stay in , rest and relax . Else , W might be a better choice . ",5,0.954
"We had stayed in a ""Grand Deluxe"" room for three nights. Our room was relatively large and elegantly furnished. One thing to note is that the sliding doors to the bathroom and walk-in-wardrobe can be quite dangerous so mind your fingers when closing them.  The service throughout our stay was excellent. The check in process was smooth and comfortable and we were afforded a very early check in as our room was already made. The St. Regis Butler team was a stand out as they consistently met our requests with a high level of professionalism. One detail I observed was that they all removed their footwear after they noticed that we were barefooted in the room and this experience was different to other properties we visited. They also served us some delightful macarons during the turn",5,0.9233
"This hotel is exceeded our expectation. We love the breakfast even not variety but quality. Besides, we love the small cookies during check in and  chocolate for turn down service. Probably due to Christmas season. On top of that we took their free shuttle car MPV to Nu sentral with every  30 minutes provided to guests which is a plus point if you stay here. Summary, everything is so quality from decoration in detail to customers service. ",5,0.9437
"Our stay in The St Regis Kuala Lumpur by far is One of the BEST Hotel experience we had. We stayed on 17 to 19 dec 2019 for 2 nights in a Deluxe Double Room with 2 Queen Beds.  Huge bathroom with 2 vanity sinks. A huge bathtub which could fit 2 person. A small TV in the bathroom which we can watch while relaxing in the tub. A smart toilet which comes with heated seat. Sensor to auto open and close the toilet bowl cover. Adjustable bidet. Comprehensive toiletries, lotion, shavers and shaving cream, bath salts, facial soap and etc.   A walk in closet perfect to stow our luggage and ample storage for clothes etc with a huge mirror. It makes the room less cluttered as all luggages aside.   Bed and pillows was heavenly. Manage to sleep well throughout. The atmosphere is very quiet",5,0.982
"I stayed here for a night. The check in process was unsatisfactory with a long wait and I finally got the room after 3 pm. The check in staff wasn't friendly and appeared impatient when I asked questions. I duly gave my feedback to the duty manager and she apologised and the service improved.  Room was very classy and the bed was comfortable. Unfortunately there was no access to the steam room and jacuzzi unless you purchase a spa treatment. Pool looked big and inviting. The buffet breakfast was small but with very high quality food and ingredients. St regis is a good choice if you are after a spacious, elegant room. The service can be hit and miss at times. Location is also not the best compared to other competitors. ",3,0.6099
"We stayed at the St Regis at KL Sentral from Mon 16 Dec to Wed 18 Dec in room 808. We would like to personally thank the amazing butlers, staff and wait staff particularly Omar, Deva and Yehezkiel and all the chefs and their respective teams who accommodated our multiple request for gluten free meals to cater to my 8 year old daughter and husband’s strict dietary needs. You truly went above and beyond on most occasions to make it a memorable stay. Hands down the best luxury hotel experience for our family of four in Kuala Lumpur. We will definitely consider it for future visits.",5,0.9741
"Located at KL Sentral, 8 mins walk to the KL Sentral station where you can take MRT and KL airport express; then you could avoid traffics in KL. Impressive room, very spacious, King size twin bed, comfortable one, with living area &amp; working desk! Mini-bar is the most amazing amenity in the room, with coffee machine, snacks &amp; drinks. Big wardrobe which leaves enough spaces for twin-shared! Strong shower, huge bath tub, washlet toilet; offers sufficient amenities for your stay. Just minor issue, there’re stains on pillow case &amp; bed sheet. Besides, receptions can be more friendly and welcoming to guests. Air-conditioning was too strong, freezing in room and also in meeting rooms. They said temperatures couldn’t be adjusted, either switch on or off. So, I turned off the",4,0.9757
"This is our home away from home. So far, St. Regis Kuala Lumpur has always been nothing but a stellar experience. I don't think I've been to a hotel throughout the years that has been consistently exceeding every experience I've had.  Elite recognition is amazing, service is amazing, and I am repeating myself like how I reviewed this property the last time I was here.  Gotta give credits to the butlers team. Their intuitive service is impeccable. And one thing special about this property is the amount of private art collection. Do ask your butlers for a tour. You’ll be surprised at how amazing it is.  Although there are some minor changes to the breakfast experience, it’s still pretty good. But I honestly miss the breakfast experience they use to have. That was one of the things",5,0.9913
"The hotel isn´t too big but offers guest a variety of amenities. It´s location isn´t great tho, a car is needed. The quality of all the services a up to St. Regis´standards. The rooms are spacious and have a cupboard specially for tea time! Great hotel!",5,0.9311
"A true 5 star !! The property is GORGEOUS. The Caroline Astor suite could not be nicer, from decor to amenities to the view and layout! We had a short but exquisite one night stay and the team there went above and beyond to make it special - from early arrival - with a great breakfast offer and good ambiance in their Astor Bar! Great property and will be back!",5,0.9775
Youll be hard pressed to find a better hotel anywhere in the world.    As a Platinum Elite level member I was upgraded to a Suite.    Food was excellent.  Hotel was clean and luxuriously decorated.  Kudos to front desk Manager Natasha whom went above and beyond to deliver best in class service after a minor mishap that was 100% the fault of a Guest whom ignored the no smoking Policy.  I also arranged a private tour of the local KL area tourist spots with the hotel concierge.  Highly recommended.,5,0.9061
"I took my mum to Saint Regis today ( just earlier around 8pm) for some dessert , it was her birthday. Thank you to the wonderful team at the drawing room( 19 November 2019 ), the team really steeped up , from their service to gestures , it was indeed truly fantastic.  I must point out excellence when i see it and one of the staff, Jerry ( at the drawing room)  , I have to highlight  was an absolute delight , a true professional , from his choice of dessert suggestions to arranging the surprise for my mum ( which she had an absolute blast) , truly hats off to him , please do send him my highest gratitude and regards , truly a gem of a staff that that represents the world class recognition St Regis has to offer.

"Very colonial style hotel, with a very friendly staff. I enjoyed this hotel a lot because of the comfort and service. I booked the hotel limo service from the airport to the hotel. It took around 50 minutes and cost around  350 ringgit. By comparison, at the end of my stay, I booked a Grab car back to the airport and that cost around 70 ringgit. My room was a very comfortable room with a sofa in a living area and a very comfortable bed. The bathroom was fitted with a bath and a separate shower cubicle. I also had access to the butler service, but I didn’t make use of the service. The hotel is around 7 minutes walk to the Sentral station. Outside is a nice terrace area with a pool for guests. I didn’t have time for the spa services but I heard it was very good. Well worth",5,0.9708
"Probably one of my best stays in KL. Rooms are vast, modern and very well decorated. We got the afternoon tea served in our room. Was very nice.  Would definately stay there again if given the opportunity.",5,0.9097
"Having stayed at the St Regis on my last trip to KL, I didn’t think twice in booking again and was glad I did so.  The rooms are pretty much perfect - it made getting through my jet lag much more pleasurable.  Great views, high ceilings and impeccably appointed.  The Astor bar is fantastic also - a great nod to a gone by era.  The only thing that could have been better was service at the Brasserie for breakfast.",5,0.9802
"I recently had dinner at the Brasserie, St Regis Kuala Lumpur and food was great and service was impeccable. The butternut squash soup is light but served piping hot accompanied with croutons, Feta cheese and pieces of candied peanuts. A very clever and special combination that taste absolutely delicious. The Wagyu Short Ribs is so tender that melts in the mouth and the Gâteau Basque Fromage Frais is fantastic. The highlight of my dining experience has to be the attentive and wonderful hospitality rendered by the staffs and ambassador of the restaurant. Special thanks to Mr Alvin Yeoh and Mr Zain for making my dining experience the most memorable one. ",5,0.9905
"Met a Friend after a Year, He suggested let’s go for Business Lunch at St Regis, He wanted to had Steak, Well we did, from the time we entered the Restaurant, we were taken care of by Lovely Lively Staff, Very Attentive, Ambiance was Classy, &amp; Restaurant was not too crowded.  We ordered 2 Course Meal, &amp; Simply the food was delicious, be it Hummus with Meat Balls to The Best Steak ever I have had soo far, &amp; I’ve had steak at other St Regis Properties as well around the world but St Regis KL just took the Prize!  I’m surely coming back again.  ",4,0.9724
"I've been to KL for work quite often in 2009 -2010 and haven't been back until last week, forgot how beautiful KL was. Stayed at St. Regis for three nights, but I have to say it was the best three nights I'd had for long time. Big room, facing to the park, clean, great facilities, bespoke butlers and very helpful staff. DON'T HAVE MANY OPTIONS FOR breakfast, but good selections and quality. I didn't eat other things anyway, accept my normal egg white omelette and the noodle soup they have, OMG it's so good. THE MUST TRY is the Taka &amp; Ushi the Japanese restaurant on the third floor, a bit pricy for dinner but absolutely amazing food.  I love the city as well as this hotel, will definitely be back.",5,0.995
Love love this hotel! my first time here as recommended by my cousin. We booked deluxe double room but got upgraded to deluxe king room when they found out it was my bday. And I guess we came not in the peak season. There were complimentary hot beverages &amp; ironing everyday. how lucky I was that I can took a break from ironing my husband &amp; my clothes for this trip! hahah love it. Would definitely come to stay here again.,5,0.9753
"After hosting Haute Grandeur Global Awards for over 5 years and many other luxurious events all over Asia, I was truly impressed with the attention to details that the staff gave me during my hosting of the award’s gala dinner.   BIG applause to the Banquet Manager (did not see his name but the gentleman with glasses) who took great care of me making sure I had plenty of water by the stage, snack to eat before the show starts, that my water at the table was luke warm (which was superb because I did not tell them), that they prepared my courses based on my busy hosting schedule and that they DID NOT take away my dessert after all other tables were cleaned.  😃  This was truly attention to details and I am so thankful because I normally do not get to enjoy my dinner during",5,0.9908
"At St Regis upgrade is almost unnecessary as their basic room is more than adequate. Having said that I asked about upgrade as Bonvoy Gold habitually and was told the next grade up was unavailable. But when I checked online the next grade up was available in the afternoon and evening. The house manager gave an explanation that was incredible.  I was told of Butler service complimentary beverages. When I asked what those covered it turned out just coffee and tea already in the room. A bit misleading, almost false advertising.  The first evening snacks were sent to the room but nothing on my second evening.   Housekeeping removed the bathmat without replacement which makes stepping out of the bath a bit tricky.  I felt I should have packed more to fill up all the space.  The gym",4,-0.0544

All staff is very professional and friendly without being standoffish.  Rooms are large and tastefully decorated.  I was particularly impressed by Astor bar staff and breakfast staff.  A bar staff remember me from a year before which I find it very impressive. She made her special cocktail for me:)   The restaurant staff during breakfast accommodated my dietary requirements without prior arrangement.  This is definitely my hotel choice in KL given how easy it is to reach from airport but also getting to most part of KL but also the hotel and the staff being absolutely wonderful.",5,0.9641
"When I arrived at St Regis Hotel Kuala Lumpur I was immediately impressed by the decor and the attentive staff. When shown to my room it was a mini suite and very luxurious. The pool area is small with a mere half dozen loungers. When we went to have dinner in the main dining room they were hosting a wine tasting evening so no food for residents. Breakfast next morning was slow, even a fried egg arrived about 5 minutes after I had finished the sausages and bacon. I then had an event to attend and left the hotel at 2pm, when I returned, exhausted, close to midnight I was very disappointed to find the bed and room exactly as when I had got up in the morning.  Next morning breakfast again was so slow. I'd had enough. Checked out and spent my remaining 4 nights in Kuala Lumpur in a",3,-0.6868

From the hotel manager Nilesh to Natasha and Harry our concierge, I could not have asked for a better stay.  The Caroline Astor Suite is divine and the opulence of the entire property is breathtaking.  From tea in The Drawing Room to libations in The Astor Bar and breakfast in the Brassiere, no stone was left unturned.  However, the biggest standout is the sheer quality and attention to detail of the entire staff.  Look forward to returning soon.",5,0.9643
"The St. Regis Kuala Lumpur. My dream hotel to stay since they open its glamorous glass door in 2016. Only in 2019 my wish and my dreams come true. First impression when i arrived at the hotel lobby was super duper awesome. When i step out from the elevator and walk to the front desk counter, their staff already greet me from far and offer me to take care all of my belonging.  At the front desk during check in process, they give me welcome drinks (flower tea and hot towel) and also the welcome letter. Everything explain clearly by the front desk staff and after that the bellman escort me with all the belongings directly to my room.

Never stops thinking of staying back here again in the future!  Pro(s): 1. The Signage outside the road is sufficient.  2. Located at the heart of KL city, next to KL Sentral the main KL transportation hub. 3. During my arrival, I was greeted from the entrance with warmth and friendly staffs. They showed me the way to the FDA and FDA greeted me with non-stop smiles. Not forgetting the complimentary tea to lift up my mood. 4. Overall the suite we stayed on was very good. We loved almost all the facilities and amenities in the room. The interior of the room is a sight to behold. The furniture arrangement",5,0.9802
"It was our first experience at a St. Regis.  Location - not close to KLCC.  We had to take a taxi ride to anywhere we wanted to go.  Grand style and decor.  Room was clean and we liked the walk-in closet separated from the bathroom design.  We had breakfast and selection was very good (unfortunately, could not beat Grand Hyatt).  We did not dine at their restaurants except at the Drawing Room for afternoon tea.  A lovely spot with lots of natural light.  One major disappointment was that there were houseflies.  We used the pressing service once.  Due to urgency, I gave them 2 pieces but asked for 1 piece to be pressed and returned to me within the morning.  When the butler returned, she came with both pieces nicely pressed.  I was very pleased.  During the turn down service,",4,0.9516
"The St. Regis! The glitz and glamour! The shine is all there but not without shadows. The location is excellent so near to KL Sentral. The room was spacious and clean. The bed mattress was firm but comfortable. And the hotel staff always greeted us with a smile. However as polite as they were, we had to repeat our instructions on more than one occassion. Either the message was lost in transit or the staff forgot about it. This gives me a feeling that they are not very sincere although they give assurances that it would be done. However amidst these irritations, it is a hotel worthy of it's name. Just that I will lower my service expectations if I were to stay here again.",4,0.9597
"I do sincerely feel this is the best hotel in KL but I must qualify, this statement is based on a comparison of the hotels I have stayed in and based on my personal preferences. I have stayed in at least 5 other 5- star hotels in KL including MO and JW Marriott and the St Regis would be my winner in a shootout. Allow me to elaborate why.  Room Quality – The St Regis truly excels here. Perhaps it is because it is one of the newest in the city but all the finishes are of high quality and the room is spotless. Many hotels in KL, including high end ones, come across as dated and in some cases run down. Not the St Regis. In fairness, it is quite obvious that high quality materials have been chosen and no quality shortcuts were taken. The luxury is also well balanced. Quality, elegant",5,0.9839

They had our room decorated with balloons and rose petals.  Thank you to our butlers Duncan, Faizal and the whole staff too numerous to remember all your names but thank you! You made an elderly woman feel so welcomed and she had an amazing stay. She had an awesome high tea at the Drawing Room.  Our servers Darshni and Ray did an amazing job especially when her birthday cake / mousse came out.. My mother loved the ""Horse"" by Boticero. It was huge!! Lol.

I checked in really late on Aug 7th and the Front Desk employee escorted me to my room as I was a single female and there was another male guest who was going to take the same elevator with me and the male guest was tail gating me as the male guest did not have his key card with him. I appreciate the Front Desk employee’s due diligence to Ensure my safety.

"Good location near MRT &amp; short walk to KL Sentral so handy to move around especially during peak hours when traffic can be slow. Easy way to get to hotel would be to take the KLIA express train to KL Sentral. Hotel has shuttle from the KLIA arrival exit.

"If this report gets published - it will be the first time I have ever “reported” on the same place.  This hotel has everything - and nothing.  Three stays - 20+ issues.  There is a consistent problem with food, bar service and overall attention to quality.  But - at the risk of repetition - it is the people that let it down.  I want it to succeed.  I love KL.

"My family and I stayed for 2 nights in July, it was a joined birthday celebration for my father-in-law and myself, and the entire team at St Regis made it so special for us all!   First of all, the rooms were one of the best we've ever experienced in Kuala Lumpur. We took 3 rooms - one St Regis suite and and two Grand Deluxe Double. The suite had a living and dining area which was perfect for the birthday celebrations, and the grand deluxe was extremely spacious as well, with a sofa AND a walk-in closet complete with a vanity table with perfect lighting. Some 5 star hotels can be quite dark, but St Regis' rooms have such a cozy vibe because of the way the room is lit.

From beginning to end (even though i had to wait for 1 hour to get my suite ready) the staff were absolutely professional, friendly, and helpful.   The suite was clean and spotless;  Our butler appeared somewhere around 4pm offering us complimentary coffee and tea. We paged the butler several other times during our stay, and they were always there after a short moment.   The only drawback was the staff at the pool bar, we went to the pool around 430pm and he was not that friendly and the way he approached us was unacceptable.

The whole, less than satisfying experience,  left me rather disappointed and bewildered!  Allow me to relate my story. When I arrived at the Astor Bar I was amazed to note that it looked real nice and like a gentleman's bar should. It had a nice ambiance and comfy chairs to relax in. Four of my guests had arrived before me and had ordered their drinks.I was told that one of my guests had to wait 15 minutes for her Bloody Mary!

Secondly while the guest checking in on the next check in desk had drinks offered to them while I’m not, the tray was full of drinks by the way.

The suite had well appointed bathrooms with modern showers and fittings. Room service was good and we liked everything we ordered.  Strangely enough, the only somewhat negative feedback I have on this hotel, is with regard to the decor. The hotel is tastefully decorated overall, but I feel like a little more thought could have gone into this. I counted 12 copies of the exact same book in our room. Really felt like overkill. Even the bookshelves in the lobby are lined with the same set of books over and over again and after a few nights, the place began to feel a little impersonal.

Checked in again to the Caroline Astor suite, and we realised that it was literally the exact same room that we checked into on our last visit. Talk bout deja-vu, haha. Again, I have to highly commend the butler service. Requests are handled immediately, and almost no faults.

"St Regis is easily one of the best and most luxurious hotel you can get in Kuala Lumpur. It's newer than it's competitor like Ritz Carlton, another luxury brand under Marriott Bonvoy. The personal Butler service is probably their selling point and they never fail to deliver excellent service. Location wise can be a bit tricky. For those who wants somewhere near to KL Sentral aka Bangsar, this would be perfect. It's a little bit far from the main shopping areas like Bukit Bitang and KLCC but there's always taxi or grab car. I'll definitely stay here again if I decided to be around Bangsar area.",5,0.9406

It had a separate walk in closet, and the bathroom had double vanity with bathtub, rain-shower, and separate room for toilet.   Service is so-so nothing extraordinary.

"As a extremely frequent Traveller staying in hotels about 10 days a month, I know my hotel brands all to well.  I am typically more preferential to W Hotels as it fits my lifestyle and Tate.  But due to the W in KL being oversold part of my trip, I elected to try out St. Regis..  Wow! The room, property, art, service, dining was exceptional!  This is a new property with modern amenities. The art here which your Butler will inform you about is spectacular.  Kitt the head Butler is exceptional! She went above and beyond! Zuul my Butler was amazing!  I was blown away by the experience I had here!  There are a lot of nice properties in KL to stay at, but the St. Regis is worth every penny. A modern hotel blended with the rich history of the St. Regis brand!   I cannot wait for my",5,0.94
"I had a 2-night trip to KL in December 2018 before Christmas.  As first time staying in St Regis KL, I was not expecting much.  It turned out to be a nice surprise.  The decor, space, staff service, and food quality are all meeting the St Regis standard.    As Marriott Platinum Elite, we were upgraded to a Suite which is huge, and with a massage room ready.  The buffet breakfast was great, with plenty of varieties in nicely designed restaurant served by well-trained staff.    For two nights, we went to the Bar.  It was not surprisingly good in terms of choices but the ambience is relaxing and stylish.  The only thing I could say it's less perfect would be the location.  As we had our friend picking us up and sending us back every day, it was not such a big inconvenience.  But,",4,0.9722
"The hotel itself was perfect in almost every way. Room and service were impeccable. Deluxe room was large, brand new and wonderfully furnished and equipped, comfy bed and sitting area with great view, large bath room, and separate dressing room, very amazed for the value.   Anyway, location is not so central. Need some good walk to get to KL sentral and shopping mall. And there is nothing much to do around there. ",4,0.9661
"Visited Crystal Bar, creative &amp; delicious dessert #coconut &amp; pandan creme brulee + professional and cordial service #wan xin and her fellow colleagues. Surely will visit again, and it will be very soon.",5,0.8591
This is one of the best hotels in KL. The rooms is one of the largest in KL with ultra luxurious furnishing. The bathtub is huge. There is a mini walk in closet with a dressing table. Good variety of minibar and snacks available in the room.  You will never want go get out of bed in the morning!  The check in was swift and friendly. Breakfast is really good with good selections. I can’t find any faults with the hotel.   Will definitely be back for staycations! ,5,0.9625
"This is not located in the centre of KL but Short walk to some major attractions. Planetarium, National Museum. About 45min taxi from the airport. Loved this hotel- had all the frills. The suites where enormous, marble clad,  clean, luxe, the service was phenomenal. The breakfast buffet was a great selection of Western and malaysian. Plus free flow prosecco included. The facilities we're top notch, great hotel gym, 2 outdoor infinity pools. Very nice standard. Great for couples and honeymoons and business. We stayed in the best suite which had a massage room inside the suite, walking waredrobe, proper living room. You can have inroom service- but this was quite expensive. Would stay here again and would highly recommend. ",5,0.9952

"Absolutely discussed with this hotel. after booking using the reward system points for a week stay, one week before travel we received an email saying they were canceling due to a delegation arriving. I am pretty sure a delegation does not book a hotel with less than a week to go, I had to email and then phone them to find out what they were doing about this as I have flight's already booked. They could not find an alternative hotel, which i informed them on the phone they would have trouble as this hotel was my last resort at booking as all the other choices was full. Why, perhaps because they were more organised and knew a massive delegation were in town and were fully booked. there solution was to offer me a connecting room (2 rooms as apposed to one i had booked with my",1,0.8428
"Frankly saying was astonished by St. Regis, especially when was upgraded to Suite. It takes my breath - if you have a chance - try it , and you will never forget. Exceptional butler services - everything is done enough fast with excellent quality. Amazing Astor bar on evening helped me to spend a quality time, trying non-standard cocktails, while tasting cigar,  Unfortunately it was just 1 night, but I will be back! very good and convenient for business - as on arrival or departing, as it is located near Airport express and near by shopping mall. And do not worry about MRT and Express station - location is as secluded as you will wish. Excellent city view from pool area, I happily spend few hours, sipping cocktails. As well highly recommend - Taka by Sushi Saito and Ushi!!! bit",5,0.9883
"I visited Kuala Lumpur around the Christmas holiday season. Prior to arriving, Kit had helped us with details on getting to the hotel from the airport. We ended up taking a taxi and once we entered, we were blown away by the decorations in the lobby and the impeccable service upon check in. We had arrived close to midnight and were exhausted from the travel, and were delighted to receive an upgrade to a suite. Our jaws dropped as we were shown to our suite - the furnishings, the special balloons, and all the little details in the room. This has by far been the most luxurious room I have stayed at. Our butler was very hospitable and helped with our requests immediately. We had dinner from their late night menu, which we ordered a burger and a fried rice dish. Both were delicious!",5,0.8832
"While on a weekend visit to KL, I popped over to see the Astor Bar, which unfortunately does not open for lunch; so instead,  I went to the rooftop, pool-side, Crystal Bar. It is a great setting, high above the hustle and bustle of the city. While I was there, it was quiet, with only a few people using the pool, this suited me; though I understand it is very popular in the evening, probably because it is so ""instagramable"".   I had a tasty bar lunch and the service from Melissa and Lyn was friendly and efficient. Definitely worth a visit.",5,0.9371
"Had a short vacation for our anniversary. Really impressed with the exceptional service, especially our butler and the F&amp;B staff. Breakfast was excellent throughout and I'd recommend going on a food adventure in the city because there's so much more Malaysia has to offer. The bar was really nice, great vibe and very knowledgable barmen.  My wife and I had a scrumptious English-style tea at the drawing room. Dessert haven if you have sweet tooth like me. We stumbled upon the St Regis boutique at the back of the main hall past the lift lobby. It was easy to miss. Was so surprised to find that they sell Hermes Birkin bags, even the ones that are really hard to find at Hermes stores. Lucky for my wife, she got two anniversary gifts this year. My wife also loved the spa. We didn't",5,0.9887
