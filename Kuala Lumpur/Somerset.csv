"Ideal location on Jalan Ampang, nice breakfast and a great one and two-bedroom apartments with all amenities including washing machine, microwave and other basic appliances.  A rooftop pool, gym and a lounge of the top floor offers a comfortable environment and great views.",5,0.9612
"We stayed here as a family for four nights as part of our trip to Kuala Lumpur. The hotel was well appointed. We stayed in an apartment styled room, which had two separate bedrooms a living area, two bathrooms and a kitchen. This included a washer, microwave and a large fridge. The pool on the top floor was very pleasant and never very busy. It had wonderful views which looked fantastic at night. Late night swims is a must. The pool closed at 11 pm  Breakfast was served next door to the hotel, but  this was easily to get to. On the whole it was basic and a fairly interesting experience. Nonetheless not a problem, fresh omelettes were made on request and they were very nice. Breakfast was not the hotels strongest point.  The situation of the hotel was satisfactory it was a short",5,0.96
"It was an amazing stay we had. Maybe because of the COVID-19 and being low season, we were given an upgrade on the room when we checked-in. Room was comfortable and clean and spacious. Would definitely come back. ",5,0.886
"Overall is ok, also very convenient that Soul Out is just few step of walk. But parking fees for hotel guess RM10 per entry was too pricey, compare to before parking was complimentary, RM10 per entry is too over. Some hotel that use parking own by shopping mall, only need to pay for parking is just RM5 per entry. ",3,0.5719
"Excellent Hotel. Loved the facilities. Loved the pool, gym and resident's lounge. Loved that we can use the pool until 11.00pm. My only complaint is your front desk personnel by the name of Siti. She needs to be more friendlier to guests . A smile doesn't hurt. Train your staff to be more welcoming.. If she can't do that,put her as a backroom staff instead of at the counter. I'm staying at the hotel again soon. i do hope i don't see her at the reception counter anymore. ",4,0.9768
"Highly recommended, make use Of the ASR discount to get competitive room rates. Staff are generally helpful. Free shuttle to Twin Towers, China Town and Sentral Station. Roof top pool and gym is a great plus. Linc supermarket and eatery is 2 mins walk. ",4,0.9299
"city center . near to KLCC , near to pavilion .  easy parking but need to add rm10 per overnight . there is bar located att G floor. however  , i am litte bit dissapointed regarding the parking space, need to add rm10 per overnight to the receiptionist upon check out . hotel should prvide free parking for the guest  ",4,0.7506
"I always like this hotel but it was  a little bit disappointed when the hotel recently implemented car park charges to the hotel guest. other than that, it was all okay. Food was average. Room very spacious. The toilet was the best of all.",4,0.545
"I came here for Thai visa application. The residence is stone throw from the Thai embassy. It is close to the Linc, a chill complex with good coffee and plenty of restaurants. Convenient distance to the city center. Spacious room. Adequate gym room. ",5,0.5859
"Great rooms, all fine, but noise from 2 construction sites next to hotel can be disturbing during daytime, especially when visiting the rooftop pool. Without that the hotel would get a perfect 10. Pool is huge but sunbeds can become rare at times",4,0.7579
"The Best feature of this Apart Hotel is surely the Rooftop. Situated on the 22nd Floor, one can have a great view if the city while relaxing by the pool. The rooms are okay but could be more aerated. The restaurant SouledOut is a must try",4,0.8248
"Large, modern apartment with great shower and good large bed. Friendly staff who brought us extra toiletries as needed and room service (although the food wasn’t great quality). Great views over KL at night and would be happy to stay there again, though it lacks the character of some boutique spaces. ",4,0.9723
"The room&amp;view, perfect! Rooftop pool super cool view. Check in/out smooth-well trained staff. Parking very convenient with RM10-per entry for in house guest. Grab Pick/Drop off was easy too-great location. Close to KLCC&amp;TREC.",5,0.92
Loved the hospitality (front counter) and the room (got a free upgrade).  Strategically placed and most importantly it has value for money! Recommended for sure. Easy to book a Grab as well which makes travelling a convenient matter. Would suggest one thing which is to improve the breakfast buffet options.,5,0.9705
"Great hotel in an excellent location right in the centre of Kuala Lumpur. .apartments very modern, spacious and clean with an excellent roof top infinity pool and beautiful vie w!would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,0.9761
Very fast check in and were also upgraded. Nice clean and very spacious apartment. Roof top swimming pool . Would come back as very convenient to the centre. 12 min walk to the Petrona twin towers and the malls .,5,0.743
"The hotel is clean and well presented. Modern and stylish. Rooftop pool offers views of the city, the gym is well equipt, the guest lounge is comfortable. The breakfast had an excellent variety of options. Room was spacious and light with big windows and the view from the bathtub kept me in the bath until my toes went wrinkly!",5,0.9215
"We were so impressed with the staff and housekeeping here at Somerset.  There is absolutely nothing to fault here -  The apartment was HUGE and perfect for relaxing.  We stayed for 18 nights - used the hotel bus drop off service, caught the trains all over KL and also had the luxury of shops, restaurants and grocery stores close by.  The arrangement with Souled Out restaurant next door is very smart because the staff are lovely and the venue provides lovely food. We were also blessed to see both the apartment and Souled Out Dragon dance ceremonies which are now very special memories.",5,0.9859
I always suspect ratings and stars awarded to Malaysian properties are manipulated. This property look good upon entry to lobby but upon entry to room there was a real daggy smell. One would have thought that the property maintenance people would have made sure that the place was freshened up as guests were expected. There were no warm flowers as in the photos. The pool area although had good views but it needed a better cleaning all around the area and made cozier. ,2,0.8922
"The attitude of their General Manager Ms. Celia Kam was simply the worst we had seen in the hotel industry so far!     We were told that their car parking policy has been changed after we checked in.  A fee of RM10 per each exit will be charged, which was not stated while we did the booking.  Despite of that, we stayed 3 nights and even returned to stay for another 4-night after an excursion.  During our stay, we talked to their front desk and the Operation Manager about the ""unreasonable-priced"" car parking policy and we just realized many other hotel customers had the same opinions but nothing has been improved.  We then demanded to talk to the GM and tried to suggest a waiver scheme for the Ascott members or long stay customers.  Ms. Celia Kam returned our call in an arrogant",2,-0.922
"Booked 2 bedroom premium apartment for 3D2N and it is very spacious, which makes it comfortable for my kids to roam around the apartment. It is our repeated Somerset apartment booking within Malaysia as their maintenance is up to date so far and the cleanliness is up to our standard. The reception served as well with warm smile. It would be good if parking to be free for hotel guests, otherwise it would be charge at RM10/entry or hourly basis (whichever cheaper if you check via autopay machine). There was a slight cock up with our luggages where communication from the reception to the concierge was not well known (i guess). Waited for quite some time and we ended up went back to lobby as they were unable to confirm our luggage via the phone. Despite 2 bedrooms, the common",4,0.9393
"I guess I had the biggest ""hotel room"" ever for that rate. The apartment could hardly be used as I was on a work trip to KL. The service at the reception is perfect just the breakfast, next door served, could be improved.",5,0.7783
It was a pleasant stay. Love the space and amenities found in the one-bedroom apartment. The bed and mattress was superbly comfortable with two extra pillows. Bed sheets were clean. Thank you for the upgrade too.,5,0.9432
"I request for Studio, but they upgrade me to One-Bedroom Deluxe. Thank you very much. Excellent. Next time when I stay, hopefully they can give the same.  I enjoy very much during my stay and will recommend to others.",5,0.9675
The apartment was spacious for a family. Nice interior design w modern touch! Surely will be back here again. No doubt! There is a shuttle for free to the nearest tourist spot around the hotel which makes life easy.,5,0.8309
"the hotel s in a very nice area, closed to the center o Kuala Lumpur. The rooms are very clean and nice. The staff was very kind and hospitality .The price it was very good, compared with the hotel facilities.",5,0.9439
"My stay was great. Everything is well prepared but there’s a thing la, bathrobe got one only but the room is for two. But overall, the room has a nice view, very cozy, very ergonomics and most of all, comfortable af",5,0.9201
"We loved the hotel, very clean, beautiful and the staff very helpful and kind. Shame about the pool, had only 6 chairs so the likelihood of getting one was slim. Could of done with a bar at the top, even if it just sold soft drinks. But, worth staying as it was so close to the centre etc. ",4,0.9547
Staff are nice and courteous. Is convenience with the shuttle bus service which bring us to where actually we planned to tour. The rooms are clean but only disappointed with the cooking utensils. Overall quite satisfy with the stay. ,3,0.6357
"Very pleasant stay. Facilities and amenities are well maintained. Room was clean, equipped with washing machine. The shuttle was incredibly convenient and the location is quite close to KLCC and is easily accessible.",5,0.8687
"Superb room of big 1 bedroom deluxe with full house amenities like cooking utensils, full sized fridge, microwave. Also a bathtub with city view window is special. Another plus point is the infinity pool at rooftop with a beautiful sunset view upon KLCC. The parking lots have direct access to rooms which eases luggage transfer once checked in and complementary for hotel guests as well.",4,0.9485
This visit have completed my stay of Somerset hotels across Malaysia. Like always in all Somerset hotels are the hospitality of the staff from the cleaner to front desk and doormen always treats with smile and warmth gesture. This Somerset in particular have a bathtub for 1 bedroom deluxe executive which we have stayed. Big washroom and big rooms with location nearby KLCC and 10 minutes to my current house. Spectacular night view over sunset at large pool and clubhouse floor level 22. Definitely to consider if appreciate view and big hotel rooms complete with washer/dryer.,4,0.9201
"The residence had all that we needed for four nights in KL, especially the washer/dryer was a great thing to have after a little over a week in Malaysia. Also liked the view from the bathroom. The location is good, although it takes a little walk to get to any shopping or restaurants. The swimming pool itself was good but the small number of lounge chairs by the pool was a big disappointment: there were only five of them and they were all partly in the shade all day long. Sometimes had to wait a long time to get one. The breakfast was also quite lame.",4,-0.4194
"We booked suite room and was upgraded to 1 bed room on the top floor. The room is huge for two of us of course. Furthermore the apartment hotel has wash and dryer which i love so much, kitchen and dining/living area.  To be honest, only two downside the fixtures look a little old and the location. However it’s still walking distance to Ampang Park station.  The breakfast is at a restaurant in the same building. It’s worth the price you paid. Not huge spread but suit the price.",4,0.7506
"This property is located centrally, only 12-15 min walk from Petrona Towers. The rooms are spacious, fairly clean and with nice view. There was overwhelming cigarette smell on our floor despite the property being smoke free. We felt the smell initially even in our rooms but it went away after one day as we used AC. There is a good restaurant next to the property. If you don't need luxury and have a big family this could be a place for you.",3,0.8294
"The stay was good, the room was nice with comfortable beds and furniture. However, Check in was very slow, and when we arrived we were told that due to some piping problem, our room was not available. With the hotel being full, we were offered to be transferred to a different hotel, which I could not accept as I choose this hotel for some very precise reason (the rooftop pool facing KLCC and the distance to my dinner reservations for New Year Eve. The hotel did finally manage to find a room for us, and we finally managed to get into our room an hour after arriving.  Everything seems disorganized, which should not occur at a 4 Star Hotel, though I do appreciate the staff help in making sure I got everything, its just that being a 4 star hotel, I should not have to keep asking and",3,0.863

"Easily the best place that we have ever stayed in Kuala Lumpur. We took a 1 bedroom apartment for three nights and then I extended my stay for another night. The apartment was clean and spacious and very comfortable. It met, and exceeded our expectations. The staff were great - always helpful and accommodating. It is also in a very central location only a short walk from the LRT station, so easy to get around. We enjoyed our stay and will definitely return.",5,0.9827

"Excellent service and friendly staff, with a hotel in a great location close to the twin tower and the golden triangle area - I would recommend to family and friends. I have stayed at the Somerset on several occasions and its always been great.",5,0.967
"Residence is located a brief walk from the Ampang Park subway station, which really opened the city up, and being one stop from the KLCC complex meant you were close to shops, food court and supermarket. The apartment itself was spacious and good value. Minor criticism of the bed pillows. Way too soft if you like support. Bring your own or use one of the firmer lounge cushions.",5,0.6597
The place Is quite Amazing. Easy Access to go Anywhere such as KLCC &amp; Pavilion Bukit Bintang. Would love to recommended to stay for a few days.. The staff n cleaness of The room was Amazing.. they have a Great swimming pool as well ,4,0.9611

He was very polite , friendly , efficient and giving a service from the heart also a compliment to the bellman who are always friendly and always assist me to press the button to open the main door at your lobby. Was given room on 1702 which i like the view and of course the bed very comfy. Pool is a plus point on the roof top level 22 with magnificent view.

The views from the room was breathtaking and the location is really convenient far from the busy and crowded streets of the center but yet still close to a lot sights of the city. Everything was just great. The pool is also amazing. Petronas towers is only 20 minutes away by walking and not even 10 minutes with grab. Around the building 2-3 minutes walk) are shops, restaurants and also a mall where you can find all your necessities. Check in was really easy and staff was really friendly and helpful. The room had everything you could possibly need. I would absolutely recommend Somerset to anyone visiting KL. We had a nice stay.",5,0.9897

"Was upgraded to a one-bedroom apartment. Impressed with the cleanliness and the ambiance of the room the moment I step in. Ideal for business traveler who has meeting at KLCC and the surrounding area (and also for small group of 3) who stay longer than 3 days. All room types are equipped with kitchenette, washing machine n dryer.   Except for the TV channels - some are not working maybe due to network issue when i was there and the TV Set (in the master bedroom) has bad visual at some point",5,0.4588

The first day check-in with the issue of bathroom basin blocked. calling twice but nobody coming. I could only fix it by myself. Open the pain &amp; clear the dirties rubbish.

Too bad we forgot our swimming suit to try the pool out. It was a nice infinity pool too. You can see klcc from the pool.  The bathtub with view is the highlight of the stay.

"Not coming back again, absolutely it’s not value for money, breakfast is really bad , cleanliness of the rooms and hotel management trying to do cost cutting in their expenses so this is the result I can name it as 1 star maybe",1,-0.7645
The residence is just outside of the main KLCC area and a car drive away from Bukit Bintang. Not a deal breaker but if you are looking for utmost accessibility you'll have to go somewhere else.  The residence itself is in above average upkeep and their staff is really good. In all likelihood you'll come away with little to complain about and should look forward to your next stay there. I know I am.,4,0.3521
"After two weeks in the jungle, walking into the posh lobby and being greeted by the attentive, professional hotel staff was a welcome luxury.  Smoothly efficient and accommodating, they ushered up to our 11th floor room with a view of the developing skyline.  With spacious front room and adjoining bedroom it felt comforting and luxurious.  The hotel has meals arranged with the restaurant next door for buffet breakfasts.  For KL, it was pretty conveniently located.  A thriving shopping mall with a wide  array of cafes, grocery store, clothing shops and general merchandise was a short walk distance.  Only there two nights, the hotel arranged for our taxis flight connections as well.",5,0.9325

They charge you for bottled water, i was like wth RM1 for 1 bottle of water? I been all over the world, Morocco, France, Japan, China, Korea, Canada, UK, not one single hotel or serviced apartment told me they were charging. Its not like I cannot afford, but I think for the rate I am paying and having the right of thumb for a full service service apartment, bottled water should not be chargeable. I don't remember paying for it in Citadines (Bangkok, China) either. So that is a boon for sure  2.) Power Trip. Very strange apartment, the power tripped suddenly with no heavy usage, but the lights and aircon was there. Turns to phone and",4,0.2318

Nothing great, nothing horrible.  It's location is ideal next to the train station, and within a comfortable 20 minute walk, one can find a money exchange, grocery store, and the Petronas Towers.  The service was amenable; our requests for extra towels and blankets were met quickly and efficiently.  Our room was also cleaned promptly each morning.

"Dated but well maintained property with one of the most attentive front desk staff I've experienced.  The apartments are spacious and well-designed, albeit a bit old, but in a very good condition. The only downsides I can think of are: the study room is more of a closet than an office (no windows, bare minimum of furniture) and TVs are rather old with grainy aerial connection and no smart features.  Haven't had time to use gym and resident's lounge but both looked rather nicely equipped with plenty of snacks available at the lounge.  There's no convenience store nearby, but property provides a comfortable shuttle (mini-van) going on schedule, every hour, to KLCC with a pickup option.  Overall, recommended.  There is a construction going across the main road, but our apartment",4,0.9468

Somerset furnished apartments is a well standard place for any business or personal stay. I really felt at home in the apartment. Its nice place for family stay. My next trip to KL will be in this place only. I recommend it to all.,5,0.7506
The location is quite central and the rooms are great the price isn’t too bad but the lack of dining facilities lets it down. The Somerset’s reliance and relationship with Souled Out the venue next door does the Somerset no favours . The service is inconsistent as is the food and availability of items on the menu. If the Somerset controller it’s own epicurean destiny this could be the best place to stay in KL.,3,0.7227
"Wow what a gorgeous place to stay, I stayed for 3 nights and loved it. It was fab having a washing machine, after 3 weeks of travelling it was a bonus. Loved the pool up top. Also very good of them to lay on a free shuttle bus to various city landmarks. Would highly recommend and would defo stay here again.",5,0.9863
We are quite surprised with the room we received. The room is bigger and nicer than we expected. The tub has a nice city view. The parking is at the basement RM5 per entry during weekend but will be waived upon checkout. The restaurant nearby is Souled Out by Ampang. You may request for food delivery service with additional charge. Overall very pleasant stay. ,5,0.8532
Staff here were so friendly. This was our 2nd stay in 8 yrs. There was a promotion for stays if you are a Ascott member. Registration was free.  We were upgraded to executive room upon check in at 10 am.  Mobile charging stations were available in the lobby.  Washer cum dryer was useful for our stay. We used grab here which is a cheaper option than taxi.  Late check out was provided till 2 pm for our flight at 7 pm.  Hotel provided foc wifi which is a plus.  Will be back again.  ,5,0.8864

It also have a wardrobe separate room, living room, and kitchen. It also gives you a large refrigerator and microwave and washing machine! ",4,0.8676
"always my choice whenever im in kl. great hospitality, great staff and great ambiance. room is clean the bed and pillows are comfy. not so much on the bfast but it still good and cheap. best experience so far.",5,0.9593
"All the amenities was complete like staying in a house. The room was superb comfortable and luxurious at the same time. The location is very near to city center and shopping malls and the hotel also provide free shuttle to many locations and pick ups as well. The breakfast are limited choices but still good enough to have varieties and taste authentic local dishes. As a local, I approve. Pro tip, register and subscribe to the ENTERTAINER pass and you can get a complimentary night stay when you book one night with Somerset. ",5,0.9633
"The room was very clean, the mapping of Kitchen, Living Room, Working Desk, Wardrobe and main room are smart simple and convenient.  The thing that needs to be improved was TV Channel. Should add more TV Channel to be like a real home.",5,0.8832
"Loved the pool, location, room and everything about the hotel. Breakfast could have been better, but its fine if you are staying for 3-4 days. Will highly recommend this place to everyone. Managed to get an early checkin very easily. ",5,0.9158
This place is great for a quite family vacation. Very clean and nice. Food is a bit challenge but it has a kitchen apart from a laundry machine. Staffs are friendly and helpful. Easy access to car park.,4,0.9557
"My wife, 21 month old daughter &amp; I spent 9 nights here &amp; loved our room with a great view to the south of Kl. The staff were friendly &amp; helpful at all times &amp; there were no issues with our room at all. The staff fell in love with our daughter &amp; her curly hair!   There are three lifts, of which one at random would often be out of service due to the hotel going thru a maintenance cycle..not really an issue but hopefully everything will run smoothly once maintenance is complete.  The roof has a gym, lounge and pools with a fantastic view of the city..on the subject of the pools, both the main &amp; toddlers pools had what appeared to be small particles of black mould floating throughout them..enough of a quantity that they become hard to miss once they’ve been noticed.  The nearby bar",5,0.9455
"Somerset is a nice apartment worth staying, with a rooftop swimming pool, nice staff and cozy room which I think located in a pretty quite area with walking distance to Ampang Park Train Station. Hotel also provides shuttle bus service to KLCC, Times Square and few places in KL. ",4,0.8658

"Overall is good and room is so nice also the interior. The room also very clean. The problem is just no in-house restaurant. The location wise is good near with city centre and KLCC. However, have a nice bar&amp;restaurant next to it for drink and dine.",4,0.932
We personally enjoyed our 2 nights stayed here very much . Love the beautiful breathtaking views from our room. The room was clean and very cozy. It made me felt like home. With awesome roof top swimming pool. We enjoyed the night view with fireworks during the Chinese New Year period. The location of the hotel is very convenient and easy access to public transportation. However it’s in the center of the city. We took only 15 mins walk to KLCC. We  in love with the-green city too. ,4,0.9886
"Good hotel with great location easy access close to train station, big rom, clean, comfy bed, nice staff also many choice of breakfast and value of money  full of modern home appliances hot water for bath always ready for 24 hours  ",5,0.9601
"Stayed here early February 2019 for 4 nights. I booked one of the deluxe rooms and it was great, more like an apartment. Huge bathroom with fab walk in shower and a bathtub too. Big lounge with dining table, settee etc and a nice kitchen with fridge/freezer and a washer/dryer. The washer/dryer was a godsend as KL is very humid and was great to be able to wash and dry my clothes. The bedroom was massive with king size bed and a walk in wardrobe/dressing area. Bathrobes &amp; slippers supplied and an ironing board and steam iron plus a safe. Would definitely reccomend this property, only drawback is it is a little ways from KL city centre. The restuarant/bar next door was good but check your bill as a couple of times I was overcharged. As a hotel guest you get a 10% discount.",5,0.9403

"Wife was looking forward to a good soak in the bathtub, but once she saw the black mold, she didn't want to use the bathtub. I knew I could change the room but I could easily change rooms but I didn't bother. ",3,0.7408
We spent 6 weeks here on arrival in KL for a three year assignment here. We had a 2 bedroom apartment that was reasonably sized and comfortable. The maids were great and when we wanted it breakfast was ok. Nice bar downstairs too (Souled Out) which we still visit living nearby.,4,0.9081
"Very clean room, good accomodation and nice pool. It would be better if they have a room service for breakfast. It was a really nice place to stay and the amenities were complete and great. I would definitely recommend this and I will definitely go back here in the future ",5,0.9768
"Stayed in 2-br with my husband and 3kids which is spacious enough for us. Decided to stay here as me and my husband will go for medical check-up in HSC. It was convenient for us to leave the kids in the room as it’s very close and can go back to check on them when time allows. Everything we need are already in the room - separate living room, kitchen with microwave oven, washing machine with free detergent, dishwashing liquid was also provided.  They provide scheduled complimentary shuttle service to KLCC and Pavilion. But, unable to ride it as it was already full when i tried to booked the 4pm ride. Unfortunately, we can only stay overnight. But, would love to stay here again.",4,0.8316
Comfortable. Stayed for business for two months. Everything is very good. Just the breakfast were lack of variety. Parking for long stay is not complimentary. The swimming pool at rooftop is stunning and the gym as well. I would definitely choose this place if i come to KL either for business or leisure.                                  ,5,0.8476
"I travelled with 2 months baby.. And she is soooo comfortable with bed, entire room and toilet. I love  the toiletries and bath tub is clean.. I love the kitchen too and there was a washing machine microwave big fridge knife fork spoon plate a complete kitchen set which I did use anyway.. But I might consider for my next family trip which a lot of easier when u have a small kid",5,0.9382
"This was our 3d time in the hotel. Nice to be back and good to see that furniture etc were still in good condition. The hotel is comfortable situated, near 2 new shopping centers with foodcourts and the metro to take you further to KUL. ",4,0.8979
"Somerset Ampang is a top-notch facility for pleasure and business travellers. I enjoyed to comfortable building and friendly staff. The breakfasts were memorable and great.  The location is 5mins from LRT station; however, the sidewalk is uneven and difficult for wheeled luggage.",5,0.9442
"The location is good, the apartment is clean with kitchen and fast internet.  The only down thing for us is the breakfast, less selection some food are way too salty. The pool is nice, good set up and perfect view but unfortunately there are some korean events going on the time we were staying so the place is too occupied of kids and families. ",3,0.5994
