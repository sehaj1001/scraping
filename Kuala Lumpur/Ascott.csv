Stayed four nights on a family holiday with three generations. Clean and spacious and comfortable. A little disappointing that the breakfast is now in the ugly bar downstairs rather than on the rooftop like it used to be.,4,0.6115
"Great room and excellent service, staff geniality and polite. Good choice for my next trip in Malaysia. Location is good, very convenient to other scenic spots. only 5 mintues can walk to Petronas Twin Towers.

"well, first of all I do not know what this hotel is not ranked as a 5* hotel it has everything you need. I must admit that my reservation was 3 months in advance, in not so touristic period of the year, but any case, was so affordable, that I was confused what I paid and what I received (I hope that this comment will not force management to increase prices :) ). I really do not have any negative comment in sense price/given/taken ratio. wish you all the best, and see you soon",5,0.9754
"Didnt know where to go for CNY holidays, thought of Ascott KLCC as ive stayed with family before. Invited girlfriends from Johore to come over. Had such a great time from morning till night. In the morning we walked around KLCC park, breakfast at Tujo was great as always.  Housekeeping excellent....requested for extra bathing amenities...was given a bunch of them. Gfs were happy they could take home as gifts. Evening went swimming &amp; night continued shopping at KLCC. Next day walked to Pavilion which only took us 10 minutes. Overall stay was excellent as always.",5,0.9595
nice location needs to improve more and more because it seems to be old otherwise it is  a great location at reasonable prices short walk to kl twin and pavilion  and almost no trafficks to international airport,5,0.8357
"If you desire a home away from home with lots of space, great amenities, wonderful staff and of course a location within walking distance of everything the wonderfully vibrant city of KL has to offer, then look no further than the Ascott Kuala Lumpur. This is my second stay here and I highly recommend it for anyone from singles to couples and families. The Ascott has everything you could possibly want in accommodation from spacious and well appointed apartments, an onsite spa and business facilities, to caring, happy and informed staff. The location is superb being within walking distance of major retail, entertainment and dining attractions but is not as busy as the main Bukit Bintang hotel and shopping area. I will definitely be staying here again as this is my new home away",5,0.9711
"cosy feeling, friendly to family as well as business traveller.  Ideal location around KLCC area.  walking distance to Pavilion and KLCC.  Easy getaway to Bukit Bintang and PUDU area.  Big family room and relax pool site at 22fl ",4,0.9325

"The best apartment I have ever visited. The staffs made us feel welcome and security is tight, I feel safe. Ascott staffs are their most valuable assets, who offers excellent hospitality.   I would like to express my outwards appreciation and gratitude to the Ascott Kuala Lumpur Jln Pinang Team during my stay from 15-17Dec 2019 especially to Mr Faiz, Mr Kamarul and to the person who found my bangle Ms Norfa.   I left my bangle at the apartment and forgotten about it and only realised it when I boarded the plane to Singapore @520pm.   I was frantic thinking that I would never ever see my bangle ever again. When the pilot announced that there will be a flight delay, I quickly took my iPhone and emailed to Ascott KL to inform them I had left my bangle in the safe in the apartment. ",5,0.9787
"Service at the Ascott lived up to expectations. The 1-bedroom was large and spacious both for the living room and the bedroom. The pool, spa, and availability of room service was a nice touch. Breakfast items got a little boring after the second day but was functional for a business stay.  ",5,0.1018

A good place to relax..kids are easily excited just by having a bath tub in the room so my husband and I could have some rest before taking them to the pool. Room service menu from the restaurant was delicious too.,5,0.886

"Excellent view of KLCC park and beautiful and spacious apartment, however lightint was rather dim and airconditioning wasnt working well during my stay. Huge bathrooms with full facilities. Loved that the kitchen had all the utensils which allowed us to prepare food and drinks, especially having a nespresso machine was a plus!",5,0.9228
Staff handling the customers with smile and respect. Very professional. The security behaviour makes us feel comfortable and secured. Housekeeping done her job very politely and she not disturb any privacy's encounters.,5,0.9384

"I went to this hotel with my husband. The check-in was easy. The staffs were courteous and friendly. The room was nice, cozy and importantly, spacious! It was a studio apartment complete with a big fridge, kitchen, kitchen utensils, coffee maker, kettle, toaster, sofa set, king size bed, big screen TV, writing desk, bath tub, shower, Loccitane brand toiletries.   The location was superb! Just a walking distant to KLCC. ",5,0.9595

"Had a memorable stay in Ascott KL recently. Their service is awesome &amp; their cosy rooms lifted our spirit. Also, their great location is just a 5 mins walk to KLCC. If Spore Airlines signature motto is a great way to fly..then Ascott is a great place to stay! Well done Ascott!",5,0.9674

We have stayed here several times and I always get asked to complete surveys afterwards. So I happy to report that this was another good stay and I would recommend this place to anyone looking for larger rooms and a convenient location in the KLCC/ Bukit Bintang area.,4,0.8553
"I had a great 4 night stay in this hotel in a 1 bedroom suite on 32 floor. Great location to metro at KLLC accessed through mall next to petronas towers. Great bar in the basement, mixed crowd of work and leisure travellers. ",5,0.9231
"We come to stay at Ascott KL every time we come home to Malaysia. Location, cleanliness and comfort are the main pulling powers. Never overcrowded. Concierge is always lovely and helpful. Size of apartment is great. Our kids always love it here. Booking directly with them is cheaper that other booking sites like booking.com and Agoda.com",5,0.9633
"We had a very nice week stay here at the Ascott.  The customer service (from everyone - front desk, concierge and housekeeping) was friendly, helpful and speedy.   What we can't comment on, is the breakfast and Spa.  There are a lot of cafe options along the KL city walk, which is a 1/2 block away &amp; there are 2 Starbucks in walking distance as well.  The room was quite large, spacious and clean.  Housekeeping was great.  They even called on the day we requested no cleaning to double check if we needed anything.  The kitchen is a great plus, especially for those who would like to cook.  There is a great Cold Storage across the street in the Suria KLCC.  They also have prepared meals for take away, as well.  The pool and gym are good.  Both clean.  As most have mentioned, the",4,0.9851
Apartment was very clean. WiFi was excellent irregardless of where we are in the apartment. Staff was very friendly.  Good selection of food for breakfast but unfortunately the food ran out rather fast and it was slow to be replenished. Omelette was not replenished at all even though I had my breakfast an hour before breakfast ends.,5,0.5547
"I usually use hotel type rooms. However the Ascott provides a lounge,kitchen,double bedroom,change room and shower bath room. All clean and comfortable.  Check in was fine as I was the only one at reception.  Hotel is very well placed for the KLCC Petronas Twin towers.  Getting to the hotel was fine until we hit the city centre, so allow a little extra time.  ",5,0.9097
"Best location and great value to stay with family. We had 3 bedroom apartments, and the amenities are just great. If you looking to just walk to Suria KLCC with your family, I will definitely recommend to stay here.",5,0.9638
I stayed in Ascott Sentral near KL Sentral for 2 weeks. The suite was spacious and clean. Free breakfast was offered. Location was the best for me as it is near my workplace and KL Sentral which literally means I can easily take train to the central. There is a mall in KL Sentral with a lot of food and restaurants as well. Worth recommend to people on business trip.,5,0.9524
It was a pleasant stay and very comfy room.just 5 minutes walk to klcc.delish breakfast.convenient store is just out of the main door and have most everything basic you need.the room is very comfortable for my family and friends for visiting ,5,0.8748

"The staff were very friendly and helpful. The apartment was good if a little dated and it did not resemble the photos on the web page, but it was large and comfortable. The pool was amazing with wonderful views. Very easy walking to the conference centre and shops. The park opposite was an added bonus. The food in the restaurant was very good.",4,0.988
enjoyed the stay with family and size of flat was amazing we also liked the staff and Management we enjoyed the stay and recommended for any big family to stay- location is wonderful and restaurant is perfect ,5,0.9698
"The location is the best part of this hotel, right across the street from Petronas Towers, KLCC Park and a 5-10' walk from Suria and Pavilion malls.  Also the room was spacious and the beds were very comfortable. We appreciated the L'Ocitane toiletries that were filled up daily without extra cost. The pool was also clean and very nice for a refreshing dip. However, the room was not very clean, after a few days we discovered an Oreo biscuit and a slice of pizza behind the living room curtains, near the balcony door. Also the furniture (chairs in the dining room, the kitchen and bathroom furniture) were stained with some spilled liquids that could have been easily wiped (if thoroughly cleaned). Also there was a bad persistent smell as we entered the room. Fortunately the smell",3,0.9568
location of hotel is perfect. overall apartment condition and facilities are very nice. Hotel lobby was poor and does not give impression of a star rated services apartment. Breakfast was outside the building and very limited choice and poor selection of food items. ,4,-0.2269
"Arrived on 16.8.19 around midnight. Even you arrived midnight there's uncle to assist you. Check-in was smooth. Parking was quite easy.  We booked a 2bedroom deluxe. Room was big. Enough to fit 5-6 people with extra bed. Even the common toilet has a bathtub.  Near to KLCC, less than 5 mins walking.  Check out was smooth and fast even thou there are few others checking out at the same time, assisted by Mr Kamarul.  Will surely come back.  Thumbs out to Ascott Kuala Lumpur.",5,0.8221
Rooms are clean and spacious. Kitchenette utensils are provided. Toilets are old and some parts are rusty. Walking to KLCC abt 5mins but gotta cross the heavy traffic so gotta beware of snatch thieves. Overall a pleasant stay.,3,0.2144
A perfect place for family of 4 @ we booked a 2 bedroom premier apartment. Room was great and location of the hotel to several malls were also just walking distance. Staff were awesome always going an extra step to make your stay a comfortable and memorable one. ,5,0.9451
"Hi,  As mentioned above, the location of this hotel is really good as it is in the heart of KLCC. The rooms are ok, the only thing I did not get right with the facilities was the A/C because it was not calling enough. Keep in mind that this hotel has a laundry room at the rooftop so you can wash the clothes by yourself while enjoining the swimming pool, avoid paying expensive rates to the hotel for laundry service! By the way, the reception team did not talk about this at the time of the check in.   The people is very kind however, I need to say that the services were very lenghly. Whenever I called for housekeeping it took ages and even if I called twice! I hope the management improves this!  Bye...",3,0.9255

"Stayed a few days with the family in a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom apartment. Super central location between MO and Grand Hyatt. The apartment is well furnished with comfy beds and all the appliances you can think off. Bedrooms are large but the living/dining room is on the smaller side compared to the rest. However quite a few things contribute to not making this a 5* option : decoration is a bit too “American business hotel from the 20th century”, windows are not double glazed and given that the hotel is on a busy street there is a constant traffic noise (and you can't miss the call to prayer night and day), windows do not open on the (minuscule) balcony, our bathrooms generated a foul smell which graced the whole place, the road access to the lobby is narrow and cabs/grabs get",4,0.6808

"What would have been a nice stay in a nice service apartment marred by horrendous check-in experience. Not sure if the staff were incompetent or they need to spend a lot of time in front of the PC before allocating a room. Worse, because of the busyness, we only got our room at 5.45pm, almost 3 hours after official check in time.",2,-0.7478
"Front desk, room service all meeting expectation.  The only disappointment caused by the ONE &amp; ONLY restaurant attached. Truly disappointed. Stay for a week and ordered for room dine in on 1st evening. Food failed to deliver on time. Over 35mins delayed from the committed time with no follow up nor apology. 2 chasers sent with front desk intervened to resolved the issue. Food received with a very sour face..... How disappointed. We decided to order from outside where the front desk staff was always accommodative to arrange someone to help deliver to our door steps.   There's a night where next room played their TV in loud volume around 1am and woke me up. Although it wasn't pleasant and took almost 45mins to resolved the issue but I have to give this credit to the front desk on",4,0.0964
"This is probably my 10th time staying at the Ascott KL.  This most recent stay has been one of the best.  Efficient check in, rooms were great, front desk and porter service staff were all very friendly, efficient and helpful.  The location is excellent; just minutes walk away from KLCC and the Pavilion.  I will surely be back again.  Highly recommend it.",4,0.9832
"Although the room met our expectations and we had no complaints, we were however disappointed with the (lack of) speed during check in. We weren't sure what took so long but it took longer than other hotels. This was after we had provided our booking details, passports for verification and paid the room deposit. It would have been bearable had it not been for the very hot and humid environment in the lobby.   Check out was smooth. However since our flight was in the evening we had to leave our bags in the lobby and come back for it before leaving for the airport. We had wanted to freshen up before the long 1hour ride to the hotel but found that the lobby didn't have a bathroom/toilet facilities at all. They directed us to the general bathroom outside but we found that it was our",3,-0.4019
"Stayed 4 nights and rooms and facilities were fine. The check-in process is extremely long and painful. Allow at least 15 minutes- more if you have to wait for other guests. Surely a hotel chain of this size can get a better  software system that doesn't require a million mouse clicks and all guests details to be entered multiple times. Check-out wasn't any better. Another guest checking out at the same time thought it was a sick joke for a hidden candid camera show. On top of this we were billed twice for one night- ""staff error"" was the reason. We wouldn't stay here again unless they fix the reception wait time- better way to spend our holidays. ",1,0.8669
"Stayed for one night during the weekend, the checkin was pretty smooth thanks to anitha from front desk reservation. thanks for the hotel arrangment for our wedding aniversary celebration. the room is spacious and comes with well equiped kitchen. Great location and near KLCC suria shopping . The facilities floor at level 22 was great and very nice swimming pool. Unfortunately, the check out was slow and crowded due to short of staff. Overall was still a great memorable stay. ",4,0.9753
"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Ascott. The apartment was comfortable with a lived-in feel to it. We were happy to spend time our time in the apartment.   The location is terrific - close to the MRT station, a good array of eateries, and convenient shopping.   Breakfast is delicious. Indulge myself with the crispy ayam goreng on both days and it was impossible to stop after the first piece.  Wish we could have stayed longer. ",5,0.9674

"We stayed in a three bedroom serviced apartment. Functional full kitchen with full size fridge, large common lounge room with ample seating and dining area, each bedroom has an ensuite and television.  Housekeeping replace the toiletries and water bottles daily, vacuum and clean as required Fabulous location in the city centre and easy walking to all the major shopping malls.  Buffet breakfast in the house restraunt on the ground floor - Tujos. The food available could be a bit more diverse with more continental breakfast variety. Recommend going early to breakfast as the 9-10am time was always crowded with food replenishment and fresh plates struggling. The staff we found always very friendly and  welcoming.   Easy relaxing after a full day out at the swimming pool on the 22nd",5,0.9711
"At the center of everything only problem i have here is that housekeeping is not as consistent and ,flexible and clean compared to any other hotels I've been too. Also, slow internet connection.

"We arrived in KL quite late night and check in one hotel on line. When we entered the room , we were so disappointed because it was totally different from the name value of hotel.

 It is good to be  centrally located when leisure trips are not packed with schedules! Ascott KL provides that!! The location entailed that we could move around without a vehicle covering the shopping areas easily. A little traffic congestion is there while moving in and out of the property but a leisure trip it's okay! Good restaurants/food courts in the vicinity!!!,4,0.8755

The location of the apartment is awesome &amp; centralised. Few minutes walk to KLCC and Twin Tower. Reception staff and door man were helpful and friendly. Also the breakfast spread was generous and pampering.   However the quality of the room condition needs to be improved. The shower didn't work well at all in the twin bedded room I stayed in. The water was coming out from the tap and hand shower despite the fact that I was pulling the knob for only shower.   Reported the case the next day to Reception. But nothing was rectified when I was back in the evening thus I skipped the shower due to the frustration I had.   Also the bed sheet was stained. Carpet looks tired and unwelcoming. Room was 1401. ,3,0.9413

Pool area could be improved with the provision of a small drinks/food area currently you have to order from restaurant downstairs and wait for them to deliver. Proximity to the Twin Towers KLCC shopping and park are superb. Would I stay again if I was in central KL yes",4,0.8555
"What suprised me about Ascott was the sheer size of the apartment. It had 3 bedrooms with 3 bathrooms an immense living room and a state of the art kitchen with a Nespresso and a double fridge.Each bedroom has a large tv, gown and slippers, iron, umbrella and a hair dryer. The master bedroom has a safe - free to use.   The living/ dining room has a large  tv with sofas, desk and a dining table.

The breakfast was ok and enough.",4,0.1505
Great hotel with friendly staff and well-maintained facilities. Location is perfect for shopping in KLCC and twin towers. Buffet breakfast was OK since the whole dining area is a grilled bar by lunch and dinner. Eating porridge on a club chair is somehow awkward. It's a tiny issue and would love to recommend this hotel to somebody else. Overall it's an enjoyable stay.,5,0.9717
"When I first got into the room, I was impressed that the apartment is so spacious, with the price I get and the location within the KL gold triangle, it is really worth it.

Easy enough if you want to cook during your stay.  The living and dining room is large, with lcd tv at living room and also in the bedroom.  Have both bath tub and shower.  And what I love most they have separate walk in closet to store your clothes.

"There are indeed better, fresher looking serviced apartment around. Location is good but Ascott really need to look into maintaining the rooms.   Deluxe category rooms should really be taken out as the interior is really outdated and not worth to be categorized under the once prestige Ascott apartments. ",2,0.2266
The 3 bedroom apartment was great.  A good size for a family of 5 adults not to feel cramped and have plenty of room.  The location just a 5 minute walk from KLCC Park and Petronas Towers means that there are many food options nearby.  The only improvement I would suggest is to lighting - the 3rd bedroom was very dark even in the day time - we needed torches to look in our bags.  It also a mystery to me as to why such a large apartment has been built with no laundry room.,5,0.8316
"We stayed in a very large and fully furnished 2-bedroom apartment. We could store food in a large refrigerator, cook in the kitchen with spacious and convenience space. The room is quite clean (you should press the cleaning button in the morning when you go out, otherwise the staff will clean your room in the afternoon when you com back, thus it is a little inconvenient). Staff were very friendly and goodwill, they were willing to help everything you asked. It is not so far from the hotel to commercial centers or entertainment venues, just a few minutes by car.",5,0.9322
"I traveled here on business and booked two two-bedroom apartments. One was on the 31st floor and was SO BIG. The other was on the 23rd floor and was SO SO BIG! For the cost it was an extreme bargain.  The location was great for our purposes (conference) and also for walking around the wonky downtown area. The hotel across the way had a 57th floor bar that had amazing views of the twin towers and city.   Love the rooftop pool on the 22nd floor including the infinity pool at the end. That's right, they had two pools because why not?   The restaurant downstairs was good enough for dinner, pretty solid for our included breakfast.  Excellent stay all in all.",5,0.9766
"The apartment was huge, fully fitted with everything I could need, I couldn't believe the size of the room for the cost - it is a bargain. the location is ideal, cross the road to the patronas towers and a huge shopping mall. Straight outside the entrance there is a nice bar and restaurant and they will act as your room service and deliver to your room.",5,0.91
"Location is perfect, only 3 mins walk to Petronas and 7 mins walk to shopping malls. Our 02-bedroom apartment was so amazing with a huge living space and a cozy fully-furnished kitchenette whereas the light is little dark. Excellent service with staff members but we were slightly disappointed with poor breakfast. ",5,-0.0488
"The apartment was big and spacious. Brought my mom twice, once during Christmas stay and recently CNY. My mom loved it, my kids loved it even my niece and nephew love it. Will arrange to come and stay again. Walking distant to shopping area - KLCC.",5,0.9186
"Generally, comfortable and enjoyable stay. Location is very close to KLCC mall and Petronas Towers, like 10 min walk. The service from the team is actually very good and we were upgraded upon check in into 2bd suite which was enormous and very well presented. It has 2 bedrooms, 2 baths, living room. Really massive. The beds were really, really awesome. I had fantastic sleep for the 2 days. The only slight negative is breakfast. Its very, very limited and during our time on breakfast 2 times half of the plates were empty, which I didnt expect. In any case, very good opportunity in the center of KL. Will visit again.",4,0.9687
"I stayed at the hotel in January, 2019. The employees' service was great, and they were able to spend their family trip comfortably. Thank you so much for your thoughtful gift and room assignment for our family.",5,0.9313
we are a family of 5. the 2 bedroom apartment is very good and big enough for us. very close to klcc and we only ha to cross one small traffic signal to get there. with small kids the hotel was ideal. rooms are very good and quite new. kitchen is also well kept so we could boil milk for the kids in the room and also occasionally order in food. when we  travel with family to KL we will only stay at the ascott. hotel is definitely worth it if travelling with family.  ,5,0.9508
Room 2004 (24 Jan to 27 Jan 2019)  Great stay and value for money! The 2 bedroom suite is huge and nicely decorated. Great for family stay. The kitchen is fully equipped and clean. Ascott is located very near to the Twin Towers and 15 minutes stroll to the Pavillion. Dining is not an issue here too. The staffs are friendly and helpful.   Great place to stay when visiting KL.,5,0.982
"Stayed over the Christmas period with my dad and sister. The 2 bedroom premier apartment we booked was huge, clean, well equipped and really luxe.   The city skyline views of Kuala Lumpur were fantastic as we stayed on the 21st floor.   My only gripe with the room is that its rather dim as most of the lighting fixtures are soft ambient lighting with no spot lamps even at the writing desk. This makes it difficult to do any reading or work. ",4,0.7184
It was my business trip for 3 Days 2 Night. However there's no bedroom serviced apartment but only 1 complimentary parking which caused inconveniences. The breakfast was disappointed somehow. The staff was helpful on the other side. ,3,0.4215
"The hotel is a bit old, but still clean. The room is very spacious. The location is near KLCC but might be traffic all time. Breakfast not very good. Same price should be able to find better room nearby.  飯店有點老，但房間還算乾淨寬敞。早餐普普。地點離雙子星很近但可能也會很塞。相同價位可以找到更好的。",3,0.608
"We booked a 2 bedroom suite and it was fantastic! From check-in to room &amp; breakfast...it was all very good. The staff are very polite and always helpful and polite. The room is super spacious and well kept. It has all the amenities you need. Breakfast has a good variety, not fancy but enough to keep all happy. Very close to Twin Towers and shopping centre, literally just across the road. Easy walk to Pavilion Shopping mall too. Will definitely come back again.",5,0.9724
"Can't beat location, and superb quality accommodations at an acceptable price level. Skip breakfast on site which is way south of horrible and quite frankly overpriced garbage, and go outside to a Starbucks or CoffeeBean and Tleaf which are way better.",4,0.7003
"We recently stayed with Ascott KL after having the most amazing customer service experiences at other Ascott properties. Ascott KL has a fantastic location and the rooms are a great size (if needing a little bit of paint to spruce it up) however the service we received was below par and we were disappointed. There were numerous interactions with front desk, asking questions, leaving bags on check out etc and every single one was blunt and there was no welcoming feeling from the desk. Plus the in room iron stained a white shirt and not even and offer to clean the shirt when I contacted them and there was work taking place on the property which meant drilling from 9am",3,0.9273
Very big and spacious rooms. Very big and cozy beds. All the amenities are exceptional.Great location. Exceptional service by the staff. Definitely will recommend to our friends.Thank you so much Ascott!,5,0.6696
"We book a 2 room apartment. It was decently large. Amenities were nice. Service was good.  Faiz of front office did an excellent and swift check in.  All questions were answered well.  If I had to be picky, it would be the shower was not hot enough.  Side note, we booked via Agoda and were told it was cancelled last minute because of renovation.  We were furious but decided to call Ascott directly.  The our surprise, our reservation was valid. So Im not sure what sinister stuff was going on.  We will not use Agoda again.",5,0.809
"Stayed at the Ascott for 2 nights, took the 2 bedroom apartment. Strategic location, perfect view of the New Year fireworks @ KLCC. However, sad to say maintenance is   not up to the mark of a 5 star residence. The common toilet had residue of poop when we checked in. But we did not make it an issue because, we thought they might be busy due to new years and overlooked. However, we found the toilet flush not working. Had to flush 4 to 5 times after use. Next day we informed the housekeeping lady who came to clean the unit. She made a complain right in front of us and said someone will be coming. But no one came until we checked out the next day. Apparently the toilet had an issue even before we checked in but no one looked into it. Otherwise, it's a great place to stay with",4,0.5574
"Drive from International Airport to/from Ascott took 45 minutes to 1 hour, subject to traffic flow. Useful to have pre-arranged transport to/from Airport.Walking distance from Ascott to major shopping malls, but may not be suitable for very young children. However reception staff is helpful to call for taxi or arrange transportation as required.",4,0.6858
Nice place to relax and recuperate from all the busy schedule. The surrounding location was strategic (shopping and leisure). Comfortable and nice room suite for big and small group of familys. People friendly service (all with a smile) and helpful especially the staff. ,5,0.9501
"Highly recommended for those who travel with family and looking for accomodation that is nearby to KL City Centre. The staff is friendly, cleanliness is superb. The only thing is the area is known for its heavy traffic especially during working days. ",5,0.8553
"This is our favourite choice for our stay in KL. There are one, two and three bedroom fully serviced apartments, with attached bathrooms. There are free complimentary wifi in the whole location. Gym and Swimming pools are at level 22, and breakfast is now at ground floor. For those who drive, parking is complimentary. It is walking distance to KLCC and Pavilion shopping Malls. ",4,0.8442
"Easy access to KLCC and Pavilion. We love the cleanliness and neatness of the place. My children love the space that they have and the swimming pool was clean and not crowded. However, the breakfast spread was a bit limited and not much variety. But the food was fresh and tasty. We wished that we could stay there longer but we would definitely come back there again as a family.",5,0.9081
"I booked a deluxe 2 bedroom apartment on Bookings for our getaway, and chose it for its central location.  Truly enjoyed the minimalist yet well-equipped and super comfortable apartment. Lots of cooking equipment available, including dish rags and a chopping board. Pleasantly surprised to find that the 2 bathrooms both had bathtubs each. Only grouse is maybe the shower glass partitions which were a bit cloudy.  Breakfast was simple but satisfactory, continental with noodles and porridge.  The Ascott staff were all round friendly from the doorman to the reception and also quick to address our requests, making special preparation and a cake for one of our birthdays. Would recommend Ascott for family travels! ",4,0.9746
"Booked an apartment for New Year Eve family vacation 70 (!) days in advance. They emailed the confirmation number, charged my credit card, and, suddenly, 2 weeks before the stay, I received an email informing the booking is canceled due to renovation and maintenance.  Sounded very suspicious, how come the repair works came up so urgently (flood? hurricane?, earthquake?), and conveniently fell right on the most busy day of the year.   The email offered, in exchange of the canceled booking, an accommodation at another property. I rejected, firstly because I can book that property at the fraction of the price I paid for Ascott, and second because its location was lousy. I demanded full refund, but the respond was ""it's subject to management decision"". What?! They basically took my",1,-0.7744
"I had issue of revised date of stay when I checked in. But Anitha professionally handled the issue and can solve the problem. I ended up got a room somehow, thank you so much to Anitha and GS Manager who sort it out. Wahida from reservation also apologized for the misunderstanding. Aldila is very friendly and kindly show me the prayer room, not just giving me direction. That was very helpful! Also Faiz, he took picture of me and my family beautifully. My mother and aunties really love staying in AKL. Thank you so much for the warm welcome and giving us memorable stay in our first time visiting KL. And the breakfast is bomb! I love the food so much and the staff was very efficient. When they see clear plate, they initiatively clear it up! The view from swimming pool is amazing, I",5,0.989

No regrets even though quiet pricey.  The best luxury service apartment ever!!! ",5,0.9475

The two-bedroom apartments were very spacious, and the amenities were generous with nice L'Occitane toiletries which were great, fluffy towels and the kitchen stocked with coffee capsules for the Nespresso machine and great choices of tea bags.
