"I have been there during the lockdown for Covid 19, The hotel was nice, I have upgrade my room by pay 30 MYR and had a great view of jungle, The room and hotel was clean and the location is perfect nest to the KL Sentral station, Beacause of the Covid 19, the public places were closed and the breakfast was served in the room, at the checkout they tried to double charge me for the room service breakfast which was not right as I booked the room with breakfast and their restaurant was closed, After I told them they cancelled the cost from the bill but they still charge me for the in room service, I can say that the adding cost was not by mistake as I saw another person had same problem too.",2,0.6065
"Had a 24-hour long transit and the Hilton at KL seemed like the perfect place to spend the night. What impressed me the most was the great customer service given by Ryan. Not only did he give me a better room but he also streamlined the whole process, while elaborating on the benefits of staying in this establishment--from tea time to dinner and the spa services. Additionally, I would also like to recommend the lady from Bangladesh, Britti, whose service at the restaurant was great--I highly recommend her and I hope the hotel offers her a permanent job offering.",5,0.9771
"We were stuck between our 2 home countries recently, and decided to put up at The Hilton Sentral, Kuala Lumpur. The room - Executive Plus Suite - was excellent with spacious layout, great amenities, super-comfy bed. But what stood out most was the personal service and attention we received. From hotel manager, Gajan, to Chez Kazi (who oversaw our special dietary needs), to our Housekeeping staff, Sherajull (who left us little ""stay healthy"" notes) we felt safe, never stuck! To the Front Desk staff like Shahril,  Nani and John, ""Magic"" (the hotel's immediate royal service) assistants like Ismail and Nik, our heartfelt thanks for making us feel at home. If I had to point out a shortcoming, it wld be the fact that CNN is not offered on their TV channels. An easily overlooked fact.",5,0.9772
"Loved Hilton KL’s cosy lounge. It has always been our chillax place. Lovely food, great variety of drinks, comfy sofas and a lovely view. Friendly service. We like to come by every once in while to just relax here.",4,0.9756
"Stayed in this hotel for 4 days before going to Langkawi, hotel in perfect location. Staff excellent food very good value for money perfect.  . Staff in restaurant very friendly chef in graze restaurant came out talked about food and even prepared some oysters for me.  Sorry chef I did take your name to mention you but 4 weeks on I’ve mislaid.   ",4,0.8893
The location on top of airport train station is hard to beat when you are arriving at KLIA and can take the KLIA express. Take the train or tube to locations for business to avoid traffic jams... Fantastic breakfast spread. Spacious well maintained gym (shared with Meridien which is next door).  You can also walk out for many food options and also next to a large shopping mall.,4,0.5994
The hotel was very accessible within walking distance to KL Sentral. Rooms were appointed and beautiful. I stayed in a room on the 27th floor and had incredible views. Breakfast was delicious with nothing to complain about. Service staff were kind and attentive. Would recommend if you are staying in KL,5,0.9394
"The hotel was great, check-in all the way till checkout was smooth and all the staff were really polite. Had the opportunity to be served by a gentleman named Harvinderjit Singh who was very polite and very helpful. The room was spacious and very well styled. The executive lounge was also a great experience with it being a highlight of my trip! Will definitely go back when I have the chance",5,0.9715
"It is really a nice stay here in Hilton. We stay for 4 nights and it was a great stay. What impressed us the most is the service given by Ryan. He is really a great customer service. He explain every details about hotel facilities, dining offer and spa and he is very friendly. He is a great asset for Hilton. And also would like to thanks Rubiah of housekeeping staff. They all did a great job. Thank you and definitely will come back. Anita and Elaine ",5,0.99
Lobby Staff service was good. Deluxe Room’s ambience and spaciousness + cleanliness good but needs maintenance for the blinds. Cannot use it as it was faulty. Did not see a shaver kit for men in the room or did not notice. ,5,0
"Very yummy meals with family.. great chef Fai and chef Kenny .. continue to create new menu with no repeat .. however , the ventilation in the restaurant from the tempanyanki area was horrible.. I think the management really should find ways to improve ! I hope to be able to rate this favorite place with 5 stars in my next trip! ",4,0.9557
"Stayed in Hilton KL for a few times  already.  The room cleanliness, amenities, breakfast selection are all tip top standard.  The only thing i will comment on is the receptionist service as well as the crew in the lounge.  Looking forward for friendlier crews but overall is still fabulous stays.",5,0.8201
"Decided for a weekend staycation, and since I've never tried Hilton KL before, so figured I'm due for an experience there. Checked into what's called the 'Lifestyle Suite', and it is a beautiful suite. What I absolutely love is the abundance of storage spaces hidden all around the room. And the usage of mirror walls also contribute to make the suite appear much larger than it actually is. Overall, a fantastic room. But the best thing bout this place is of course its gorgeous swimming pool. Rarely you get a resort style pool in the middle of the city, so its quite surprising to see one like this here. Huge pool, with water slides and rock features, and a jacuzzi too! What's more it opens til 9pm, which is a very much of a rare commodity these days as hotel pools tend to close at",4,0.9817
"The brand - Hilton, says it all.  I know it is one of the luxurious hotel before i check in first time in history. Booked in for a night stay before departing to the airport for overseas trip. Was very tired after a long train trip.  Unexpectedly, check in was fast and join their membership too, all of these took me like 10-15 mins.  When in the room, it has a very strong attraction that keep you wanted just to stay in the room the whole day. It is very comfortable be it anywhere inside the room. The bed, pillow, couch overlooking the city. which we purposely went out to buy wine just to enjoy the moment. Night view is spectacular.  The room comes with a bathtub with separate shower, relax and cozy, LOL.  The next morning breakfast, it is like all major Malaysian food is there",5,0.9723
"We spent 3 nights here in December and had an excellent stay. The hotel and room has an updated modern and high-end feel. The service was excellent as well. When the morning buffet was full, and a line starting to form, the staff promptly diverted guests to a second restaurant with pretty much the same offerings. The location in Sentral was perfect, just a single train ride from the airport and a short taxi or transit to the main tourist spots and downtown.",5,0.9468

We spent 10 days in KL at the at the end of February and and an excellent stay! This is a large and very well staffed property adjacent to the Sentral Metro station which provides great access to KL's business and tourist attractions. We were pleased with all aspects of our visit especially with the Executive Lounge staff and offerings. Their breakfast selections and service were exceptional. Our host on most days in the lounge was Mr. Singh and he provided us with great hospitality and suggestions for a great experience. Our room had a great view of the lake an was very comfortable and inviting.  When next in KL we will be staying here.,5,0.9879
"I stayed in at the Hotel for one night in February 2020. This is our short break in the city to breakaway from the usual chores and work. I booked the executive room with the intention of being pampered by the hotel with the additional services offered. It didn’t turn out well for me.  Check in service was ok, staff were friendly. The room was not ready so we decided to wait at the executive lounge. First impression was off. The lounge was busy but staffs were much busier. After a while we were seated and attended. Fast forward, now to the room. Despite being large, it didn’t feel very welcoming. A typical city hotel feel. The bathroom facility is nice. A decent size bath tub and marble does make it look grand. No big fault with the room however lack of executive feel to it. We",3,0.7804
"We got to book the hotel just a few days ago. The hotel decor is beautiful ! Cool view of KL . The food is good although I must say they need to train the foreign workers to provide high quality service associated with reputable hotel such as Hilton. Apart from the door bell that is not functioning, we are impress with the hotel new concept &amp; design !!",4,0.9165
"I've been staying at the Hilton KL Sentral for quite a few years. I find great hospitality amongst the staff on all levels, rooms are very well maintained and comfortable. When you walk into the lobby, the bell hops welcome you with a smile and a greeting, even offering to take my bag for me even when I only have a handcarry wheelie. Smily and personable staff at the reception desk. Housekeeping are always smiling and saying hello when I walk by. Maybe I'm smiling all time too, haha, but I do feel comfortably at home here. The pool area is great for kids! My kids love the slide and when they were here, they spent almost the entire day at the pool. Food service is good although when I'm back in KL, I mostly eat local food outside the hotel. So my food review will be only of the",5,0.9875

"So i'll start with the positives: - the location is perfect if you have a short stay in KL and need access to the airport express train.  The hotel has a connected walkway to the KL Sentral Station where the train runs to and from. - the hotel itself is very nice.  The lobby is ambient, the pool area is vast and great and the gym is probably one of the best equipped of hotels in KL. - rooms are great.  Aircon worked fine.  Comfortable bed.  Multi plug points.  What let it down for me - the front desk service.  It just isn't good enough for a Hilton, especially a Hilton in asia.  I'll start with my check in.  The receptionist was not rude or unpleasant but I might as well have been using one of the self check in kiosks.  There was no welcome.  There was no use of name.  No",3,0.9336

That being said, the hotel responded quickly and my room attendant did a wonderful job for the 4 nights I was there...

"Overall 3nights stay was good.  Little hiccups upon check in. As i requested for room disinfection prior to my arrival however my request was being turned down. The operator told me that they can only prepare sanitiser in the room which im ok with the arrangement. Upon check in, the foa confirmed me that the sanitiser will be send over shortly to my room. After checking in the room, nobody sending anything over so i call to reconfirm however a lady who answered my call told me they cant provide such request and it was a miscommunication. After that i went out for a walk. When  i am back to my room after an hour plus, the sanitiser was in my room. I find it confusing and seems like the staffs are not communicating.  Room condition and cleanliness is good. Space is rather small",4,0.8225

"My family and friends frequents and dines in many fine establishments, and sometimes the only reason we keep going back is not necessarily on account of the brand, but because of staff like Azmi who is an asset to the hotel. Being in the service industry for almost 4 decades, it's only natural that I have an eye for detail and have raised many issues with Azmi, who has only turned situations around in the hotel's favour. Frankly speaking, we would have ceased patronising the Hilton quite a while back. Quite honestly, Azmi should be in PR ... I trust you would harness and take him the distance.

"I previously reviewed this hotel 3 years ago and gave a very positive review then.  I am very happy to say that I am doing the same this time.  The Hilton KL is one of the nicest Hilton properties we have stayed in, and we have stayed in many across their different brands as Diamond HH members.  The stand outs here are the staff and the general amenities.   The staff are superb from Diamond reception, to the concierge , pool attendants and as a special mention Mr Harvinderjit Singh and his staff in the Executive Lounge.  One of the nicest lounges we have had the pleasure of making use of. All in all a great hotel, ideally situated for enjoying KL.",5,0.9905
"My main concern when staying in any hotel is the attitude of the staff. And I can say totally that the staff here are genuinely the best I have met on my travels. They are professional in their approach, but also have a charm and willingness to help guests in every situation. They show interest in the guests, which is quite a rare thing.",5,0.9464

"I’ve had the pleasure of staying at the Hilton Kuala Lumpur numerous times over the past five years.    The hotel is well situated in the heart of the city with a large shopping mall next to the property, the famous Southfields district behind, and the Sentral train station / KLIA Ekpres across the street.   I recently had the pleasure of staying at this lovely property a few weeks ago.     What I love about this property is the impeccable attention to detail placed on every aspect of the guest experience.  Check In is flawlessly done either in the lobby or the Executive lounge.   From the moment you step into the lovely high ceilinged entrance, the hotel staff make you feel welcomed and comfortable.

Our room was prepared with romantic decorations and we were even left with a box of macaroons in the room which was delicious. The buffet breakfast spread offered a huge variety of different cuisines and was managed very well despite the usual chaos. We encountered some issues through our stay, but all our concerns were met and dealt with brilliantly. Worth the price, and would definitely come again.  ",5,0.968

"Hilton Kuala Lumpur has been my favourite place for dinner since Jamie’s lead. However, starting from October 2019 onwards, autopay machines (on lobby level) stop working EVERY TIME I am about to pay.  I always finish dinner around 10.30pm and that’s the time the 2 autopay machines show ‘OUT OF SERVICE’ on screen.  There’s one time intercom informed to pay at exit BEFORE I insert my parking ticket, as I was approaching the machines. I addressed this issue to Hilton hotel before but this incident happens repeatedly.  Today I went for dinner at Hilton again. Happened to see a staff switching the mode of the machines to make it “OUT OF SERVICE”. Then he told me to pay at exit. As usual, I pay at the machine on P3 level EVERY SINGLE TIME.

"The Hilton is across the road from the central train station making it really accessible for business travellers coming into KL.The staff are really helpful and good to organise you taxis and ensure you get directions to where you want to go. It is also very easy to walk across to the nearby shopping centres or to local offices.  The restaurants are also very good at the hotel - especially the Sashimi which was the best I have eaten anywhere.....just loved it.  The rooms are all a good size, comfortable and the executive lounge gives good views across the city (but not towards the main areas).  In all I would recommend for anyone travelling on business - if sightseeing you may want to choose a hotel close to the centre or the Petronas towers.",4,0.9882

"The Deluxe King room that I was given had a faulty flush. I had to call the front desk, not once, but twice, before someone finally came up to repair it. Waited about 15-20 minutes before I could leave my room. Wondered why the faulty flush was not identified during housekeeping before I was allocated the room.   The furnishings were also having some wear and tear. The cupboard that housed the mini bar couldn't close fully, while one of the bathroom taps was slightly protruding from the wall. The air-con was also not cold enough. I tried to lower the temperature to make the room colder, but the air-con controls doesn't allow me to set below 20 degrees.

"So disappointed about this time. When I was checking in，the assistant said he can't find my booking information. Then the manager said she would give me response quickly by herself. But after the whole day，I got nothing.  I marked that I prefer to live in high floor when I was booking. However, I lived in the low floor. The assistant said he would exchange it for me the next day. Just give me the room in 15th. And nobody help me move my luggage.  One day in the noon，the waiter came into my room without knock and bell. I was sleeping well in that time. Very annoyed. Although I lived here for nine days this time. I still can't score the point and use wifi. I'm the member of Hilton honors .  In short, very disappointed about this time.",4,-0.5689

Room service was very prompt and laundry service was expensive but professional. Out of three Kl sentral hotels I’ve tried, Kl Hilton win in all these aspects mentioned. But I have two problems with them that can’t be fixed easily - 1) their toilet seat is 20pct-30pct smaller than a standard toilet seat. Might not sound like a big deal but it puts you in a semi squat position, might not be comfortable for some people. 2) The bigger problem I had was the inconsistent temperature of the water from shower, the water temperature can’t be set still.

We could have taken the quick and efficient train but as we had our suitcases and just wanted to get to the hotel with no real idea of how far the station was from it, the taxi made sense for us at the time and the cost was similar at less than MR 120 for 2 people with luggage. Traffic was good on the motorway but it was very busy as we got closer to the hotel and the trip took over an hour so on reflection, the train would have been better but we were in no rush.

Certainly the waitress Ismawati is very friendly, a waitress whom dedicates herself a lot in the restaurant. She's very patient and could explain the food ingredients very well.",5,0.9551
"Spotlights: * Next to KL Sentral &amp; huge shopping malls w/ lots of indoor passages, needn't worry about scorching sun or rainy days. * Spectacular lake view on the 34F (top floor is 35F). * Hearty &amp; tasty breakfast buffet w/ multi-cultural choices: Malaysian, Islamic, Japanese, Western, etc. * Big pool &amp; fully equipped gym, and they provide SPA service. * Toiletries from Crabtree &amp; Evelyn, refreshing scent &amp; fresh texture. * Fast water-filling bathtub, super time-saving &amp; comfy. * Best bed I've ever slept on, extra king size.  Pity: * Hope there was more lighting in the sleeping area, rather dark at night. * There weren't many movie channels (no HBO, FoxMovies, etc.), such a waste of the huge-screen TV.

"Note: this is part 2 of a series of 3 hotel KL hotel reviews I will write in the next 2 months.   The Hilton is what you'd expect from the chain.   Everything is perfunctorily good but nothing in particular stands out as good or bad.   Breakfast is good with the usual variety.  Taste vice - does not quite taste like local food but passable.   The juice bar will custom make your order - so that was a nice bonus.    A safety feature I appreciates was that vehicles are screened before permitted to drive up to the hotel.    It is practically across the street from the KL Sentral  easy access to the KLIA express, metro lines and train services), so really convenient in that aspect.   It is pricey ( starting at USD100/ night), just like the Gardens (Part 1).   I'd prefer this hotel to",4,0.9674

"I was only staying in KL for one night on a Asia trip, but so glad I chose the Hilton Kuala Lumpur. A week before my arrival, I received a personal email from the hotel manager, affording me the opportunity to let them know of my late arrival, and request a late checkout, which was promptly confirmed. Despite arriving at 2am, reception was fully manned and I was quickly checked-in with an upgraded room for my Diamond Status. The room was modern and exceptionally clean, with a wonderful bathroom and spacious. I missed breakfast, but took advantage of the Executive Lounge which was manned all day with drinks and refreshments available between main meal times. Overall the service provide was attentive, friendly and polished...I'm looking forward to a longer stay next time. Location",5,0.9809
Was back again @ Hilton KL in December. The staff were excellent as usual especially staff at the Ex Lounge. Team lead Jim Ho recognized me and greeted me right away. The staff were very attentive and pay attention to to details from check-in to check-out. I have always had a great enjoyable and relaxing stay at the Hilton KL and look forward to returning.,5,0.9364
"Couple of months back, was in KL on business and felt ripped off when the hotel I stayed in charged me 150 ringit to get to the airport in a standard taxi so this time I decided on the Hilton as I could get the train-what a difference! a return ticket from KLIA to KL Sentral is 90 ringit and takes a half hour as opposed to double that in a taxi. So thursday night I arrived late into this Hilton feeling tired, hungry and grumpy. Was checked in by a charming young man who gave me a lovely room and whilst I had missed restaurant service was advised I could get a drink in the bar on floor 5 and room service was available for food. went to said bar where a live band was playing and whilst it was a bit too noisy for me, the place was packed and everyone seemed to be enjoying",5,0.7901
Our group of foodies &amp; shoppers wanted to checkout the stores &amp; restaurants in KL prior to Chinese New Year. Staying at the Hilton Sentral seems convenient and familiar faces amongst the service staff put us well at ease. We also enjoy the breakfast buffet spread before we charge out to the malls.,5,0.7783

Today me and my friend have lunch together at vasco hilton kl. I was impressed by their 'golden money bag with fatt choy abalone sauce' and 'loh hon zai'. The Chinese food was fully prepared by the chef from Chynna(Chinese restaurant). Their beef black pepper is good. I believe if put on some green vegetables would be perfect e.g leek. I was looking forward to try their peking duck serve during dinner buffet. Recommended to give a try.,5,0.9422
"Check-in for Gold and Diamond members is done at the seating area in the lobby. I was offered a one-level  upgrade to a corner room on the 34th floor (one below the top floor). Not bad for a 7-nights stay!  The breakfast spread at Vasco’s restaurant is massive! Get’s pretty crowded though. The tables are very close to one another and you will literally be bumping elbows with someone else’s partner and listening to each other’s conversation.  The Executive Lounge on level 33 has a really nice panoramic view. The food offerings for afternoon tea and evening aperitifs are of good quality too. As my room is just one floor above, I could just walk down the grand staircase to get to the Executive Lounge. It gets full in the evening, so you will have to be there early to sit by the",5,0.9579

"First time stay at this hotel and the room design is terrible. It stated in the website the room is 44 sqm but it looks much smaller feel very small. Space design is very bad and hardly any space to move around. Practically the whole room design does not feel comfortable to stay in. It is more like a cheap boutique hotel feel. Whoever the designer who design the room layout is really not doing a good job. For guest, we wanted to comfortable room with a feeling of comfort and not this room. The shower area  floor a bit slippery  when wet. Also, not sure what kind of scent they use but the scent too strong and does not smell comfortable. When we checked out and get our parking card to be validate the concierge did not even informed us we need to pay a flat rate of RM3.00. Someone",1,-0.8425

Everything was perfect for my family and Ms. Sharmila Umi from the F&amp;B in KL Hilton Hotel was amazing in assisting me to organize this party. She is quick in replying, friendly and very precise in getting things organized according to my needs. Sharmila is also very compassionate when it came to waiting for my response, due to family emergency.

You can reach here straight from both Kuala Lumpur International Airport and Subang International Airport via their respective dedicated airport express trains. Additionally, you can also travel around Kuala Lumpur and Greater Kuala Lumpur via local transit trains conveniently. If you prefer to drive, it’s easy to navigate around the area (thank you, Google Maps/Waze) and private parking complex is available at the hotel (RM3 per entry for hotel guest).

Most of the hotel i called directly to check if they can get us the connecting room so my mother can be easily accessible with me in case any emergency, none of the hotels can confirm except when i call Ms Baiti from Hilton KL, she really take the extra effort and understand our condition and tried her level best to accommodate to our request, she managed get us to the Executive Lounge Level as thats the only rooms that she can arrange for connecting.

Booked a nice King room which was updated to a suite - mulch appreciated after such long flights to visit KL. When we entered the room we were delighted with it. Impeccably clean, beautiful view, gorgeous appointments, a full bath and powder room, and even a roomy walk in closet to store our things. It was delightful to put everything away and just enjoy this beautiful suite. Breakfast was an amazing assortment of fresh delicious food of every sort. I was happy to see you could order not just fresh eggs but even a juice. Every staff member in the restaurant was attentive, professional and their enthusiasm for a job well done",5,0.988

The rooms are well designed and kept spotlessly clean, breakfast is varied and stocked with quality items. Front desk staff are efficient and attentive with excellent language skills. In my experience they put the clients needs front and centre .Any issues and Win and her team get right on it. Hilton Honours members are recognised but this is not just a business hotel , it has more the feel of a resort hotel with an excellent pool,comfortable sunloungers and all day sun.

"If I’m visiting a city I’ve never been to before, the first hotels I check out are Hilton’s. And the Kuala Lumpur one didn’t disappoint. It’s a super nice hotel. The staff are very welcoming and accommodating and friendly. There was one waiter, (unfortunately I didn’t get his name) who remembered all our tea/coffee/hot chocolate choices everyday at breakfast. I loved the view from our room, overlooking the man-made lake. The breakfast was overwhelming like in most Hiltons – spoilt for choice and it had a mix of both Western and Asian foods. My check-in and check-out were smooth. I would definitely stay here again in the future! Thank you Hilton Kuala Lumpur.",5,0.9694
"Had a short trip to KL this time &amp; decided to give this property a try. Staff were super accommodating &amp; friendly(be it in every department, housekeeping, bellboy, front office) spacious room with super nice bathtub, in room dining was delicious, sadly my booking is not inclusive of breakfast, hence not too sure how it taste like but I'm pretty sure it will taste good as the IRD! Smooth check in &amp; check out too, kudos to the the FOM who check me in &amp; the guy who check me out👍🏼 Location wise, it’s pretty okay. Due to the heavy traffic especially at the famous tourist places like BTS, Pavillion etc, took us about 30mins almost an hr to get there from the property. Def not the hotel fault, but during normal days, I'm pretty sure it will take about 15-20mins to get to the city",5,0.9897
Stayed in the Hilton as it is easy to reach by KLIA.  Very nice rooms with a good bathroom. The rooms are very quiet with no street noise or noise from the hall way or neighbours.  The beds are really comfy and airco is functioning well.  USB charging outlet on the night stand is handy.  I had access to the executive lounge...probably one of the best I have visited. Great service.   The gym is very well equipped and there is a good pool with jacuzzi.   The Zest restaurant was really good with a wide choice of dishes and cuisines.   Last visit I stayed in one of the other hotels in the area but I prefer the Hilton. ,5,0.9084

"We booked into Hilton at KL for a weekend stay. The service was impeccable with friendly smiles right from the time we entered the entrance of the hotel. We chose a room on the high floor when checking in online and enjoyed the panoramic view, the green spaces from atop provided us with a different perspective on KL city.  The room was well appointed with a bathroom that has lots of  mirrors around.  Hilton KL is right next to Central station which is a transport hub for the city and across the country. There is also the convenience of taking an express train to airport from the station.   ",5,0.8934
"Had stayed at this hotel many times, rooms are ok, common areas ok, executive lounge is very good. Security in the hotel (with respect at whom they allowed in premises and/or the ones entering the hotel rooms) is somewhat questionable. Buffet style breakfast offer have a wide variety of American and international cuisines foods and beverages.  But to our surprise when my husband went to exchange some dollars into local currency they told him that they could not accept some of our $20 bills because there were printed prior to 2004. We travel extensively throughout Asia and exchanging older bills (only bills with tear corners or tape up ones aren’t accepted) had never been a problem!  That policy is Not acceptable specially at a Hilton chain hotel.",3,0.8994
"Hilton brands receive most of my business but Hilton KL was truly a fantastic surprise. Unfortunately we were only here one night but I would have loved to have stayed a week. Receiving a room upgrade certainly helped but the entire hotel was wonderful. Rooms were plush and clean with great views and just felt restful and peaceful.   The large meandering pool along with the spa is shared in a unique arrangement with Le Meridien next door and is similarly conducive to a long stay with ample room to find a quiet corner or enjoy the water slide or waterfall.   Breakfast was excellent and up to international standards.

I stayed here for 2 nights recently for a business visit. This hotel is in an extremely convenient location especially for business travellers. It connects seamlessly (sheltered access) to the KLIA express in KL Sentral. Furthermore there is also a Nu Sentral mall adjacent to the hotel.  The hotel itself has all the trappings that a business traveller can ask for. The amenities are fantastic especially the grill in the lobby and the Japanese restaurant. Rooms are spacious and offer a great view of the environs. Most importantly this hotel offers great value for money versus the other establishments in the vicinity.   I thank all the staff for the great welcome extended to me and I will return to stay here for my next business trip.,5,0.9788
Stayed here for 2 nights and i must say this hotel is the best hotel i ever stayed in Kuala Lumpur. The beds are comfortable and clean. Breakfast at the restaurant is delicious and they have wide variety as well. The pool is nice and relaxing. Staffs are friendly and always smiling. We went over to Zeta bar and we really had a great time there. We enjoy the music there and they have nice crowd.This hotel is located near shopping mall and its easy to make your way to anywhere. I highly recomend this hotel to all. Will be back here again if im in Kuala Lumpur.,5,0.9909
