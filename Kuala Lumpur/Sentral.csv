"I always travel alone to KL and for me it worth the price. I pay less than MYR100 for one night. The staffs also friendly. It is located near to the KL sentral. Plus, there are so many restaurants located in this area.",4,0.4019
"This hotel is just walking distance to the KL Sentral station which is perfect is you will be going around Kuala Lumpur. NU Sentral Mall is in the same location which is very convenient. Across the hotel are some restaurants serving good food and coffee that are just right in the budget.  The hotel amenities are basic but really good value for the money especially for budget-conscious traveler like me. We also availed the free breakfast which they serve at the 5th floor. The hotel staff are not very friendly, except for the young man who cleaned our room every day [we stayed at the 12th floor]. He was the only one who was courteous and smiling.  There's a water refilling machine near the elevator, and also an iron. Our room was clean, no complaints at all.  I can say that this",5,0.9692
"For it's price, this hotel sure surpasses any notions we would have had about it before going. Nothing fancy, but basics at its best. Very clean with very helpful staff. Excellent location smack in the middle of KL city, within short walking distance to KL Sentral (KL's main transportation hub) and NuSentral mall where one can satiate one's shopping desires, watch movies, good eateries etc. It's also located near KL's Little India (Brickfields) where you can find good Indian food eateries and Indian costumes, jewellery etc. Would definitely recommend for those on a budget, as its well worth every cent.",5,0.9915
I would not recommend this hotel to any one. Staff are very rude. Also the hotel is not clean at all. I wouldn't recommend to any one else. Better to check NU hotel which is opposite to it which looks very good.,1,-0.3975
"Please train your young male receptionist who is rude and doest have customer-oriented attitude at all. Train him to give respect to guests. We arrive at 3 PM but we got our rooms almost at 5 PM. The reason given was guests checking out late and they are paying the late fees. No bottled water in the room. Guest have to get filtered water from the dispenser way out in the corridor. Insects crawling in the room, maybe it is a norm in this hotel. There is an ironing board and iron available at a corridor. Carpets are very old and torn. I don't recommend this hotel for a family stay, there are better options available nearby this hotel.",2,-0.4235
"Good Location, OK rooms, Cockroach, Rooms are old hence check the doors sometimes it does not open, no bar, no restaurant, Male receptionist is very rude. If you want to spend only night sleeping then good hotel.",3,0.8184
"We were family of 3 (including 1 child) and stayed in this hotel for 6 hours and here is the findings - there were cockroaches in the bathroom, no hot water to take bath - when complaint to reception and house keeping atleast 8-10 times - they dint even made any effort to support. Breakfast was extra ordinary.. just dont recommend this for family stay",1,-0.4234
 Good room with good wifi range but no toothpaste n toothbrush because we expected that they’d have it for us. But It was fine because there was a mark 7-Eleven in front of our hotel and we just bought it from that,4,0.3182
"Greeted by the rudest young male  receptionist Ive ever encountered. Spoken to like dirt. Zero eye contact. He knows who he is with the dark framed glasses. Room given stunk of smoke on smoking floor even though my booking stated non smoking. TV channels useless. No bottled water with a filtered water dispenser way  out in the corridor. Cheap! A crawling insect that you might normally find in a dirty kitchen was running up our bathroom wall in the morning. But it was the staff rudeness that annoyed me the most. If you dont like your job, find a new one. Dont take it out on paying guests.",1,-0.9286
"Only great thing about it is the location, near to KL Sentral and the monorail station. Hotel is starting to show its age. I stayed in a Deluxe Room but it didn't feel any more special than a Superior Room. Air conditioning is centralized, and was weak indeed: adjusting the control dials didn't improve things. Give the TV a miss - mostly local channels, which isn't many to begin with. Surprisingly the safe was missing from my room.  Breakfast will be filling enough if you don't set 4 or 5-star expectations. The following items feature every day: fried rice, fried noodles, fresh fruit, frankfurters (chicken),  rice congee, noodles with soup, bread/toast, cereals (I swear the milk on offer had been diluted with water!). On different days, the following might feature: roti canai,",3,0.8914
"The worst hotel experience I had so far. Bad service, extremely unfreindly staff, worst front desk ever, dirty enviorenment, No wifi and no respect for guests. Terrible value for money. Specialy the front desk, they are not even reachable. I spent 5 nights and no wifi for all days and they did not even care to fix it",1,-0.967
"I like to stayed in this hotel because of the location close to KL Sentral and the room also nice and comfort for stay. Only the staff in front desk little bit unfriendly no smiling and unwelcoming face to the guest, they suppose to be friendly with smiley face because they incharge infront the house. Over all is good i like this hotel with don't care they face in Front desk.",3,0.9362
"Stayed at tis lousy hotel for almost 1 week. Firstly when checking in the hotel, the front line treats u as though u r invisible. They r very very rude. No manners when speaking to guess.  The food is the worst. The food taste so stale. ",1,-0.9314
"Worst hotel on the price being charged. Uncomfortable bed, unclean carpets, rude front office, basic breakfast. Handling of staff like a guest house.  Location is good so they take advantage of this. Very bad staff.",1,-0.8238
Hotel Sentral is located in the heart of the city and can easily catch a train from Airport to hotel in 30 minutes and Room and Hotel is good and maintains is also good and I always pefer to stay for business stay in Kuala Lampur,4,0.802
Checked-in reception without any smile or welcoming. 2. Room had cockroaches. Caught 4 small ones as proof. Changed rooms without apologies and I had feeling that there was complicity.   I will not stay there again.,2,0.316
Stayed a few times everytime I visit KL This time round staff attitude really upsad me  Me and me friend were there for my birthday celebration. Upon arriaval about 7pm at counter male staff did not greet or smile ... he pointed his colleague beside after I told him that I wish to check-in... the lift was smelly. I have been given room 424 &amp; 426 as compared to pass few stay our rooms this time round do not equip with safety box &amp; mini-bar. My room 424 not even comes with “do not disturb” card. I have called front desk and requested for the card but after 25min.. nothing happened. On check-out day I went out for breakfast with my friend and return to hotel about 11.15am. We realized that our card has been deactivated. I went to look for staff at front counter. Male staff did not,1,0.6755
The lift was smelly might be due to the septic tank underneath the building. Room was small and a bit congested for couple. Very basic amenities and shouldn't rate as 3 stars. Cleanliness can be improved further.,3,0.4767
"Pros: 1) Good location 2) self service laundry just opposite the hotel 3) complimentary parking for in-house guests 4) cheap price — but price tells the quality  Cons: 1) old facilities, totally different from the photos 2) I requested high floor &amp; non smoking room but gave me the first room at 2nd floor &amp; there is ashtray with many cigarette burst marks on the carpet 3) breakfast just so-so and not many varieties  4) housekeeper not well trained — when he moved the extra bed that we requested  to combine with the queen size bed, there were rubbish under the queen size bed, he used his hand to sweep into the bed instead of pick the rubbish up!!  I asked him vacuum the floor and he acted didn’t listen what I said.   5) dirt stain found on the pillow 6) No amenities provided 7) No",1,-0.5114
"The hotel is in Brickfields (Little India) area and just a few meters from the NU Sentral and KL Sentral. Hence it is superbly connected with the public transport. The best part is water dispensers on each floor, you can fill in your water bottles from them and don't have to pay anything. The hotel does not even charge any security deposit like high end hotels. The lifts are quick. The room size is a little small hence you get a very limited shower area however the shower pressure is pretty good. The bathroom doors don't have locks. There are umpteen options of Indian food nearby and international food chains in the malls hence no worries on that front. The breakfast is decent with 2-3 vegetarian options as well however the ice tea and orange juice provided are super watery. For",4,0.9202
I stayed 4 days. All these days they provided the same variety of morning breakfast that too it was not good. That don't even provide water bottles. Worst reception experience i ever had. Dont stay here,1,-0.7584
"First night stayed in room 415 have poor aircondition they provided a fan i have not slept well next day they changed to 1009 it was with bad smell, break fast poor have no option only Malay food I have not taken.",2,-0.8863
"We were tired, we had flown all night with a chihuahua in the seat next to us, and had an argument at the airport - all of these circumstances led up to the booking of Sentral Hotel. Sure the location is central, but that’s about it. The whole hotel feels very uninspiring and you get the feeling they were happy to bank your money and after that every effort to make your stay pleasant stops. The staff was actually quite rude and laughed at us for enquiring about the differences in prices from booking sites compared to walk ups.   Hotel Sentral, you have a decent building and a good location, please step up!!",2,0.9489
Room smelled of cigarettes even through I had a non smoking room in 13th Floor. Front counter people need to be educated on how to be polite as the security personal we’re much better then them when asking for directions or help. Room was terrible with aircon don’t know if it is working or not and seem to have a life of its own. Positive tone is the Housekeeping does a good job in cleaning the room. Definitely not staying there ever again.,1,0.9201
"I had been stay for 2 night at this hotel. Overall is good for traveller when you are spend whole the day outside. The room is enough for take a rest and very clean. The price was also okay for me not too expensive. Location is close with NU sentral shopping mall including KL Sentral as a transportation Hub among KL city destination. My feedback is please improve the hospitality to services the guest better i.e with smile, say hello etc.",3,0.9468
"My family and I have been frequent customers to Hotel Sentral for years but the recent visit had left a very bad impression for us. The breakfast standard had dropped tremendously. On one of the days,  the menu served were of vegetarian choices without any meat products or eggs. The air-con in our room was not strong. The customer service refused to tell us the wifi password infact he merely laughed it off and said the wifi was bad anyway and that we were better off not knowing the password, leaving us standing in front of the counter like fools.  But when my sister called and spoke in proper english to him over the phone, he (the same guy) gave her without question ask. The hotel did stated that the wifi was free anyway so why the different services rendered. I am both angry",1,-0.8467
"Sure the hotel is centrally located but... 1. The room smelt of smoke, even had an ashtray despite many reassurances that it was a non-smoking room. 2. The aircon was not working optimally, dripping water into the room. Even had mould around the AC unit. 3. General lack of cleanliness,  cockroaches in the room, filthy curtains, towels were old and worn, off white colour 4. Breakfast was utterly disappointing with watery milk and juice and very limited selection  Couldn't wait to check out ☹, fortunately only had a short stay scheduled.",1,-0.8715
"Stayed for business trip Apr 14 for 4 nights.  Initially booked for a deluxe room but was upgraded to an ""exec room"" as they're fully booked. No complaint about this.  This is when the bad service started: - I wasnt informed that the room is a smoking room. I only found out when Im already in the room and started to smell cigar in the entire room. - I asked to be transferred but no avail room at the moment. I still sleep in there for the night as Im tired from the flight.  - next morning before going to the office I approached front desk and spoke to a guy and he doesnt seem to be in a good mood. He is not friendly at all and when I asked to be transferred, he asked details from me in an irritable tone. He said I need to check out and grab my things and can only transfer at 2pm.",1,-0.9704
It is a great place to stay in KL because it is located behind KL sentral where all public transport meet. The room is fair enough. We stayed there for three nights and they clean it well everyday. Our room has a nice city view as on picture. The breakfast menu was changed everyday so we didn't get bored. Another great thing is there are lots of restaurants and shopping mall just in front of it. So it is very easy to grab foods and stuffs😉,4,0.9687
Good  hotel and easy to reach from airport. Excellent break fast felt comfortable to stay in hotel. Location of hotel is centre of of kl and can do shopping near and around. The food at arya bavan and mtr was good,4,0.9413
"The hotel is very suitably located near Sentral Station once you have worked out how to find it. No complaints about the standard in terms of what it cost. Breakfast was fine. They looked after my bags but I had to wait until 2pm to be able to access my room. I wonder if more flexibility might have been extended (assuming they were not compoletely full, which I doubt).",3,0.359
"Our room aircon was not working and the room had a smell. Beds were not very comfortable and too low. Room had several  cockroaches. Credit to the supervisor he changed the room when we complained almost immediately. In the new room the space was more and the aircon worked. The breakfast was a disaster, very few options and food that was poor in taste. The bread ran out early. The way they check you in at breakfast as thought people would cheat to get in there.l to eat that food. The cleaning staff were immaculate in their work. Location is good, there are enough shops and food places around. Monorail is next to hotel and the main station is in the Nu sentral mall less than 5 minutes walk away.",2,-0.9085
"stayed here for 3 nights and upon arrival no luggage assistance was offered. we came to front desk to inform about the itchiness and red spots on the skin which believed the bed has bed bugs but we were questioned by the front desk to give the proof and they reluctant to get the manager to meet us. We dont expect anything, it just to tell them for further action such as to get pest control or to spray the bed accordingly. But we were given a respond from the staff seems like we are cheating . We dont blame the staff as i can see they lack of the skills in handling that such of situation and seems like no knowledge what to do next. I would suggest for the  management to give adequate hospitality training to the staff. I would definitely will give another try to stay here in",1,-0.1017
Very bad service with very bad reception people we came with a child with two baggages bt no any help to bagges to room. Offered a room which should go to by staircases so very much terrible. No any pleasant help from reception people I recommend to not to go there again  Very disappointed about their bad behavior specially reception lady with tall man  This is the first time visit to Malaysia bt never ever again to Malaysia,1,-0.9166
"The room was very unhygienic, mould on the walls and ceilings and the curtains. Aircon leaking water (guess this is what caused the mould). On the cheaper side however would still expect a lot more for what we paid. Internet did not work in our room we had to sit in the corridor. Fridge did not work and shower had no door. Hot water did not work, told staff and it was fixed to Luke warm. Not someone who would normally complain but I would not recommend this please and definitely would not stay here again. We had a late flight out of KL so after check-out sat in the lobby out of the way to kill time, charge phones and use the wifi and got kicked out.   Hotel is central (as the name states) which is good if you wanna walk to explore. Catching a train here was quite easy and just",1,0.6324

Close location to the central train station and shopping centres makes it ideal stay .Good sized room but the decor could use updating. Staff not very approachable and looked agitated at most times. Did not eat at hotel as there are numerous eating places all around .,3,-0.2144
"I generally stay at Hotel Sentral whenever I’m in KL for a couple of days. It’s a good budget option with an ideal location.  The proximity to public transport is perfect. It’s a 3 minute walk to the MRT station which takes you to popular restaurant/bar area Bukit Bintang amongst other places. It’s a 5/10 minute walk (through the mall) to other trains at KL Sentral, including the airport train and shuttle buses.  It’s also quiet convenient for restaurants and shopping. Across the streets there are two restaurants that serve a variety of food, including popular breakfast such as roti chanai. In 5 minutes you’re at NU Sentral shopping mall where you can find a good variety of chain restaurants and stores. There is also a cinema. The rooms are sufficient, the bed is comfortable and",4,0.9674
"Good Location to have all communication in sorter distance and nice mid value room. Hospitality was good, surrounded with lots of restaurants and shops. near is the mail KL Sentral station have all metros of KL",4,0.875
"We chose this hotel because of its location. It is roughly 200 Metres from the most important Metro station and hence well connected. Our room had a lovely view of the Station and the huge Mall next to it. (see picture attached).  As we were constantly loafing, we did not eat any meal except the breakfast. There isn't a huge choice in the breakfast menu, perhaps because it is a budget hotel. But the fare was decent, no complaints. If you are Indian, then there is a bonus. This hotel is in Brickfields, the heart of the Indian quarter. You can easily find  Indian restaurant-chains (or even roadside cafes) that serve Indian food! The rooms are small but neat--- Ideal for people who are out all day and only need a nice place to crash for the night.Housekeeping was efficient and",5,0.9436
"A colleague injured her leg and was facing difficulties in walking. Early check in was rejected although only 40 mins prior to 12pm. The front office leaded by a Ms Foo needs to be either retrained or just leave the service industry. Very disabled UNFRIENDLY HOTEL. Disappointed as a corporate customer we book this hotel frequently and got this kind of service. AC was not working the last day we were there. Once again, front office very rude and all they could do was give a table fan. Rooms were smelly and very dirty carpets. Breakfast was just horrible. Spoke to James, the GM, cost cutting measures he said.   If you are planning of staying, eating or buying this hotel, please reconsider. Almost everyone in the front office is rude. Saw a Chinese tourist being totally ignored",1,-0.9794
"This is a good budget place with friendly staff and decent rooms. Though we can't really call it a hotel but it's more of a bed and breakfast. The place is old and needs renovation as the hallway carpets are dirty and smell of moisture. I was in a executive room on the 15th floor and it was spacious enough. Location is absolutely great. My room had a view of the KL skyline including the KL tower which was spectacular. KL central, monorail and nu sentral mall are a stones throw away which was perfect for us as our intention was to travel and not spend much time in the room. We stayed for one week. ",4,0.907

Really bad front desk staff! No improvement! Unfriendly! ",1,-0.8956
Average budget hotel. Dont expect too much from the hotel. Good for the price. Definitely not a place with family. The bathrooms are too small. Rooms are just ok.

"Staying 2 nights in KL I chose this hotel due to location. It was in an alright locations you are right next to a train station but not to much in walking distance from it. The room was dull and pretty unclean to be honest, there was a lot of dirt around the air con. The staff were quite rude and unhelpful. Cheap stay but I wouldn't stay here again.",2,-0.2118
"As the hotel says; Hotel Sentral. It may not be in the CBD. However the 'Sentral' monorail/train-station was just one street away (less than 2 mins walk), and this station was all lines come into one station. It felt like you were at an airport it was huge. The station was really well set out and it a massive draw card for this hotel. Travel to any part of KL from there. Also very large multi story mall, with all the services you could need. The hotel itself was nice. Bathroom nice and clean. However the walls and objects (eg. phone) needed a clean as there were dirty marks on them... The lift also rekked! I don't know if someone left a durian in there for weeks but it smelt gross so we opted for the 3 flights of stairs most days.",3,0.4192

This hotel is located quite close to KL Sentral railway station although it is down a back street. Complete with suitcases it is only a two minute walk to KL Sentral across cobble stoned alleyways but don't be put off by that as I found all areas in the vicinity to be completely safe to travel alone night and day. Many restaurants close by as are breakfast bars at incredibly low prices by Australian standards.The room I chose had no windows , was perfectly clean and well presented , serviced promptly each day.

"For the rate, it’s a just decent hotel. Abit on the old side but located right at the station coming from KLIA. Basically it’s a place where many Indians gather, even the food places there are mainly catered for them. Hence if Indian food isn’t on your top list, you should stay somewhere else. For those who venture, the coffee shop across ABC which sells a variety of Indian food is pretty good and prices very reasonable. Next to the hotel is a nice Thai massage that opens till 1am. They do have pretty good foot massage as well. There’s a convenience store next to the hotel and a 7-11 across the road. This hotel comes with the smoking and non smoking room.

In fact we found the externally employed security guards more engaging.  The hotel rooms looked like they were in bad need of a renovation. Bottled water was provided and rooms were cleaned daily.   we didn't realise that there was a mosque located directly behind the hotel that broadcasted the azam (call to prayer) on loud speakers from its minoret. This may annoy some patrons as the 5 key prayer times (solat) begin with calls to prayer early in the morning and late at night.

"Stayed in this hotel from Dec 22 - dec 25 , 2017. I had a deal from one of the online sites. I would say hotel allots you a room based on how much you pay. So, do  not get excited if you get a deal where you paid less.   Initially the room allocated to me was too small that I started to get suffocated. When i reported this to reception, the receptionist was very rude and asked me to check with online website. Hotel didn't allow me to check in even an hour earlier than the hotel check in time, SAD!

Upon too much of argument, I was given another room but the receptionist words still cannot make up for that.

Regretted letting them book us accommodation at all, but they claimed they had a good relationship with the hotel and it was a good place to be.  We paid about £30 a night and had heard that this amount should go a long way in terms of value. It didn't.  Firstly the hotel is located very close to KL sentral train station and the monorail, very very convenient.  But it's dirty, tired, unwelcoming, unsafe, noisy, and full of bed bugs.   The area, whilst convenient, is not pleasant and walking round at night should come with precaution.

"My husband and I stayed at Hotel Sentral for one night. Hotel conditions are not well since it's not a new one. The rooms are old and the facilities are not well maintained. What makes this hotel a good choice is it's location! The location of Hotel Sentral is great that you can easily access any kind of transportation and most of the facilities such as shopping center, money exchange and convenient store within 5 mins. at max. There is a shopping mall called Nu Sentral next to hotel. To reach the main transportation hub KL Sentral you basically go inside of the mall from the gate next to Family Mart, go to the upper floor and follow the signs to hub  on your left and come out from the gate next to Victoria's Secret.

My employer said I shouldn't pay because I am here for employment and not as a tourist. But the personnel claimed I still should pay for it so I just did as per Malaysian government policy. I checked out 1 day earlier and the personnel asked me for another RM50 for another tourist fee for the next day that I won't be staying in their hotel. I asked for their explanation why I should pay for the day that I wont be staying, and he said it's hotel's policy since my employer booked 5days and I checked out on the 4th day.

"On a recent trip with my wife to KL we decided to stay at this hotel. The main deciding factor was that it was located in Little India and we were hopeful to see the Diwali festivities. The Hotel itself is one of the few high rise in the area and is  much more appealing than the shanty looking hotels around it. The staff were pleasant and rooms cleaned daily. While the common areas like the corridors could do with some work, as they are musty and not brightly lit, the rooms are spacious, clean and offer a decent view of the city.

I asked if we could pay a fee and get in doesn't that mean a room is available, but he just kept insisting that we had to come back at 2pm, maybe 10/11am if we were lucky.  When we did come back at 10am we spoke to the service manager who told us if we wanted an early check in we would have to pay RM80, but that we could leave our bags there if we wanted.

"The biggest suite in the Hotal Sentral (Rm 1501) is far cheaper that a standard room in a 5-star hotel. It has a very large bedroom/sitting area with an adjacent dressing room and the usual en-suite. It had been recently painted and was very clean. The housekeeper was very conscientious. Breakfast (included) was 4-star standard.  The Hotel Sentral is almost attached to Sentral rail station and monorail, so travel and communications are excellent, and is separated by a large modern shopping mall so that noise is not a problem.  The reception/check out desk was understaffed at peak times which led to some grumpiness from the staff. This has been commented on in previous reviews.  I will certainly stay in room 1501 again.",5,0.8847

They charge a refundable deposit of 50MYR  during checkin and a Non-refundable 10MYR per day tourism tax. I am not sure what that is for.  If you just want a place to sleep after a day's roaming , this is a good bet.",3,0.9101

At the lower floors we stayed in, the windows were opposite the Sentral Monorail Station. If you are a light sleeper, you will get woken up early by the Monorail, Traffic and the call to prayer from the mosque yards away from the hotel.

Was old and rundown hotel.   Amenities and was lacking and surrounding was a distance to major shopping centre in KL.   Kettle was found to be rusty and called for replacement but counter staff was not helpful.  You can come down from your room to the lobby to get warm water inlieu getting a replacement kettle. Isn't hilarious!  Eventually,  replacement was given but nightmare.  Whole room electrical was tripped off after the replaced kettle was pluged in.

It consisted of Asian and Western cuisine.  Lots of fresh fruit too.  If I found one fault, it is that the entire hotel needs a re-paint, both inside and out.

The negative things about the hotel is the rude and greedy front desk, They are least bothered about the customer needs, all they want is the money.

Well, the LRT station was practically next to the hotel. And you can also get a bus to the airport, Genting Higland, and some other destinations from KL Sentral.  There's a 7-Eleven across the hotel.
