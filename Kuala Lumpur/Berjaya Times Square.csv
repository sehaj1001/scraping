"The location of the hotel is very good, the room service were excellent, it also has a shopping mall which contain restaurants and cafes. The staff are very friendly. And in the breakfast you have many to choices as there is a variety of dishes.",4,0.8856
"I'm not sure whats happened here. This was my 7th time staying here but I feel everything has gone downhill a bit in the past 2yrs. Check-in took ages although reception did give me a room number that I requested in a polite and patient manner. I did pay for 3 days of breakfasts but when I arrived the 1st morning my name wasn't on the list so I couldn't go in until I produced the receipt as proof of payment. They were polite again though. There's no-one attending the pool area until midday now so you can't get a drink or pool towels. Lots of little faults in the room which I didn't bother complaining about but I did mention them on check-out so they can be fixed for the next guest. Faults included phone didn't work, bedside lamp didn't work, wardrobe light stopped working.",3,-0.8126
"What an incredible hotel and an absolute pleasurable stay. We opted for a club room / club lounge option which we’d thoroughly recommend. The staff are all lovely with nothing being too much trouble.  James at the Big Apple Resturant for breakfast is a master of the Coffee machine and just a genuinely lovely guy.  This hotel is very mindful of the current virus situation with hand sanitizer everywhere for personal use. 10/10 for everyone from the reception staff, wait staff and the cleaning staff you’ve all got customer service 100% correct!!! We will come and stay again on our next visit to KL. M+M Room2021 (Australians)",5,0.9448
"Had a pleasant stay at this hotel.  The hotel is in a great location, right next to the monorail station so can easily get around Bangkok. With regards to the rooms, it seems that some rooms are very old.  We had an issue with one of our rooms, reported it and the management immediately moved us to the newly renovated rooms, after which we had a comfortable and enjoyable stay.  Nice variety of food available at breakfast.  Great service provided by all staff in the hotel.  Would definitely recommend, however this is more like a 3 star hotel than a 4 star - only because some rooms are very old.",4,0.9837
"Large, comfortable rooms with views of the  city skyline.  Centrally located with a lot of visitor attractions within walking distance.  Access to BTS shopping mall through the hotel, Imbi monorail station is just outside, and Bukit Bintang is about 10 minutes walk from the hotel.  Staff are all very helpful, friendly and professional, which really enhanced my stay.  Good value for money accommodation.",4,0.9514
"Decided to stopover for a night from Melaka to Penang. Well, just utilizing part of my RM1000, courtesy from Malaysia government. Check in, check out, breakfast, all good. Heart of the city, convenient to commute if you are not driving.",5,0.7579
"We had to cancelled our reservation from the other nearby hotel due to a construction and noise, and inconvenient. First, what really drew our attention was we saw this Berjaya Times, was crowded, very clean, with few security guards or well dressed gentlemen standing in front those doors. First impression, was great, and we decided to blind check in without checking online the pricing, as we normally do first. The front desk was super helpful, but somehow, our check in took 1.5-2 hrs long, that was not pleasant at the beginning. We went to the nearby shopping and grab some few fresh fruits, water, juice, and snacks before checking in after, and everything turned out smooth and great! The room was spectacular great, and comfy bed, couch, great setting of TVs, restroom, few",5,0.9781

"This hotel is centrally located within walking distance to China Town and night markets and has access to shopping mall.  If you are travelling with children the mall connected to the hotel has it own theme park.   The food at the hotel is reasonable prices but drinks are very expensive. We went to the local KK store for spirits and beers for the best prices as suggested by one of our tour guides. Hotel service was very good with staff very friendly.  Rooms were comfortable, not luxury.  Bed and linen/pillows were very good. The hotel has a nice large pool, gym and squash courts all included in the price.  We found the wifi fast and reliable.",5,0.9878
"I booked this hotel thru booking.com. Checkin slow and difficult was done thru agents not hotel. The room they gave me was not one i chose and didn't deliberately pick this because of reviews. the wifi dropped out first night came on next day then dropped out next day they came to check said they would come back at 8 pm i went to bed 1030 and they woke me up at 1130 to fix it, the communication was difficult as i could only contact thru wifi which didnt have. When i checked out they cancelled booking so i could not write a review . Be very careful booking this hotel. ",2,-0.6258
"Very disappointed with their rooms and how they handled the situation.  Spoilt aircon : 2618 Power trip: 2408  Checked in into a room which had something wrong with the aircon and was given another room. Then comes the power trip at 2am leaving me in a dark room. Thankfully I had someone in the other room. The maintenance team came, fixed it and didnt even apologise that it happened. Instead he told me to switch off the heater switch which I didnt even on in the first place.",2,-0.7075
Good location in the heart of KL and next to LRT station. Connected to the mall. Big rooms with living area.  Hotel has seen better times. Room was smelly from odour in the toilet. Clogged sewerage likely cause. Changed rooms willingly. Shakey bed. Conditioner tube was empty. Aircon needed 10mins to warm up. S$95/ per night. Friendly staff.,3,0.8442
"We checked in at 3:30am on 01FEB2020 although we booked on 31JAN2020.We were told by the reception that she was going to give us a bigger room which was much appreciated. When we reached the room, it felt that the room was somekind of staff room or something. There was a note on the door stating that not to OFF the fridge as there was frozen food. ( I kept the pic of the note). The flushing system did not work. You got to flush 2 to 3 times. The sink also choked. The service during breakfast service was apalling. I was lining up for the prata or roti cannai counter with 3 person infront of me, it took so long for the chef to prepare the prata. Then only were told it was in the bowl at the side. I told the chef called Sulaiman that I wanted prata with eggs and he just glared at",1,0.1531
"I have been for 2 night in that apart hotel, huge by size but seems lack of maintenance, too hot in the corridors, bedroom aircon regulator defect, noisy aircon unit is stuck to the bedroom.But now the positive excellent location surrounded by 4 huge mall, excellent breakfast with all kind of food,  all Halal do not expect to get any bacon or pork sausage.....",3,0.9001
Club Lounge is a must! Delicious buffet breakfast and evening canapés and drinks included. Good value for travelling families. Rooms are large and comfortable. Hotel itself is a little aged but if you don’t care about image as much as practicality and good value then this hotel is great.,5,0.976
"Pros: - Location (beside imbi monorail)  Cons: -Faulty ameneties : The iron was faulty &amp; the telephone was not working -Missing amenities: Some amenities listed were not provided such as soap dish, bathrobe and etc.  -Poor housekeeping: Got my phone fixed on my last day of stay after telling them since day 1 &amp; I had to call the receptionist for housekeeping using my personal phoneas as room was not cleaned (we went out in the morning &amp; came back in the evening and the room was not being cleaned the trash bin was still full.) Guest folders were torn.  -Poor room condition: old &amp; need refurbishment. Room was smelly and the corridor had a very strong smoke smell.  I would never reccomend anyone or myself to stay in Berjaya Times Square Hotel. ",1,-0.7445
"An invigorating experience, to sum it all. Check-in and check-out were a breeze, and efficient-with plenty of info to find one’s compass within the immensity of the building. The staff was very friendly (my warmest thoughts to the breakfast and pool bar personnel, Messrs. Rana and MD Ayub Ali, to name a few), helpful, diligent and welcoming. The breakfast buffet spread is tantalising to all senses, and reflects the passion of the kitchen and waitron staff. Ideally located with a panoply of adjunct, easily accessible shops and eateries,  Berjaya Times Square remains a centrepoint of Malaysian culture. I strongly recommend. ",5,0.9778
"Great room and great view. Stayed at west 41-11 apartments where they give you one key for the room and one key for the elevator. If you are a party of two adults and one has the key in the room because they come from somewhere before you, you can't get to your room as a key is required to ride the elevator. The hotel concierge will NOT give you a key or take u up to ur floor  or let u call the ""manager"" of their room using your phone, but will play phone games or facebook in groups of 3-4 people at a time instead and will tell you to try walking 5-7 mins to the east wing and ""maybe someone can let u use the phone there"". They will also confidently tell you that ""this mall doesn't have sketchers store"" even though it's on the 1st floor in plain sight so u don't distract them",2,0.9428
"Lovely hotel. We stayed in club premier which gave us a large room and many other extras. Breakfast was good with plenty of choice. We felt the pool area could offer more. It lacked atmosphere. Also, lunch with a, a la carte menu was served in the breakfast area which was like a cafeteria. We had a really long wait for lunch and then part of it was  served cold. The staff were very apologetic and explained about the refurbishment in progress. All the staff we met were absolutely lovely.",4,0.9441
"1. Requested iron &amp; ironing board, was told that it took 10-15mins to be delivered to my room. I had to call 3 times and just forget about it as I need to head out for an appointment. That, in total was about 35mins of waiting time. 2. Found few strains of hair in the tub, bed sheet and pillows when I first entered the room. 3. Empty toilet roll left by the previous guest and housekeeping overlooked it. (It was under the sink) Throughout my entire 3 days stay, I can safely say that the housekeeper didn't really do their job.",2,-0.2023
"Without any doubt, my favorite hotel I stayed with my family during the last December in Kuala Lumpur. We were warmly welcomed by the Guest Service Manager by the name of Patricia. Most of all, staff was extremely friendly &amp; helpful. I enjoyed the spacious room &amp; the city view. The restaurant staff was very flexible in providing services to my family ( appreciate this ! ) . All respect &amp; special thanks to the Front Office Manager, Mr. Redzuan who does a great job here making my stay in Berjaya a memorable one. Without no hesitation, I would recommend Berjaya to my relations &amp; friends who's travelling to Kuala Lumpur &amp; wants easier access to city &amp; shopping mall which is just next to the hotel.

"I just visited Berjaya Hotel last week. I loved everything about the hotel. Very clean room, very delicious food for evening cocktail &amp; breakfast and very nice swimming pool. But i really do not satisfied with one thing, which is a receptionist. One of the receptionists at the club lounge was very rude when she repeated said that I was lucky to have a Club Premier room for only RM100. On the day I need to check out at 12noon, I called the reception to extend the check out and she said because I just paid for RM100, I just can extend the check out until 1.00pm only. Why she must mention and always repeated about I just paid RM100 for Club Premier Room? Is that my fault if I get the price that your hotel offered? It's not my fault at all but your staff's fault for why they offered",2,0.1914
"Spent 1 night with friend in this hotel, we had quite low expectations due to we paid with a low price which is 230 MYR per night in a studio room in a 5 star Hotel.   We did not expect any fancy service from what we paid, however the staff from the front office team had failed to impressed us with their service.   Check-in - 3 stars  We checked-in during the quiet time which is 4pm the lobby was not busy, there’s nobody greet us when we walk into the hotel lobby, we approached counter for check-in the lady who helping us to check-in was look like in pain, no smile and speaking in cold way.

Stayed here for 3 nights great hotel fantastic staff nothing to much to please you it was the Muslim Ramadan whilst we were there the only non plus is that the area the hotel is in is mostly alcohol free but not a problem because you can drink in the hotel .we tried the Ramadan special buffet night during Ramadan the choice of food of different cultures was a great experience the staff from the funny chatty bartender to the house staff looked after us we had a great massage there used the pool every day which is tucked away on the 15 th floor near the spa massage also right next to massive shopping mall just walk through hotel and your there good breakfast in hotel looked after us for our needs,4,0.9873
"We stayed 5 night in BTS Hotel. We requested quiet room, no connection doors and no smoking room too. We were lucky to get corner room so partly of our wishes met. Outside was big construction site and that made some annoynce. Gladly workers did not Bang, Bang during the night.  I belive that other travellers do not follow No Smoking requlations. Cigarette Smoke was really intense specially in toilet and Shower area. Smoke travel easily in aircon machines. Many fellow travellers from heavy smoking habit seen everywhere. My strong opininion they just not care, and they do what is good for them.  Club lounge was Ok and you get some cold and hot food and drinks too. First time in my travelling in Asia found out that, this hotel dont keep any diciplin for Flip flops, T-shirts etc.",4,0.8552
"This hotel has an ideal position being part of the Times Square Shopping Mall in Bukit Bintang in KL.  It has an excellent swimming pool area on the 15th floor and the staff are friendly and helpful. However, the building is aging and urgently in need of refurbishment and general maintenance. We had several rooms on our stay where the hot water did not work. This hotel has the worst check in procedure of any hotel I have ever visted around the world. On out last visit it took an hour for our group of 13 to be checked in.  Also we were not given any information about the hotel layout or facilities. Bukit Bintang is packed with hotels at the same price with better facilities.",2,0.8979

"the negatives outweighed the positives and although we only stayed two nights I wouldn't recommend or choose to stay again.   PRO: Rooms are large, Pillows wonderful. Staff are so kind, paitent and accommodating. Location to Berjaya Mall with cinema and theme park was novel.  Food in hotel delicious.   CON: cleanliness standard needs to be higher. Dust on furniture, dirt on floor and not enough towels. Mattress very hard, bath &amp; shower leak making floor wet &amp; slippery. Its worn and tired. Lifts are slow and always crowded due to high number of people staying.",3,0.7943
"We stayed 2 weeks at this hotel, with my mother, brother and grandfather.  Honestly we describe it as WOW overall.  First and most important of why this is place is WOW is because of the staff, how friendly and helpful they were.  Fidal from housekeeping deserves commendation for not only cleaning our rooms so proficiently and attentively, he had such positive energy while doing it!  Patricia from Customer Services, was a true god send to us, she guided us on where to go, supported the needs of my elderly Grandfather like he was her own and helped with anything we needed.

"This is the fourth time we have stayed at Berjaya Times Square, having always been happy with it before.  This time, things are very different.  We booked and paid for this in mid November but on checking in yesterday at about 6pm, we were told we would have a room with two single beds pushed together because all the double rooms were booked. (Hello? Yes? Booked by us, six weeks earlier.).  We were also put in the east tower, which is apparently the serviced apartments.  Anyway, we wouldn’t be bothered complaining if this was the worst of it.  So, here goes ...  The floors have not been cleaned.

Naturally upset yet I still accommodated to wait. I was given a “welcome drink” to redeem and wait on the 14th floor which only serve to fuel my current state of unhappiness even more.   Reason given that the room was not ready was the typical “this is peak season”. That’s not a good reason. It is an excuse.   Given the “reason” of peak season, all the more as a hotel there is an expectation",1,-0.3412
Got upgraded to Premier. Sleep facing KLCC tower if you get view facing twin tower. Definitely worth the it! Room was clean and well upkeep.

The same experienced encounter for my second stay at berjaya . The only good thing is fast check in and check out just because i check in late at night and check out early in the morning . For me the only good thind is the location close to monorail imbi station that connect me to kl sentral then to the airport . Even the television channel is limited with not clear picture huhu. ,2,0.4051
We are staying here for a short family getaway from Christmas and new year. Overall I’d say the hotel is quite run down. Our 2 bedroom deluxe room is anything but that unfortunately - it is well overdue for a remodel. The beds are like sleeping on a plank of wood and the bathrooms are quite terrible.  The buffet breakfast has a lot of food but it really caters for the Indian/asian clientele with a large range of curries etc which I don’t really eat at breakfast. The food often runs out and it can take a while before it is replenished.  The location of the hotel is great with the mall right below it. The swimming pool is ok but it is very cold and the seating is very limited around the pool.  Overall we have been a bit disappointed and wouldn’t stay here again ,3,-0.0719

The stay at the Premier Club Room was great. The room was spacious and the bed was huge. The hotel may not be the newest but what stands out is the exceptional service that we enjoyed as premier club guests.

We booked the service suite under Berjaya Times Square hotel. It is located on the East while the hotel is located in the West. We were looking forward to the stay but was disappointed. Following are reasons: 1) There is no complimentary parking for hotel guests. You need to pay for every entry. 2) There is no microwave in the service suite. It only has a mini EMPTY fridge with complimentary coffee and tea without creamer.  3) The aircon took about half an hour to cool the place down. Is it due to the poor configuration of the room or the lack of maintenance of the system? 4) The water heater is not working.  5) We were give 2 double beds together and that is their queen size bed? 6) The service suite booking does not come with breakfast so I can't comment.

Location wise is superb, easy access for shoping and dining due to its location in the shopping mall. My other disappointment was in-house guest had to pay parking fee rm10.",4,0.9091
"I must have been really unlucky thinking this hotel's location is good and 5 stars too.  Wait at the lobby was terrible, check in system really slow and lengthy  Room dirty like it hasn't been cleared for 4 months. Equipment spoilt, room deco dated!",1,-0.2705
"I booked the studio room but was shocked to see how the room was being managed in terms of the cleanliness and the condition of the items in the room. Lucky your manager Izah upgraded us to better room.  Before that we had to view three other rooms which was either dirty or stinky. Please do something about the studio rooms in your hotel.  Also to try to ensure no lizard in the toilet also. Disgusting.  I can only compliment on the excellent spread of breakfast, good dining menu and the location of the hotel which is beside the shopping centre. ",3,0.8885
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the staff especially to the Manager In charge (Sabrina) whom extend her dedication on her role for allowing us to have a late check out as I had a bad stomach upset and requested an hour late checkout. I was given a complimentary 2 hours late check out instead due to my condition which I didn’t expected that. Thank you so much my dear (Sabrina) for your kind gesture. Would definitely come back to the hotel for my next business trip.,4,0.9452

Check is was quick n easy and special thanks to the lady manager who gave us 2 good rooms with absolutely stunning view of the city and she was good to talk to and very Frindly with guest  As a club premier room guest we have access to all day tea coffee refreshment at the lounge complimentary and snacks n drinks from 5:30 to 7:30 in evening  We also got fruits n chocolates in our rooms which was a nice gesture and we loved it  Breakfast was good and nice variety for Indian travellers . It’s a hotel with mall itself and have everything so don’t require any taxi to go for shopping or eating food outside you just,5,0.9863
"I stayed at the Berjaya Times Square hotel for 8 nights &amp; loved it! Check in was swift &amp; easy. Check out was a little slower as there was a small misunderstanding about my late check out. My room was incredibly spacious, the furnishings were modern &amp; the bed was super comfortable.  Housekeeping was marvellous! My room was kept spotless the entire time. As a solo female  traveller, I felt completely safe. There is no access to the floors, rooms or pool area without a key card. There are 6 lifts in operation so you never have to wait long. WiFi was fast &amp; worked perfectly.   As of the hotel restaurants is under renovation so breakfast is served  in an enormous area. There are a wide variety of choices available at the breakfast buffet. There’s an Indian selection, an egg station,",5,0.9627

Arriving at 3pm we were given only one room and told because I requested rooms close to each other one wasn’t ready and wouldn’t be for an hour. We went upstairs to the bar to have a snack and 90 minutes later still no room but my mother in law and her sister were given a rest room to wait. It was disgusting, the whole floor smelt of smoke and then they were told the room would not be ready till at least 8pm as the hotel was 95% booked out that was the best they could do.  At 9pm when we came back from a walk around the shops we were told they were going to upgrade us all to a two bedroom suite we could all move to. So at 9:30pm after my",2,0.7876
Great location in the middle of a huge shopping centre which is open from 10am to 10pm.  Lots of great bargains to be had as well as plenty of restaurants and massage facilities.  Rooms are big and apartment style.  They are a little dated but really only there for sleeping.  Good aircon.  Pool area is very nice and breakfast was a bit average and quite expensive at 20RM each plus tax.  Overall would definately stay again particularly for the location,4,0.9359
"Overall staying at Berjaya Times Square Hotel was a wonderful experience, with special thanks to Ms Kusma Kastari who gave professionalism a personalised touch to make sure I had a nice and comfortable room to stay along with the meeting room prepared well in advance. I think more than the hotel what matters are the hotel representatives managing the events and relationships, in this regard I would mention Kusma Kastari as being extremely professional, dedicated, giving attention to detail and also dropping by on public holidays to make sure that the event is managed as per organiser’s expectations. Moreover, Kusma’s constant attention to gathering regular feedback and making necessary changes accordingly is greatly appreciated. I think it’s not about the hotel it’s more about",4,0.9864

A hotel with a great position on Imbi beside Bukit Bintang. A 5 minute walk to the main tourist areas. Direct access to Times Square shopping plaza. Great pool area. Adequate breakfast. Sho around on Trivargo as there are better deals to be had. Not expensive for what you get. Is in need of modernisation to command higher prices but a lot going for it at the price.,4,0.7579

The room is super big for three people. It’s clean and quiet. The view is great from our floor. Although the room is obviously old but it’s clean and spacious. Entertainment was a bit limited since we only have a tiny tv set for such a big room.  The mall below the hotel is great because we don’t need to look for a place to eat and buy stuff - very convenient for tourists.,5,0.9545

The check in took more than 30 minutes, just very slow typing and checking and checking. Communication from a male staff was unclear and soft. He had to ask from a more senior staff twice when I asked for connecting rooms (I booked 2 rooms). Eventually asked to come back at 3pm since room was not ready at 1.30pm.

We stayed in berjaya Times Square Kuala Lumpur in the month of August. The view from our topmost room was breathtaking. It is ideally situated close to a shopping mall which makes getting necessities early although it closes by 10 pm. The long walks to the restaurant was tiring with parents who are senior citizens. The breakfast buffet didn’t meet expectations. The conceirage staff was very friendly but housekeeping arrogant ,3,-0.0396

"The Berjaya Times Square Hotel is very central to a fantastic shopping mall.  The hardest thing to do is to find the hotel in the first place.  There were no directions as to how to get to the hotel from the monorail or shopping centre.  When you get there they want a very large deposit which we only paid a part of, the room was not made up for us with no toiletries, towels, some lights didn't work and only one bedside light.  When all of that was corrected every day we needed to call down for something or other to be corrected.  Also the hallway to the lift smelt like an ashtray.",3,0.5046

The location of Berjaya Times Square Hotel is really good and close to everything. The transit system ie trains and monorail are great. The biggest problem with the hotel is cleanliness there is pretty well none or very basic and it's such a shame because it wouldn't take a lot to make the place shine again.
