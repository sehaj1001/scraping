"The Blue Bar on the 51st floor was AMAZING. From the moment you step from the elevator to the ouside bar area, you cant stop saying WOW! Million dollar views of the Petronas Towers and city, sleek bar, mood lighting and relaxed furniture and great staff. My friend and i visited mid-week so it was not crowded and the staff were so friendly, encouraging us to take photos with there help if needed. A shout out to Meng and her male collegue (who worked in Bangkok, Hard Rock Cafe group) who both had excellent english and hospitality skills. Don't ""land"" anywhere else, come to the Blue Bar. you won't be dissappointed.",5,0.9806
"This is a fantastic hotel for so many reasons. It was so good that we extended our vacation in KL just to stay at the hotel for the second time a few days after checking out. First location is excellent. Both Pavillion and KLCC are within 10 minutes walking distance. The view of KL especially from higher floors was beautiful!  99% of the staff are super friendly and they go out of their way to please guests. For example getting late check out was no hassle at all. The receptionist agreed without making you feel “we are doing you a favor”. I accidentally left my Apple Watch after checking out. I called 2 days later, the watch was kept safely and returned to me immediately after we checked in the 2nd time. Didn't even need to remind the staff. They just knew.   Food especially the",5,0.9784
"Our vacation to KL began when were welcomed by EQ hotel representatives at the airport and whisked into a luxury car for a comfortable one hour journey to the hotel.   When we are arrived at the hotel the warm welcome we received from the hotel staff made us feel truly special.     The check-in was conducted in our room after a short tour of our impressive room. The only hiccup being that the card machine wasn't working, but this was a minor blemish on a great introduction to the hotel.  We stayed in a Premier King which was a very modern room with fantastic panoramic views of Kuala Lumpur.   On our first night we enjoyed cocktails and drinks in Blue.  The bar is the perfect place to enjoy the jaw dropping views of KL and the Petronas Twin Towers.  Once dark, the city comes",5,0.9887
"I can't stress how much I love staying in this hotel. Been to a couple renowned hotel brands but nothing beats the service they provided over here. From the moment you stepped your foot into the hotel until the moment you checked out, the staffs never failed to produce service with excellency. Special thanks to the team, Mr Irwan, Ain, Hamidah, Mr Kumar, Shahir, Zainal and everyone else for making my business stay feels like vacation. Also, sending much love to Lenu, Fiezam, Masami and Petricia for accommodating my requests.  Ps: the hotel is so thoughtful into sending small details such as chocolates and providing hand sanitizer everywhere even in the room!",5,0.9896
"Had a fantastic stay at premier Room. I was so surprise with the marriage proposal my partner had arranged  and Ms Aslina had helped him to coordinate the room. Room decoration is exquisite &amp;  the view was  magnificent.  My fiance' and I went to Blue Bar, a rooftop bar with great panoramic view of KLCC &amp; Kl Tower. Mr Bakthiar helped us to get a perfect seat and provided us with a excellent service.  EQ is a great place to stay and I would definitely come here again  ",5,0.9827
Great service at the club lounge. Wonderful view of the Petrona twin towers. Thank you Affizzam for taking good care of me and making me the best Mojito. You passed with flying colors. Will definitely be back again to EQ,5,0.9729

"The staff at Equator Club Lounge are amazing!!!!! They make you feel at home and are very kind. Immediately upon arrival I was greeted by Ryan, Aslina and Asni. They went above and beyond. I am celebrating my honeymoon and they made it extra special. Words can't express how special they made it, especially during a time when the world is experience a pandemic. I can't thank them enough!!!!! I am very humbled and thankful!!!!! If you have not stayed at this hotel, then you are missing out on hospitality, luxury and beauty!!!!!",5,0.9465
"Was in KL for my best mate's wedding; and stayed for a few nights... and what an experience it was. The best city stay I've had. Right from the room, the service, the Gym, Spa experience, the pool.... then the club lounge, even started the stag-do at the Sky Bar and it was epic.... and the Staff is quality, specially Mani! It was pure aces...",5,0.8655
"On the last 24 Febuary , Me and My Fiancee has visited to the Equatorial Sky 51 Blue Bars as a walked in Guest, I would say the bar concept and creation is amazing! The Duo Liveband  where they're singing is really bringing a relaxtion vibes where we're quite enjoyed it, and the services is awesome especially the bartender Mr.Joel, a tall guy with a good cantonese speaking and he's really friendly guy, The drinks that he recommend (Blue Moon and Purple Rain) Cocktails is simply delicious and worth paid! Other then that, The view of Twins Towers KLCC in the level 52 is no words can describe, it's Beautifull and Perfect ! Thanks Joel and Blue Bar Sky51, You Really Rock our Night! WIll we Came here again in the nearest future? For sure we will !",5,0.9882
"This review is for Blue @ Sky 51.   I proposed to my girlfriend today at this place. I imagined a simple and discrete proposal, as we are both kinda private person.  The place, and it's lovely team exceeded my expectations. They went out of their way to accommodate my proposal and added few touch of details to make the proposal extra special.  Rooftop view is the best in KL. Drinks were great. And the complimentary chocolate further exemplify the team's exceptional hospitality.   Thank you very much to Miguel, Siva and the team for making this day special, not to mention at such short notice (I planned it just 2 days prior).",5,0.9716
"First time at EQ KL after reopening of the new brand. Stunning with the interior deco....The room is so cosy, modern and the ambience is just like home. The club floor is spacious with  many seating area. Swimming is cool, fitness centre at 29th floor are just so comfortable with state-of-the-art equipment. The food over breakfast are just excellent. Healthy and fresh foods served. Worth spending.",5,0.9696
"As a family of four (2+2) we spent 3 nights at EQ in KL. From the moment we stepped into the lobby the service was absolutely friendly, professional. The facilities (pool, gym, spa) are top notch and the Nipah restaurant buffet (tried for breakfast, lunch and dinner) was one of the best culinary experience in any hotel we ever had. Location of the hotel is very convenient, walking distance to Petronas towers and the main malls. Just the hotel itself makes me want to come back to KL soon again.",5,0.8718
"Fine dining is really hard to find in KL, but Sabayon is getting there! The food was good, but the staff and the ambiance is even better. We felt very welcome and well trained staff is also very rare in KL, my compliments!! Absolutely worth going! Will definitely come again!!",5,0.9804
"This review is for Sky 51 at EQ. As an Expat in KL, we do rooftop bar hopping and we think Sky 51 has one of the best view of the Petronas towers. The drinks list is good with quite a good list of single malt selection. Service wise need to be improve. We waited for so long to get some attention from the staff. We only get attention toward the end of the nights since most of the table had already left. ",4,0.9432
"We, a family with two children, had booked a suite but were given the opportunity to get two fantastic rooms high up overlooking the Twin towers. The breakfast was really good and the staff very nice. The gym and pool area enhanced the experience of the stay. The gym has a good selection of machines. The pool on the 29th floor was soothing. However, the staff at Skybar has some development potential. We will probably be back next year.",5,0.9783
"This hotel is the new successor to a local Kuala Lumpur hotel called The Equatorial Hotel, known for its quality as a businessman's hotel for decades and which was closed a few years back for reconstruction. Its decor now is contemporary with modern top quality finish and facilities. It has a French cuisine restaurant called Sabayon on the 51st floor, which also has a bar with excellent view of the city landscape. The coffee house, Nipah, is located at the ground level and serves a wide spread of local and Western food for buffet breakfast. It has an outdoor pool on the 29th floor together with a spa as well as a gymn. There is also space for Yoga lessons. The hotel and restaurant staff are all courteous, friendly and ever ready to help. We booked a Premium King room which was",5,0.9595

"We enjoyed stay here 3 days during our business trip. The room was clean and nice. The food was also good menus, Nippah was good. Pool is fantastic view. overall hotel was excellent and meet my expectations. We would recommend this hotel to friends and come back next time.",5,0.9788
"The design of this new hotel stands out in KLs skyline as well as the way it is run inside. Amazing pool, amazing gym amazing restaurants (especially Kampachi). Rooms are a great size and the bathrooms well thought out - for one, separate toilet! Much as I love my partner, this is genius! 😀 Loved the accessories provided in the bathroom too. Views from the top are breathtaking. Try the old fashioned cocktail made with palm sugar. Still dreaming of our stay at EQ.  Also want to say the location of this hotel is excellent. Walking distance to shopping at the Pavillion. ",5,0.9892
"Attracted EQ 2 alphabet while I was enjoying ourselves in a chain Hotel Club lounge, not knowing that is hotel hidden in this place till I received information of upcoming event in this hotel.  Since is pre Valentine, decided to bring my love one to spend a staycation in EQ hotel. Was greeted warmly by the bell ball upon arrival and everyone greeted you as if you have arrived back to your “Home”. The crew was so attentive and their hospitality was great ....  Room was nice, cosy, comfortable and with a view of Twin Tower. Location of this hotel is ideal as they situated in between of prime areas such as KLCC shopping mall, Pavilion, Twin Tower and Bukit Bintang ... within a walking distance of 10 minutes to be exact. Besides that, this hotel is surrounded by Marts in case one",5,0.9833
"I would like to kickoff this review by giving a shoutout to Sebastian Lochbrunner (Assistant Manager, Rooms Dividion of EQ Hotel). He is truly the MAN!  And the following would explain why &amp; how, in my most sincere &amp; truthful opinion ever. To begin with, Mr. Sebastian and I have been in communication for almost a month plus leading up to my fiance's birthday on the 11th Feb 2020.   I have never done something like this before, but I was determined to do it this once to make it memorable for her and Mr. Sebastian promised it will be. It truly was.  First of all, a good ""birthday surprise"" required some planning &amp; strategising and Sebastian was very accommodating with it.  On the evening of 11th Feb 2020, I ushered my fiance blindfolded (because it was a surprise) to room 4806",5,0.9758
"We ended our 2 week Malaysian vacation with 2 nights in a club room at the EQ and we couldn't have picked a better place to stay. The room was excellent &amp; the cocktail hour in the club lounge was well worth the upgrade. We were totally blown away by the rooftop bar though and our final dinner in The Sabayon restaurant was exquisite. If you are thinking of a hotel to stay in in KL, this should be at the top of your list. ",5,0.7264
Loved this hotel. Rooms are spacious with amazing views and everything you need. Free mini bar with soft drinks. Pool was amazing and nice area to sit. Not at all busy when we were there. Staff were all very friendly and helpful. They seemed to genuinely care what you thought about the food etc. Had the amazing buffet at Nippah restaurant one evening with oysters prawns etc and a huge variety of other foods. There are lots of other restaurants within easy walking distance. (We liked Malai Thai). Breakfasts were great. Lots of choice. Handy location for tourist visit. You can walk to shops at Bukit Bintang and to the Twin Towers. You can also jump on the monorail at Raja Chulan just by the hotel to get to KL Sentral for trains to Batu Caves. ,5,0.9919
"We stayed for 3 days 2 nights during CNY. The room was well kept with amazing KLCC view. We had a pleasure watching lion dance at the lobby.   We planned to have lunch at Nipah but when we went there the staff said it was fully booked. We walked away but she quickly catch us to confirm if we were hotel guests. Upon been informed, she made a quick action by informing us that she will checked on the reservation and update by 1.30 pm. The staff called us before 1 pm to inform availability. The buffet was not much varieties but everything tasted excellent especially fish curry and grill lamb.  The vitality pool surely help to release my stress. The infinity pool was spacious to accomodate the guests.  Overall the hotel service was excellent with proactive housekeeping to restaurant",5,0.9794
"I was stayed for 3 day and 2 night at EQ, location and food was good, i stayed there with my family members, my second day stayed there i was surprised have housekeeping lady (Nasrin) i couldn't remember how to spelling her name, she bell my room for courtesy check after her colleague cleaned our room, she asked about room cleanliness, she is very friendly and attentive, this is a excellent service i get it from her, this is my first impression with room cleaning service, Overall, the value for money was well worth what you get. i would recommend this hotel to anyone. i will come back again too...",5,0.9694
Amazing hotel! With amazing service. Thank you to Manimmaran for the amazing hospitality. Super big and cozy rooms! executive lounge access with amazing service. A few nice restaurants! Sky 51 is a beautiful rooftop bar with amazing KLCC view! ,5,0.9875
"The service by the staff here is excellent ! Also, waking up to a view of KLCC from my room is breathtaking. The hotel has an amazing cocktail bar at level 51 ! A lot of assistance was provided by Mr. Manimaran and Mr. Syakeel to ensure that my stay with my family was comfortable.",5,0.9515
Just had a wonderful 2 night stay here with my mum during the Chinese New Year long weekend. I was extremely impressed with the hotel from the moment I arrived at the hotel's car park when the security guard on duty voluntarily stepped forward to assist me in transferring my mum from the car to her wheelchair. This type of service is almost impossible to find in KL. The high level of service continued throughout my stay with practically every member of staff I met smiling and greeting me. The room was large and spacious and the bed extremely comfortable. The food in EQ is also of a high quality and the buffet in Nipah is well worth the price. The swimming pool is gorgeous and it is so relaxing just to sit and enjoy the evening breeze by the pool. The only fault I can find is,5,0.9839
Waking up with KLCC view is just so amazingly beautiful and cocktail at night at Sky51 bar with KL skyline ! My whole family enjoyed our staycation at EQ. Good service &amp; free minibar snacks ! Will definitely come back again and recommend to friends.,5,0.9714

The room was big and it's all there everything you need , like the view of Petronas are just in front of us ,lots of complimentary even the drinks in the mini bar too. The infinity pool was amazing.

"Recently opened property. Nice rooms, fantastic staff led by a great GM.  EQ rooftop bar is the best place to have a drink and enjoy panoramic view of downtown Kuala Lumpur.  Nippah restaurant is great for weekend brunch - fresh oysters are amazing.  Kamapachi is also a great option for Japanese. ",5,0.9864
Recently attended business meeting in EQ hotel and stayed there for 3 nights. The hotel is very new and the staffs are very courteous and friendly. The location is very strategic. The city view at 51 floor is amazing where you can see both KLCC and KL tower.,5,0.8969

Hotel has every facility for any taste: gym with a view, infinity pool, jacuzzi, sauna, steam bath, spa and all. All personnel are very friendly and pays attention to your every need, they are just trying make your stay memorable and comfortable. Loved the experience and will definitely stay here again during my next trip.",5,0.9783
"Our family used to stay at the Equatorial prior to its redevelopment. Boy, were we happy to hear that EQ had arrived in town. Service here is wonderful! We have experienced many hotels in KL and we really have to say that this one truly has heart for its guests. Be sure to buy Club access and check out the rooftop bar! Highly recommended :)",5,0.9556
"Overall excellent experience on my trip from 6 - 7 Jan 2020. My room was well furnished and I had enjoy my stay in a tech-savvy, contemporary fashioned yet cozy room designed with the business-traveller in mind.  All staffs at reception was always courteous and helpful. F&amp;B staffs was excellent in breakfast time at Nipah Restaurant. The Japanese Restaurant is Kampachi served Udon seafood was good and staff provided prompt service.  The infinity pool has some 'wow' factor with great views from the 29 floor and there is a good gym open 24 hours.",5,0.9812
"Me and my family had a great 2020! Truly Malaysian hospitality.  Despite some hiccups during check in, I'm impress that Mr Robert addressed our concern immediately in a professional manner, together with his superior management team. I cannot remember all of their names, but with some memorable like Ms Aslina and her staffs at club lounge, the newbie Xerm tried her best too. Plus Afiq from concierge ran a few times for my mom's fax documents, much appreciated!  They pull out their best, for their first new year at this new reopening hotel. They finally relieved when 2020 kicks in, their cheers at the back of the lounge is unforgettable :)  In my opinion the interior design, details of the room is a so-so, I was expecting like a Conrad or St Regis standard. However it compensated",5,0.9925
"As Family, spending 9 Nights at the EQ Hotel in Kuala Lumpur has made our stay very memorable. We have been very happy with the staffs, the welcome, especially they cared and cater for all of our needs. The food was excellent from the Kampachi to Nipah restaurant as well as the Sky Bar! Not to forget the spa, the infinity pool where you get to listen to music under water was a fabulous experience for the kids. The cleanliness is not be questioned. It was very close to the shopping malls and the metro station as well. We would like to go back to the hotel when in KL and would even recommend the hotel. The staffs was very lovely and welcoming and they would do anything to assist you in anyway they can. They even went out of their way to get energy booster for my child who was",5,0.9882
"We booked this hotel with room that have view of KLCC to watch the fireworks and celebrate New Year 2020. One day before I arrive at the hotel, I called them to informed that I will need wheelchair and the lady in the phone assured me that it has been reserved and ready when I arrive. I just have gout removal surgery on both of my feet that week.  When I arrived at the hotel lobby I asked for the wheelchair which I already told them. After waited around 30 minutes I started to get in patience. None of the staff inform me what's happening until I asked then again then they told me that all the wheelchair is no more. I was angry and furious because no staff informed me earlier until I have to go and asked again. What if I dont ask maybe I'll be waiting for 1 hour without any news.",5,-0.4364
"Loved everything about this hotel. The room, cleanliness, food, staff, location and general facilities such as WIFI, in-room entertainment, gym, infinity swimming pool, gym etc.   We could get more conveniently located hotels e.g. vis a vis Pavilion mall at about the same price but we opted for EQ since it was brand new.  Raja Chulan station (green line) is 3 mins walk from the hotel, which is convenient if you need to travel long distances by metro to avoid the traffic. Bukit Bintang, Petronas twin towers, jalan alor etc are all within walking distance from the hotel.",4,0.1406
"We had an awesome New Year Eve's celebration in the sky at the EQ.  The Blue rooftop bar was amazing. The staff were fun and as attentive as could be with the crowd. Donny Ray Evins was such a treat to hear! What a performer!  DJ Niza kept us dancing till 3:30! With the view of KL skyline and the fireworks display, all created a celebration we won't forget! Thank you EQ for an incredible celebration!",5,0.9487

"My Family and I visited Malaysia between 29th December 2019 and 1st January 2020. We chose EQ based on the rating on Tripadvisor which was #1 at the time. This was the best decision we could have made. The staff are extremely polite, friendly and attentive. Every single staff member greets and helps from the minute we stepped out of the car, too being taken to reception, then being shown around our room. Even during our stay every person would greet when passing by. The service is something I imagine from a luxury chain such as the Four Seasons  The breakfast spread is extensive, with a station for pastries and pancakes, fresh juices, Japanese noodles, egg station, cheeses and cold meats and another with warm items like traditional Malaysian, Asian and Indian dishes.

"Booked a room though booking.com for a 2D/1N stay in conjunction with the New Year Eve and Hubby's B'day celebration. Few weeks before my arrival, the hotel reached out to me twice to ask if there's anything that they could assist us and if there's anything that we need. I also followed and added them in Instagram and instantly I received a private message from the Marketing Team and I was really impressed with their top notch customer service. Really have to commend them on that.  On the day arrival, things were smooth although we have to wait a while for the check in as it was a full house due to the peak season. We were brought up to the Club at Level 50 for the check in and it was really thoughtful of them. Staff were friendly, courteous and efficient and we never felt so",5,0.9636
Excellent place to celebrate Christmas.  The ambiance is so festive and well coming. Food is so fresh and well laid out of different choices. The most important dish for us is a wee roasted turkey with good moisture. We will come back to celebrate Xmas again with family.,5,0.9792
"We were warmly greeted when we first entered the lobby. Due to NY eve check-in, the check-in took longer and there was bottleneck at one particular queue. After raising concern, we received notice in extending our check-out time to 4pm the next day. Quite a surprised! The entire stay was pleasant. The staff were all very friendly and welcoming. Salt sauna and monsoon shower experience were great. Love this place and will definitely go again and even for just a weekend breakaway.",5,0.9805

Room is nice but my room 3111 facing a residential flat almost equally tall which just 30m away, so close that I hardly wind up the curtain for a skyline view. ( Tips: ask for high floor ). and the water tap for both basin is supply only HOT water. The aircon works very well. Bed is excellent. Plenty of lights and switches to control.  The reception area is small with only a few seats there for a 5 star Hotel. I tried high tea in the lobby lounge, the service is poor only 1 staff there. And she cannot express to us the details of the high tea menu. She has no patience and always not around for service. The food is not nice and pricely. I tried Breakfast as well. Service is normal.

"Stayed across Christmas period and enjoyed the most relaxing experience. The staff are attentive and always on hand to assist and provide during your stay. The hotel is tastefully decorated and exudes a sense of calm and tranquility. The infinity pool, gym and spa all add to the relaxation whilst the restaurant s and bars provide a superb cross section of world cuisine.

"We stayed 3 nights at EQ and the rooms and service were amazing. This is a big shout out to Radhika and David from the reservations team who attended to my reservation requests and allowed my family and I to feel really at home.  Everyone enjoyed the hotel, its facilities  and its amenities as well. The location is also great to get to 2 well known shopping malls Suria KLCC as well as the Pavillion. Although it rained on one of those days a hot shower to clean and dry one self is really satisfying.   At breakfast Has and Hamizzul and all the service staff including the chefs really made us feel welcomed and comfortable. We loved the service and fresh juices.

"Stayed for a couple of nights in the Premier King room. We were given the corner room (xx16) on a high floor facing the KLCC on one side and the KL Tower on the other. Views were amazing from that height. It's the same view you would get from the top floor bar, but in this case from the comfort of your room.  Everything about the room is nice - very well laid out, super comfortable bed, bathtub with a view, coffee machine, luxury toiletries, etc. The hot water does take a bit of time to come on in the showers, though.  It's more of a couple's hotel, but you do get the odd family here and there. Service is attentive and warm. The staff always seem to be there when we need them, and nowhere to be found when you want peace and quiet. I don't think it's easy to achieve that kind of",5,0.9779

The hotel has everything with top service from all their staff. The bar at Sky51 is my favourite place now for the best view of the KL sky line. The rooms are spacious with lovely modern interior that is cosy and comfy at the same. The food is always my go to at EQ and the buffet spread at Nipah is amazing! Enjoyed my relaxing spa sessions and fully equipped gym. Love the pool views too! Happy I could get all this luxury treatment here and definitely looking forward to being back in EQ KL soon! 🤩,5,0.9859

Amazing staff who will do everything to make you feel at home in this hotel. The room is spacious and have everything you need! Thanks for the room with view  on the Petronas on the 43rd floor. Breakfast is good and has a lot of variety. The only negative point was the pressure of the shower but it didn't really impact my stay!  Could come again for suuuure!,5,0.4983
"Had the chance to stay at EQ for 4 nights - and during this short stay, the experience was IMPECCABLE - I have stayed at other 5+ star hotels before in KL, yet none would come any closer to the personalised greetings, attentive service and the care for guests that is afforded by the EQ staff right the moment you step into the hotel, until you leave! Radhika, Haz and the rest of the team really went all out to service their guests and made sure that we are comfortable with our stay. As we were celebrating my wife's birthday and our wedding anniversary, the team even made it more special with balloons and a sumptuous cake compliments of EQ. The rooms are new and spacious, and the hotel also provides a complimentary mini bar with soft drinks, and also lots and lots of bottled",5,0.975
"The EQ (as it is now known, formerly The Equatorial) has not lost it's friendly authentic charm. Genuine concern for it's patrons' enjoyment and comfort continue to be evident. Despite having acquired considerably more glitz and glam (not to mention height and size) with its reopening, dIning at the hotel's (beautifully lit) banquet rooms continues to be a wholesome treat.

"Had a lovely evening at EQ's rooftop bar, Sky51. Good cocktails, especially the smoked negroni. Good service and it has a wonderful view of KL, including direct views of the KLCC and KL Tower. Will definitely recommend as a must-visit when in KL.",5,0.9552

"From a small 4 star 16 story hotel from the early 70's to now a gigantic 51 story 5 star hotel, EQ has come a long way. Its a beautiful hotel with all the 5 star over the top F and B in Kuala Lumpur eateries. Make sure you visit the 51st floor bar and Resturant the view is amazing and its a must when visiting KL. The rooms are fantastic and the price is on par with most 5 star hotels. I highly recommend ""The EQ""  ",5,0.9531
The latest luxurious icon gracing KL's skyline has a team of remarkably helpful and friendly staff exemplifying Malaysian hospitality. A motivated and smiling basement security guard isn't something one sees everyday.  And what a lovely Christmas tree !!!,5,0.968
"The hotel is very well located and features very High standards. It is well decorated and the room are wide, modern and elegant. Unfortunately I found the service not as top as such an hotel should offer",4,0.5986

"Fantastic venue with good location at the centre of Kuala Lumpur hub, walking distance to KLCC &amp; Pavilion. Accessible to the Monorail. Lots of good restaurants next to the hotel and more choices all waiting walking distance.  The hotel is practically still ‘brand new' our coffee machine still have sticker tape on the lid (un-open)! The room is sparkling clean (obviously) &amp; the bed is absolutely “heavenly” to get a good night sleep.   The cafe where we had our lunch during our hectic schedule offers the best selection of food for a very decent price - a must try! The oysters are freshly shelled to order! And the Sashimi....as fresh as you can get them!   Overall a great 1st time experience - we are planning to have more events there!!!",5,0.9817
"A couple of times, I been staying at EQ Kuala Lumpur and it always has been great but it keeps still getting better each time I stay. This time, I have met Sebastian Lochbrunner, a great host, we had a good chat and as I wanted to enjoy some Lebanese food, he even walked with me out of the hotel to show me probably the best Lebanese restaurant in town. Food in the hotel was also great, they had a superb Greek food promotion and the club lounge was intimate and felt like my personal living room.",5,0.9925
I stayed one night at EQ hotel. This is a stunning hotel. Check in and check out were handled efficiently. Wifi is free throughout the hotel. The deluxe king room is spacious and comfortable. The soft drinks in the fridge are free. Staff are very attentive and helpful. The breakfast buffet is excellent offering a variety of cuisines. ,5,0.9681
"Location and service of this hotel is fantastic. 5 mins walk to KLCC or Pavillion Mall. Staff were very friendly. Breakfast spread is amazing. You are taken to your seat, asked how you want your eggs and they send it over to your table. No need to stand in queue. It is a good buffet spread and on the spot they make the likes of waffles, roti canai and send to your table. Their roof top bar has amazing view of Twin Towers and KL Tower. Swimming pool with music underwater, and view of KL tower.. This hotel is a real gem in KL. ",5,0.9652

"This stunning EQ hotel has been recently opened in March 2019. Everything is brand new, stylish and high quality. Lots of details and luxury, which helps you relax and enjoy your holiday in Kuala Lumpur.  Our studio suite club room was on 49th floor with a fantastic view over the whole city and twin tower. You have complimentary access to the club lounge on 50th floor, which offers free breakfast, tea and evening snacks incl. coffee, softdrinks, wine and beer.  particularly EQ Club manager Asline Semsudin was a daily contact person, who personally took care of every need with great ambition.

"From the moment we arrived at this beautiful hotel we were made to like valued guests! We were escorted to the Equator Club by Aslina, the Equator Club Manager and offered a glass of wine whilst we checked in, Aslina then took us to our room on the 49th floor and my husband and I were amazed and delighted to have a view from our room of the Petronas Towers right in front of us!  The room was just luxurious,  as was the entire hotel! All of the food that we tried during afternoon tea, cocktail hour and breakfast was outstanding. We went to the bar on the 51st floor which had spectacular views!  We were very well looked after by Dinas. The pool area was lovely and the infinity pool was so refreshing after sight seeing! The spa facilities were much welcomed too! We would have no",5,0.9819

My wife is touched with the arrangement and special thanks to Nasreen who helped us to decorated and attended us with open hand!,5,0.943
"Clearly a lot of thought, time and money was used for the tasteful renovation.   Service is to be commended.  If you are travelling to KL staying here is an absolute no brainer.  Gym and spa are well designed as are levels 50 and 51. Congratulations to everybody involved with the hotel.",5,0.8555
"I have not even checked out but I already tempted to write this.  There are just so many Above &amp; Beyond things to say about this hotel; the gym, infinity pool, complimentary minibar, modern room setup, location and many more.  There are 2 things however that I will rate 11/10, that are the To-Die-For Twin Tower view, as I stayed at 43rd Floor and their incredible as well as matchless service. Every single staff I bump into; right from the door, to the reception, hall, lift walkway, restaurant will just greet you with the most courteous smile they can put up. After a tiring day out, such world class service will just give you the best feeling of being home.   This Hotel, EQ Kuala Lumpur, has gotta be the Go-To hotel if you are looking for a world class, good rate and pleasant",5,0.9881
"I recently visited Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur to attend an annual conference at the EQ Hotel.   My six day stay at this phenomenal hotel was absolutely out of this world. The recently renovated EQ hotel offers fantastic rates, amazing service and the staff always goes above &amp; beyond to keep their guests happy.   The facilities in the hotel is five star plus, the only downside to the infinity pool was the construction works across the road, but all was forgotten at the end of the day relaxing at Bar51 with views for days.  I could not fault anything at the EQ during my stay and would HIGHLY recommend the EQ Hotel in KL.  Also a BIG shout-out to Justin the HR Director for the personal tour of Bar51, much appreciated mate!",5,0.9679
"We stayed at Hotel EQ for two weeks and I have to say - superb! This new hotel has luxury guest rooms and fantastic amenities. F&amp;B also very impressive! The people there were so amazing - they address us by names, prompt to assist us, a big thank you to Mr. Sebastian Lochbrunner from the management and chef Andreas for preparing the best New Yorker breakfast Sandwich! I absolutely loved the gym, spa and club lounge (great view^-^) You have to visit the Sanctum Spa if you stay here , I had the best massage ever, the staff were kind, professional and their products were top notch! THANK YOU!!! Congratulations Hotel EQ you are a showcase of genuine hospitality!",5,0.9931
"The spa has a great ambiance. It spells luxury until I noticed the oils labeled in what looks like a cut out craft on a scrapbook. The amenities are gorgeous but I couldn't say the same with the service. The staff are wonderful! Welcoming, happy, respectful and friendly but the massage itself was average. I could have gone to any local massage place and could have a cheaper and better massage. The tea they serve is mediocre, I would have expected a special blend or a signature tea for sanctum spa. Lots of improvement is still needed.",2,0.9913
"Just stayed at the EQ for a conference being held at the same location. Was booked into the club room access level. The room provided was huge with separate sitting room to bedroom with a divided wall, Bathroom was also great The club lounge great, and the staff there are brilliant. They could not do enough, and at the same time always happy and cheerful. The sky bar is also great, but unfortunately limited use use due to rainy season.  Will definately return back to this hotel very soon.",5,0.8126
"We stayed at EQ hotel for almost a week and I cannot wait to go back there!  The whole design of the hotel and the rooms are really beautiful and modern. Everywhere was so clean and smelled nice. The bed was so comfy which is really important in a hotel in my opinion.  The breakfast buffet covered a great variety of food for different tastes and the quality was really good. I really loved the coffee machine in the room with the complimentary capsules. We tried the room service food three times and enjoyed it every time as well.   Another great thing about this hotel is the location. There are several shopping malls, bars, restaurants, and also the KLCC park near the hotel, even within a walking distance.  Last but not least, the very well trained staff add great value to this",5,0.9842

Thanks Sherliza for taking care of me from my arrival til departure. The room she gave me was a corner suite on 42nd floor and the view was breathtaking! You get to enjoy looking at both the twin towers and the KL tower. The view from the bathtub and shower was just amazing. Talking about the view, everybody needs to go and check out the Blue on 51st floor. I used to take my visitors to Banyan tree's Vertigo  but now I know another awesome spot for my guests.

Nice room, pool with underwater music, good gym and therapeutic steam room, sauna. Special thanks to Josephine Tan and Moore and their team at Sanctum Wellness. Maybe should change the not so colourful night lights outside the hotel. Making the building looks cheap at night.",5,0.9744

Nothing is too much trouble.  It's the perfect location within the Golden Triangle, with excellent views of KL from all aspects, a visit to the Blue Bar at night on 52nd floor gives a unique view of the Petronas Towers. There are several dining and drinking options, including Kampachi their famous Japanese restaurant and Bodega for a relaxing drink. Give them a try, you won't be disappointed.",5,0.9535
"EQ is an iconic re-imagination of a Kuala Lumpur landmark which had been home to the city's movers and shakers, as well as generations of visitors who had helped transform the country since the original Equatorial Hotel opened in 1973. Now with 52 instead of 18 storeys, and 21st century versions of favourites like the Japanese restaurant Kampachi and the Blue Moon nightclub (now just Blue, on the 51st floor) guests also enjoy all mod cons from an excellent room-entertainment system to a state-of-the-art gym and sauna, attention to detail is rigorous. This isn't just the best hotel in Malaysia, it's among the best downtown hotels I've stayed in anywhere.",5,0.6771

I stay here 4 nights for business trip in KL. EQ is return. From now until end of the year still soft opening period. I got an upgraded to premiere room which bigger with nice view. Room is quite big and functional. Toiletries were very good in term of quality and variety. Every room has provide daily minibar. There are a sky lounge at 51 floor. Breakfast at Nipah restaurant are very good in service and food quality but still have room to improve. I would say that all of their staffs are ready to provide you an excellent service.

And that says a lot, being the frequent traveler I am.  I would give it 10 stars if I could!  The staff, the facilities, the location, the food, the views...I seriously loved everything about this gorgeous hotel.  Every person on the staff was warm, helpful, kind, friendly, and beautifully dressed (I have to say it!).  They made coming and going from the expansive lobby a JOY!

Then before going to my room, I stayed for the evening cocktail and was seated at a table which they have an incredible view of the twin tower, from then on, I was there every evening during my stay. The room I stayed in also had a 360 degree like view of the city when u recline the auto blinds, the design of the room was modern and with nice quality amenities, the bed was super comfortable.

The owners truly spared no expense and it shows!   I stayed in a Premier King corner room which was very nice. The premier rooms are also ""club"" level rooms, which included a free breakfast, 3 free daily pieces of laundry, and free drinks in the evening. Some hotels the club level isn't worth the extra cost, but here I was impressed by the experience.  The staff were very friendly and attentive.
