A truly good hotel is only as good as its staff. This is particularly true in this case. Every member of staff we encountered made an excellent impression - in particular DiDi and Audrey require a special mention because they (and other staff members in the Executive Lounge - too many to mention) because they made our stay very special and memorable. Thank you. A credit to the Four Seasons. We plan to return!,5,0.9781
"We had a chance to stay overnight at Four Seasons. Location is just right in front of KLCC Mall and walking to Bukit Bintang is just 20 minutes.   Room is spacious with two double beds, good for family stay. It was generally clean, modern, advanced and with huge bathroom and separate shower. As renowned give star hotel, turndown service is a given during evening hours. They will prepare beds, clean the bathroom and restock the bottles of mineral waters.   Breakfast is also excellent with so many choices of Malay food, Western, Indian, and Chinese food.    I would highly recommend staying at this FS with reasonable rates.   ",5,0.9589
"At a time when the hospitality industry has been slowing down considerably because of Covid-19, the Four Seasons Hotel in Kuala Lumpur is still managing to maintain high standards, put the welfare of its guests as its No 1 priority and provide a professional, welcoming service.  We arrived at the hotel lounge just after 7.30pm on a Saturday evening after a full day of travel. We were greeted at the lounge by Swady who helped us to settle in by offering some food and drinks to refresh our energy levels.  Once we were ready to go to our room we were checked in and Swady got everything ready for us.  It was a first class streamlined check-in experience.    On the next morning, we needed to get some medication a nearby pharmacy and Hazrul was kind enough to escort us across the road",5,0.9062
We would specially like to thank Cik Halilah and her team for their excellent customer service and not forgetting Charlotte for giving us a special tour through the Hotel. We were so impressed with the service given to us by Four Seasons Hotel.  The rooms were so clean and the housekeeping was excellent. Executive Lounge the staffs were marvellous. The food was excellent at Execution Lounge and Curate. We would also like to thank the porters and the waiters. We would highly recommend this Hotel.,5,0.9877
We stayed at this lovely hotel for 3 nights early March.  Perfect location right next to Petronas Tower and KLCC park. Rooms are clean and spacious with top-notch amenities. The breakfast buffet serves a wide variety of choices. Special thanks to Jon at the front desk.  He has been very helpful throughout our stay and made our visit very pleasant and memorable.  Highly recommended :),5,0.981
I am really impressed in the service given by the Four Seasons hotel. The room were beautiful and the housekeepers and waiters were very friendly. I've really enjoyed my stay and the connection between staff for remembering my name as I enter the hotel. I appreciate Darshen for handling my luggage and greeting me at the lobby. Rain and Cris were helpful at providing more information about the hotel and the city. Thank you for making my stay meaningful. ,5,0.9785
"I'd like to start this review by thanking Ellie. You helped my husband and I to organize the most beautiful event. We live overseas and although we had annoying time differences and found it hard to find time to talk, Ellie helped us to plan and execute a beautiful event that we will remember for a lifetime.   Ellie, your attention to detail and dedication were very much appreciated!  I have a greater appreciation of event organization after working with you and seeing how many things you can take care of at any given time.  The banquet staff were absolutely lovely and made sure that our guests were well looked after. We had many comments from guests on how wonderful the service was. A credit to both Faiz and Anwar. Thank you again.   As to the banquet menu, woah! We were so",5,0.9893
"I am glad that I choose Four Seasons instead of the others to celebrate our anniversary and my better half birthday. This is our first Four Seasons experience. The service was impeccable even before we reached the hotel.  The Guest Experience Team went above and beyond to make sure the surprise for the Mr. was successful. E-mails and request were replied and taken to consideration. Special shout out to Hazrul Hairee, The Lobby Ambassador &amp; Concierge Team! Thank you for everything!! :) Upon checking in, we were greeted with an amazing team at the lobby and directed us to the reception. We were attended by Sukyee (I might misspelled it!  Sorry!) Checking in was seamless. Service came with a sincere smile. She explains what needs to be explained in detail and wishes us to have a",5,0.9895
"Stayed at the Four Seasons Kuala Lumpur on business for about a week.  Wow, what a hotel!  Staff is unbelievably friendly (several of them called me by my name after a day or two – Cheers!); rooms are enormous; breakfast buffet has a huge selection from Malaysia, Japan, India, and other cuisines, in addition to the usual western breakfast stuff.  Also conveniently located right next to a big and interesting park and a shopping mall with Cold Storage supermarket (selling all kinds of foods, including wines, beers, and spirits) and many restaurants and high-end stores.  The wifi at the hotel worked very well, even for streaming video.  Climate control worked flawlessly and was very quiet.  In fact, despite being in the middle of the city, the room was virtually silent.  I stay in",5,0.9439
"We came to celebrate our mum's 64th birthday (which falls on Feb 29th that will only comes every 4 years) and wanted to do something special for her. To our surprise, the stay had been even more special and memorable than what we expected it to be.   My mum was overwhelmed by all the surprises prepared by the hotel staff.. We really had a great time. Audrey and Jemaima from Club Floor were very welcoming, helpful and nice.   I would definitely recommend it to others.",5,0.9847
"This is a hotel that puts most other 5 stars hotel to shame. I've stayed in many other 5 star hotels but this hotel outclassed all these hotels in every possible way. If there is such a thing, this hotel should be labelled as a six star hotel instead as they are simply a class on their own.   Their service is beyond amazing and you will notice that as soon as you step into the building. I have stayed here many times and always look forward to returning every time. The rooms are fantastic with very high quality fittings installed giving the room a very exclusive and luxurious feel. Breakfast both at the restaurant and at the lounge is great with plenty of options to choose from. The pool and gym is very well maintained with a tonne of equipment to choose from so no waiting in",5,0.9651
"All the staff that i had the pleasure to interact with during my stay there were great service wise towards me as a lone traveler. They were kind...smiling at all times..gave me help when i needed it. No work was done below par out from anyone. From the bellboys, to the check in staff, housekeeping, maintenance, restaurant staff at Curate and not forgetting a kind and concern Hotel Customer Satisfaction Manager by the name of Mr Gurmit Singh. Hope i have the correct job title of his. I had a great stay. The room was far too big for a single occupant but i am not complaining because everything in the room was to my liking. Well except for 1 minor detail that i find is the first of the kind in all the hotels that i have stayed in my travels. And that is the layout of the two",5,0.9124
"It was the first time in FSKL and will not be the last time. Very nice location and view. Clean rooms and very excellent room service staff.   I take the opportunity to thank Mr. Zakaria El Quaroui for the cooperation and his eagerness to meet us and keep direct contact with us to provide the best services to ensure our comfort during the stay.  I also thank Mrs. Samantha Low for the speed of her response to us, and her eagerness to meet us to find out anything that affects our comfort.",5,0.9844
"This is my second time to stay at FSKL and it will not be my last. Here at the end of my 10 day visit I cannot begin to explain the service.  I came for surgery and as it was obvious, the cars the hotel arranged to take me to and from surgery and follow up appointments picked me up and dropped me off in the basement where management met me and brought me to my room so to be discreet.  All their idea and all making a potentially stressful situation into a fun experience.  Not being able to eat much and only being able to eat certain foods room service just made what I wanted.  No question.  Your personal in room tablet allows you to order housekeeping, cotton buds! Towels! Shoe shine! Food!  Transportation!  Literally anything at the push of a button and an online chat available",5,-0.3111
"My wife and I stayed for 2 days in this hotel in a Park View Suite.   Everything from the organisation of airport transportation, check-in and baggage delivery was first class. The staff were all pleasant, friendly and helpful. The room was very comfortable, clean and with a fabulous view of KLCC Park and the Petronas Towers.  We ate dinner in Curate on the first night, which was a lovely experience - the Valentines Day special buffet was excellent and the service couldn't have been better. We had breakfast in the executive lounge the next day and this was once again very good, with great service and an excellent food selection in a peaceful environment.  We had organised a private tour through the hotel for the first day and it was excellent, with a very knowledgeable and",5,0.9929
"We had a wonderful 3 day stay at this hotel! Upon check in we were told that we were upgraded and found ourselves in a wonderful room with goodies waiting for us! The staff is incredible and always seem to go above and beyond. We loved our room and the views. The pool is gorgeous and the restaurant for breakfast was great as well. The location is perfect in the city and has everything you could want or need. If you're coming to Kuala Lumpur, stay here!!",5,0.9812
My gf and I enjoy doing local staycations and the stay at four seasons was arguably one of the best we have had! Firstly the services offered were flawless. The hotel surprised us with a free upgrade from Junior suite to four seasons suite so the suite was very spacious and had everything that we needed. Secondly we had so much of comfort relaxing at the executive lounge on floor 7B. The food and drinks were good. We also had a lot of fun at the pool and jacuzzi. Breakfast was also good. Special mention to Razif and Didi. They took care of each and every guest and were very attentive. Will definitely stay again!,5,0.9894
"We stayed a night here and love the luxury and comfort provided. The room is spacious and elegantly done. Bathroom is lovely with separate bath tub and shower area, well equipped with Loccitane's almond toiletries. There is also a Nespresso coffee maker and comfortable bedroom slippers. The toilet bowl is the automated type. Everything was perfect and we loved our stay.",5,0.9786
"We are currently at the amazing Four Seasons Hotel Kuala Lumpur. This is our first stay at a Four Seasons, but it most suddenly won't be our last! Everything is so comfortable: Very nice staff, great room with amazing view on the park and the Petronas towers, Unbelievable breakfast buffet, the most comfortable bed ever, and beautiful pool area with sauna, steamroom,very nice swimming pool, really everything we could have wished for! Especially nice was our bartender at the poolbar, mister Mugilan Yazir, who made me the best mocktail I have ever had (Pimms Cup ||.

"We arrived in KL after being at the Four  Seasons in Bali (which was great!) We rejected the first suite as it was really for A corporate executive and moved to a one bedroom suite which was lovely.  The hotel is brand new and gorgeous! The finishes -especially in the Spa are stunning! The concierge - Charlotte - was so helpful and could not do enough for Us to ensure our stay was perfect!  We had an interesting 3 Hour tour of the  city.   We were surprised by how modern and built up the city is, but it has retained the charm of earlier days.  The Breakfast Buffet was amazing! So Many choices of foods from everywhere! The entire staff was welcoming and accommodating to our every need!  Highly recommended!  ",5,0.9815
"Before my start my review of this hotel, I must make it clear that my husband and I and my daughter went to 15 different hotel before we decided on Four Seasons Hotel KL.  I must say that I have been to many wedding events in a hotel and the first thing people say about hotel events is that You will need to compromise on the food taste and quality! The service depending on the hotel would vary and many are good. For us, our feedback of Four Seasons Hotel KL is, food was fantabulous, both vegetarian and non vegetarian!  One comment given by a vegetarian family (who are always very honest with their feedback) member was, “ we normally go home hungry after a dinner event at a hotel, but this function, the food was so good and we went hone with a full stomach and a full heart!” This",5,0.8681
I have stayed in many hotels around the world and this hotel by far is the best in terms of service and the staff is so friendly. I want to thank Mr. Zakaria for his service through out our stay I found him outside the hotel with his family and he invited us for coffee at his house. This is hospitality whether inside the hotel or outside. All the best and I will come back. ,5,0.9485
"Very good room, very good service and very cool use of technology. The touch screen toliet was pretty awesome. The iPAD in room was very convenient to contact the front desk or order food. I wish they would let you also use the iPAD for business purposes as well. Breakfast was amazing with a large selection of food and very nice views. The only downside was the shower as it would remain one temperature. It would cycle from burning hot to freezing cold. Both burning me then icing me in a 10-15 second cycle. But overall fantastic hotel, just dont shower, use the tub and bathe.",4,0.9821
"Just finished a great one night stay here and we were thoroughly impressed. We'd originally planned on staying somewhere we earn points, but a good AMEX FHR deal for us to choose this hotel. Boy was that a great idea. They treated us so well, gave us a beautiful room upgrade and lovely massages. They have an excellent breakfast and stunning views of the surroundings, including the iconic Petronas Towers. The staff couldn't be better. We will come back to KL just to stay in this lovely hotel again. ",5,0.9917
The staff are trying their very best to make your stay comfortable and memorable. This trip is for my parents anniversary and the hotel has make many surprise for them. My parents just love it so much and ask for another trip to Malaysia just because of the hotel. ,5,0.9336
"I stayed here this month and had a very enjoyable trip.  I particularly appreciated Zac and his team (and Tvee too) who were very friendly, professional and responsive towards my needs and any challenges I faced.

"We stayed in this hotel for one night. The service from the staff was excellent. Thank you to front officer Intan, Audrey and Razif for the smooth check in. My room was very stunning and we had a very nice view which is in-front of the KLCC park. My kids was so happy and excited.   Thank you to Faridah,Nawal and mastura for escort me and my family to the room. They are very helpful,amazing and friendly. The room was very clean, the bed was really comfy and the room provided high end toiletries.   I called housekeeping to assist my mother for the kiblat sign and Farah housekeeping come to assist us.

"The Four Seasons was opened in a new tower right next to the KLCC shopping mall and the Petronas Twin Towers. As you would expect, the rooms are kitted out to the highest level, with fantastic Japanese toilets. The breakfast is excellent and the staff very good.  By far the best (and most expensive) hotel I've stayed in in KL",5,0.9402
"We stayed in this hotel late last year and was blow. Away by the service and facilities available to guests. Obviously being new everything is in great shape and the staff are extremely efficient and polite.  Only let down for me was the quality of beverages served during evening cocktails. The Four Seasons Brand has always epitomised quality, in my opinion and justified  the premium price paid for such a hotel, so it is baffling as to why they serve such poor evening cocktails. Cheap gin and wines, and  poor quality whisky and vodka and no cognac to be seen. I would expect this kind of selection in a holiday Inn or courtyard certainly not from a premium brand such as four season.  If you offer a luxury product and charge a good price don't insult your guests by serving inferior",4,0.5413

You kind of expect the kind of excellent service from a Four Seasons hotel but at Four Seasons KL, the staff went out of their way to make our stay unforgettable.  By the way, my kids just love the surprise birthday cakes and gifts!    We will definitely be back!  Hasnan Hassan",5,0.9754
"My friend and I were traveling and decided to have a drink in the Lounge. The cocktails were delicious, the service was quick, and the atmosphere was divine. The best part however, was when our server, Elvineh (Vyna), came over with a sample of honey from the infamous stingless bee that the Four Seasons use in their cocktails (having sourced and teamed up with a local farmer to produce that exact honey). She was so knowledgeable, friendly, and delightful and proceeded to give us what felt like a first class experience. We both have worked in the service industry for years and travel consistently so we dine out quite a bit. We were thrilled with our experience.

"I stayed here for 4 nights in a luxurious suite with excellent views. All of the staff are so determined to please, they have a great work ethic and attitude and are always so friendly and happy. In the executive lounge Didi stood out, he remembered our preferences. All of the staff in the lounge are exceptional. The hotel is clean and modern and has a beautiful pool area. The only problem is the food- by the pool the menu seems great but when the food comes, it is of an awful quality, the portions are so small and it generally all tasted bad. The staff also lacked knowledge of the menu. The buffet at Capture was similar too, all of the food lacked flavour and the meats seemed to be tough cuts, fatty, bad quality and cheap! Not a four seasons standard. I always found that we",4,-0.5517
Let me start with wowww !!! When we arrived at four seasons hotel( KL ) We were greated  with smiles and  courtesy. The manager Zack went above and beyond to ensure our stay was  more then amazing which can be stressful with 5 kids at times! There was nothing he didn't do to make our stay one of the most amazing holidays we have had. I've honestly never met a person that goes out of their way to help customers so much!  It was a absolute pleasure staying at four seasons  Kuala Lumpur  We will see you again soon .,5,0.9788

As we stepped in for check in, Ms. Halilah and her team were already waiting for us right in front of the lift of the hotel lobby. We were ushered straight to our suite which has a nice view of the park. Complimentary chocolates, sweets, fruits and 2 bottles of Evian water laid on the table waiting for us. She wanted to make sure that everything were in perfect order. How thoughtful of Ms. Halilah! Btw, if you have kids joining you for your stay, they have kids check in counter too!

"We stayed at the Four Seasons Kuala Lumpur right after they opened, and had an argument the room service staff about a local dish of absolute inferior taste. The chef came up, and the next day he prepared us a nice lunch. So we thought we'd try again, booking lunch at the lounge of the Four Seasons hotel in Kuala Lumpur. It was an absolute disgrace.  The service was lukewarm, with our waitress more interested in doing her admin work than in cleaning away the dishes. The food was even worse than the first time. A simple dish such as a Caesar salad apparently too much to ask: a pathetic affair of just a few old leaves, drenched in something sour, and garnished with anchovies that should have been discarded months ago, giving us the impression the kitchen staff did not even try.

Our pool view room is spacious, modern and clean. I appreciated that there was a long sofa and coffee table which was enough to host my family and friends for board games.

Were this the extent of the review, everything would be great. But the service at breakfast and in the Terrace was lacking. Breakfast looked good, but wasn't. The food was fairly tasteless, and the service was non-existent.

Between the private tours, we killed times shopping at Robinsons and mall.  Rooms were clean, and there's an option to connect the two corner rooms with an external door for large families.

Hotel is next to suria klcc and walking distance to Pavilion.   We complained about a smoking smell in our room and the front desk manager was kind enough to change our room right away. The housekeeping, concierge and all the staff were very friendly and helpful. The Breakfast was great! Plenty of options.  There were only a few negs  1) The smart grohe toilet leaves a lingering pee smell and its not as functional as a toto smart toilet.  2) the corridor hall floor needs to have better scent.   But the staff and service and my overall hotel experience gives it 5/5  Highly likely to come back if I visit KL again",5,0.987
"We were celebrating my husband's birthday and my retirement and it was a real pleasure to stay at the Four Seasons Hotel in KL. Its location in the heart of the city is perfect with a shopping mall within easy walking distance. The room was spacious, complete with good amenities and its cleanliness was superb. The bed and pillows were perfect!   Your breakfast, lunch and dinner buffets are full of delicious dishes and the variety of spread is simply beyond words. We have been having Christmas eve dinner in KL for the last 5 years and have stayed in various 5 stars hotels but, Four Seasons, you're the best ever. You make your guests feel special and important.  You're the only hotel so far that gives a Christmas gift to your guests. This kind of gesture is highly commended. ",5,0.9884
"This is my second visit to this hotel, this time I plan to stay in this hotel again for celebrate anniversary with my wife, four season staff did prepared decoration and anniversary cake in room during check in for surprise my wife. Beside that, we also love their breakfast food,  trigona bar, and we spent almost whole day in hotel without going out. However, A bit disappointed during checkout, from first experience, usually staff will offer help to bring our luggage to car park when they saw us busy with two babies , pushing  stroller , holding bags and luggage. Overall we still had a good moment in this hotel, we will definitely come back again next year.",4,0.9442
Celebrated my husband's birthday at The lounge at four seasons.. Our food was prepared by chef Narinder and it was definitely a 5 star worth  The food was top notch and scrumptious with the lovely ambience.. All the food that we ordered were prepared with great compassion.. we were definitely astonished with the exquisite meals we recieved.. The salmon fish curry is worth trying.  I would recommend this hotel for any celebrations for their 5 star hospitality and amazing food. Definitely the best 5 star hotel in Kuala Lumpur.,5,0.9914
"We went to “Poor Seasons Hotel”. Our stay was terrible from the day one to our last day, we had leaking tap, yellow tap water (hotel blames it to be a faulty pump) which I could never take a clean shower for three whole days. Also on the second day we found two cockroaches lying on the floor. We were very disappointed with this hotel.  ",1,-0.9446
"I stayed three nights with my family and its the first time I have seen cockroaches in a hotel.  Even three star rating hotels trump this establishment.  Another disappointing thing about this hotel is the pool towels.  Pool staff emphasises the towels are not to be brought back into the rooms after usage and when my sister was draped in one near the lobby, a staff came running out to chase for the towel to be returned.   I cant believe the pettiness of this.  They also think their guests are thieves??  So they expect guests to be dripping wet and be freezing cold when going back up to the rooms.  Their gowns from the rooms don't fit my 140cm height little sister.  I heard she asked for a gown her size as it was stated to be available from the tablet in the room but was notified",2,-0.6503

Pleasantly upgraded to a 2-bedroom apartment as it was my birthday stay and the room together with its features were inviting, comfortable and luxurious.  The great view of KLCC and its fountain that the living area afforded me was great and entertaining.  The main bedroom had a panaromic view of KL skyline and it was such a dream to be able to wake up to such amazing views.  In all, the room was kick-ass.

The Quiche is light and fluffy with a lot of sauteed mushrooms and beef bacon. The OJ taste like real OJ (if you know what I mean..) without added sugar. The Canele's has similar taste like Malay kuih (which reminds me of caramalised kuih bakar ... ) and tasty. ",5,0.3818

Due to my individual health conditions, I need to be very careful with the food served in restaurants, especially during the buffet choice. I have sent my dietary requirements in advance to the hotel and they were just the best to accommodate it. Big-big thanks to Gurmit and Chef Mat. To every traveller, you can safely go to this place and do not worry about anything to be missed. Every member of the FS hotel is truly polite, very careful and thoughtful. I wish I could remember each name!  Also, the view that you get from the pool is magnificent. If in Kuala Lumpur, this is the only hotel the one should go! Highly recommended.",5,0.9877

Remarkable staff relation from the time we checked in right till our departure when checkout of the hotel! What makes this hotel highly recommended to potential visitors will be the amazing staff. Thanks to Haleela and the wonderful Indian Chef, we had a grand time celebrating our Brother's 51st Birthday in our room. Together with her and the Chef, we planned the menu for our family party of seven. The theme was Indian, of course, based on my Brother's favourite cuisine.

Upon arriving, the staff at the hotel were attentive and the hotel itself is beautiful. The hotel rooms and event spaces are stunning!

We had a one night staycation at the four seasons kuala lumpur during our 11th wedding anniversary with our 3 boys. Booking was easy. The four seasons app was really cool. I had a few chat with their staff using the app which was really convenient. Arriving at the hotel was easy. You need to park at Basement 4 for hotel guest. Then we took the elevator to the reception floor. Everyone welcomed us with smiles and friendly gesture. The friendliness was really genuine that we felt really welcomed. Checking in was a breeze.

From roast lamb carved in front of me, to fresh seafood on ice, to local Malaysian favourites (satay etc and multiple noodles made to order), all the way to even Mexican food! I loved the desserts, as always as well. Curate has an impressive spread, on par, if not better than the Mandarin Oriental and Shangri La Hotels in KL. Their service is par excellence and Team 4 Seasons went above and beyond preparing a cake to celebrate and surprise my son. We always feel so welcomed whenever we visit them. Truly valued for money when we eat there. ",5,0.9849
