"With travelling restriction applied, the only way to have a short breakaway was to do a staycation in Singapore. Spending a night at Skyline studio room was a decision that we never regretted. The room was spacious and the view was marvellous.  We were first welcomed by staff Tommy who did a detailed introduction in explaining to us of the facilities that is within the hotel. His choice of words and his tone made us feel extremely welcome to the hotel.   Apart from the rapid process of checking in, another memorable experience was dining at the Skyline Lounge. Most of the time, we were served by staff Malek who greeted us by our name. I have to compliment him for his superlative service. Despite of his business, he never fail to check on us repeatedly to cater to our needs. ",5,0.9729
"We are group of people from Initial Hygiene stay at one Farrer hotel during Malaysian Lockdown. The hotel is fantastic and staff are so friendly like Karen from concierge, and Mila from front office. Thank you for taking good care of all us during this hard time. If have opportunity to come back sure this will be the hotel I choose again. Thank you",5,0.984

"Came for buffet dinner with my family and the food was good although the variety is a bit small. The quality of the seafood was fresh and I particularly enjoyed the oysters! 😋 The service of the entire team was impeccable. Fadhil, the staff who served us, was observant and meticulous. He noticed that I didn’t have a dessert spoon and brought one over for me. He was also very polite and cheerful. Thanks for the great service! It made my family’s dinner that much better. 😄",5,0.9773
"We have stayed at One Farrer Hotel twice and would go back again. It’s about 20 minutes by Taxi. The rooms are large with a decent size bathroom. The breakfast is plentiful with lots of options and room service and pool bar is also excellent. What I really appreciated is that on our second stay they allowed us to check in very early at no extra cost as we wanted to self isolate due to the caronavirus that was becoming a pandemic. Staff were all wonderful. The pool is large enough to have quite a few people in it, so it’s a great place to stay for a few days where you can relax by the pool and have a few cocktails.",5,0.99
Mirza has superb excellent service. He went out of his way to provide us a birthday cake for our friend and always served us with a smile. He had a good sense of humor and attended to our needs! A place worth visiting! :),5,0.9837
"Overseas trip is, of course, not possible during this period of the evolving COVID-19 situation. One Farrer Hotel offers reasonable rates, with extremely clean and good amenities for a local 5-star staycation.   In particular, I would like to commend Ms Harmony Huang, one of your front desk executives. She had made the experience a more memorable and pleasant one. The service rendered was first-class, with much thoughts and considerations made for us.",5,0.9895

"We stayed over at One Farrer as a staycay with my friends and the hotel service was so good. Everyone was so friendly and they accommodated to all our requests. Staying at the 18th floor, we had very convenient access to the lounge and was served by Malek. He was so nice and so good and was so friendly.

"Wanted to support our local hotel by returning for a staycation at One Farrer Hotel. We opted for the Skyline Lounge package and was very delighted with the excellent services provided by Mr Malek and Mr Guna at the lounge. This is our third staycation in this hotel and we have been very impressed with the hotel facilities and services. The room is very spacious with free complimentary mini bar. We enjoyed relaxing at the swimming pool, working out at the gym. Strongly recommend this hotel for a wonderful family staycation.",5,0.945
"Great 5* hotel, all the amenties you could need and next door to the MTR which is essential in Singapore due to the heat and humidity. Rooms are very good with automation for lights, blinds and mood settings next to the bed, so no need to move unless it was my turn to make the tea ! But the best feature of the hotel was the staff.... super friendly, efficient and helpful. Situated in Little India, 2 stops to the main tourist hub of Clarke Quay",5,0.9463
"Wonderful service as soon as we arrived, extremely clean Hotel and rooms. So easy to catch the MRT from the hotel. The Loft room was very spacious with t.v's both down and upstairs and a big comfy king size bed. The staff are very helpful and I would like to to say a big Thank you to Yong ( I hope I got your name right) who took care of my partner and I as soon as we arrived.

"(+) : - Strategic location, just right beside Farrer Park MRT station. Around 5 to 7 mins walking distance. - Booked Skyline Studio room, it was spacious, nice ambience, cozy and very nice room to stay. - Super friendly staff. Good credit for Fadhil,  18th lounge staff. - Good service  - Food is very tasty - Good amenities, there is shopping mall nearby (City Square Mall) within 10 mins walking distance. - Nice swimming pool.

However overall, it was a enjoyable and memorable experience. We will come back again one day.",5,0.9897
"This hotel was fantastic, the staff were very friendly as well as having a great buffet breakfast which was separated into countries of the world to be able to try different foods from different places which I thought was a great touch. The rooms on the lower floor can be a little bit loud with events that are happening in Little India but otherwise a great stay! ",4,0.9575
"My wife and I recently returned from a weeks break in Singapore and One Farrer was our choice for accommodation. The hotel is located on the northern edge of Little India, right above the Farrer Park Metro station. It met all the requirements for a 5 star place to stay. The building was modern, clean, well appointed throughout, all the staff we met were really friendly, and the breakfasts were superb. We started most days with a swim before breakfast and had the Olympic length pool to ourselves. The taxi from the airport dropped us right at the front door on the evening we arrived and we experienced 2 of the best hamburgers we have eaten, anywhere in the world, poolside at the Sunset bar. The room, on the 15th floor, was luxurious, very comfortable king sized bed, quiet with a",5,0.986

This restaurant serve good food...but more importantly the excellent services. most buffet dinner, all setup was there and mostly self help...most is clear platea. This restaurant did it must better.

Thanks Mr Arjun!",5,0.8904
"I have stayed in this hotel on 5 separate occasions and always look forward to my next trip. Rooms are comfortable, hotel is clean, staff are friendly, facilities (wifi etc) work well and the pool is wonderful.   In particular I would like to mention the team that work in the Skyline lounge. Malek, Guna, Fadhil and Joni were so professional, competent and kind. They are certainly amongst the best staff I have encountered in any hotel around the world.   To summarise, it is a great hotel, well located (if you like being close but not right in the center of the city) and highly recommended.",5,0.9896
The hotel location is excellent for Indian travellers as it is located in Little India where you have ample of options for Indian food. Very close to Mustafa centre. Downtown and CBD area is also not far away and best this is this is just 2 mins from Farrer Park MRT so very convenient to move around. Rooms are a bit small but comfortable do opt for their Upgrade which included Lounge access. ,4,0.9846
"We stayed 4 nights in a Skyline room. Most comfortable bed we have ever slept in, great view. Room was very large on the 18th floor. No noise from outside. We used the executive lounge for breakfast and on an evening for drinks and a bite to eat. Only small selection of food but all very good standard. The staff in the lounge are first class Gunna, Joni and Malek. All are a credit to the hotel. We will stay here again when next in Singapore.",5,0.9729

Would like to complement Mr Malek for his excellent customer service. Will visit again soon and will recommend to my friends for this restaurant👍👍👍Thank you for the good service and variety of choices of food,4,0.9577
We arrived at our hotel very tired and a little late as our flight was delayed. I had booked 2 beds when we got to the room there was only one. They had none with 2 beds so they upgraded us to a beautiful suite. The reception has to be the best I have ever experienced. The breakfast was delicious and the choices were endless. Thank you for a wonderful stay!,5,0.945

The bathroom is very clean and has a big bath tub. We had the breakfast the next morning, it was delicious with a generous spread. Definitely will come back here!!",5,0.925
Great location right above Farrer Park MRT. 24 hrs shopping at Mustafa Shopping centre right across the road. Famous chinese eateries all within 1km radius of the hotel.  Free parking and also loving the teochew porridge supper at the hotel restaurant. Spacious room as compared to other city hotels within the same price range.,5,0.8799
"I have stayed here multiple times for the past few months and this review is long overdue. This Hotel have a good product, located convenient to MRT station and the next door hospital. It has all the amenities that a business, medical or family tourist needs. The spa with Japanese Onsen style, the pool, gym, business centre.   Breakfast is great with a wide variety of food and there's even local Udders ice cream now! It's quite sad that some of my favourite items from the buffet are no longer available though... Like the fruit compote...Hope they can bring it back.   The stars of this Hotel are definitely the staff. The Concierge, Reception, Communications, Housekeeping and Restaurant employees are the best and the Hotel is so lucky to have them. Some of these people are Mila,",5,0.9365
Stayed here with friends last week. Hotel is 10 minutes taxi drive from Marina Bay. Rooms were very comfortable and clean. Stayed in big room on top floor and views were amazing. Two pools both very clean with guest pool towels. Breakfast very good with varied choices. Would definitely recommend a stay here!,5,0.9195
"We booked an Urban Den Room with no breakfast for this stay as we were heading for Halloween Horror Nights which would end late and the location was centralized enough for us to get to and from Sentosa (5min walk to Farrer Park MRT).    Room was comfortable and did not show any signs of wear and tear from my last stay a few years back. Mini bar remained complimentary with tea, coffee and snacks. Toiletries were all provided by the hotel as well. Reached the hotel and wanted to check-in earlier however, was told the room wasn't ready and late check out wasn't possible as they are running a full house. Nevertheless, was still given the room 10min before check in time.   Tv remote had some issues and technician came to fixed almost immediately but channels were limited. However, Tv",4,0.7609

"I have stayed at One Farrer Hotel twice now in February. Everything exceeded our expectations. The concierge desk was exceptional and helped us look around the hotel prior to booking our first stay and were very helpful the second trip. The rooms are updated, clean, and very comfortable. We stayed in a mini suite the second trip.   We selected One Farrer Hotel the first time because of the pool, convenience to transportation, food selection, and friendly helpful staff. This second trip the service and overall hotel quality was even better. I have a very young grandchild and the pool was the perfect temperature for him. My son lives and works in Singapore so the convenient MRT made it possible for my daughter-in-law to come with my son, have an amazing breakfast and then go to",5,0.9585

The F&amp;B Manager, Patrick Venderwall and his team together with Rusty, Richard, Mike, Rhea, Arjun, Joey &amp; Herman were fantastic in ensuring we indulged in the experience.   The menu was curated well and the courses were paced well, without rush. Food was fresh and special Compliments to the Chef for the steak. It was immaculately prepared.

One Farrer hotel is excellent. Our room was spotless and had everything we needed. The bed was very comfortable and the room was nice and quiet.  The location of the hotel was a little bit outside the centre of Singapore but so easy to reach by the metro. I’d definitely stay again.,5,0.9956

"It was an unforgettable experience staying at the Skyline Studio.  The room was comfortable, big neat and clear. In the Skyline lounge, which is the best I have ever used! The staffs were friendly, especially Ms Joni Ng who provided an excellent and helpful services, always courteous!   The location just next to MRT, really easy to access another place.  This was my second time to stay at One Farrer, and I would highly recommend the Skyline range for this hotel!!",5,0.99
"Loved the rooms despite it being small. Super clean well equipped and nicely designed rooms with great views. Cool Japanese-y robes. Lobby and entrance has little character and feels like entering an office building. The nicer pool and restaurant is for club level access only so that was a bummer as we tried to enter given that it’s on our floor. Next to a hospital so location is meh, but the mall across the street has lots of good food options.",4,0.9873

"We stayed here for one night before our flight home.  An amazing hotel and really pleased we paid the extra for a Skyline Room which includes access to the Exec Lounge, separate gym and pool.  The hotel staff were amazing! Our flight wasn’t until 11.30pm after we had to check out by 12pm so they let us have the room until 3pm and use the Exec Lounge until we left.  The Lounge is the best I have ever used! It includes fives meals a day which we used even after we had checked out. In fact we didn’t need to buy dinner for two nights and the food on offer was so good. The staff in the Lounge are so attentive and helpful and def make this Lounge stand out.   I would recommend this hotel and paying that little bit more to get a Skyline Room. ",5,0.7283

"We stayed in a family room for a couple of nights. The rooms are huge with a super king and an additional double which was in an alcove separated from the main room by the bathroom. There was a huge selection at breakfast and there are lots of restaurants close by for dinner, including at the mall which is only a few minutes walk away. It's a great base for exploring the city, particularly with the MRT being right underneath the hotel. ",5,0.9448
"As a solo woman traveller arriving in Singapore in the early hours of the morning, I needed a hotel that offered a 24 hour service and which could offer advice on sightseeing etc to a first time visitor. One Farrer hotel met all these requirements and the staff and service were second to none! The staff on the concierge desk (Eugene Loke and Steffi Yeo) and the night reception were incredibly helpful and friendly and I left having enjoyed a great stay at One Farrer.  And, I might add, starting each day well fed with their yummy buffet breakfast!",5,0.9199
"It is a beautiful property and people there are extremely friendly. They will go out of there way to make you feel welcomed here.  The pool, food, jacuzzi etc., everything was very thoughtful and relaxing.   A lot of people have already mentioned Malek and yes he deserves it thoroughly. He has the ability of taking you on a virtual tour of Singapore and will let you know about each and every detail of tourist spots.   Joni Ng also deserves a special mention as she used to save us a bento box of vegetarian food which was a delight. She would take the pain of explaining each and every food to us so that we didn’t eat any non-veg item unknowingly. There was one more person who served us in the skyline lounge but I forget his name.   A bit of a disappointment was Chandra at the",5,0.8349
Had the best wedding reception ever. With a wide spread of Indian cuisine. Food was beyond amazing And combine with the upmost friendliest staff ever. Nothing could go wrong.  Special mention to Gurjeet.(hopefully I get his name right). Whom took care of my table and my friends very well. And whom always has a smile.

"Firstly: I dont know why nobody mentions this but Urban Den room is amazing for 3 people. Singapore hotels are expensive when you take triple sharing rooms in other 4 stars hotels like Ramada, Novotel, Hilton Garden Inn so one better opt for these kind of rooms which come for 6ft by 5ft extra bed &amp; TV. This is what wins for me as I was with family.  Location: Outstanding. One is near to the MRT, near to all India eating joints, cabs are easily available, less Indian population in comparison to some of the nearby hotels (even though I am an Indian :P), and it is right in the centre of the city with all major attractions nearby. And for that not so expensive   Amenities: Good lobby, amazing pool, nice rooms with friendly staff. Swimming Pool hosts parties which are free for",5,0.9884

"I would recommend it to nobody. Most of the staff is cold. Customer satisfaction I believe is the last thing on their mind. 1. Water won’t be served to you at your table during breakfast buffet. You will be told it’s kept on the table over there and to take it from there and there only. 2. Breakfast buffet is available till 10.30 AM and this is taken so seriously that even if you are not done eating by then at their overpriced restaurant, you will see waiters wiping your table in your face.  3. The escape restaurant which is just beside the reception will not serve you water if you walk-in anything during the day. Why? Because that water is only for restaurant use. You must go to the reception for that. Also water won't be provided after you checkout. How pathetic are these",1,0.9874
Awesome stay at this hotel. Gym and pool are great amenities.  Rooms are spacious for Singapore.  Service is great.  Only negative is breakfast can be crowded and cramped with a lot of food open. I would surely return. ,5,0.9878

We stayed for one night after arriving from Bali and before our cruise the next day. I booked a standard room and on arrival was upgraded to a suite. The room was spacious and very super modern with buttons everywhere to control the lights and blinds. Shame we wasn’t staying longer. I went for a swim in the 50m pool and breakfast was a huge variety but very busy. They arrange a taxi for us to our cruise and kept our luggage that morning after check out so we could have a walk around little India. ,5,0.9392

The Restaurant have to improve on bringing the food for everyone on the table at the same time, and picking it up when finish a bit quicker. We had to wait all the time.

The pool and bar area were also amazing. The pool was excellent for swimming lengths and the pool bar had great food and service. We didn’t have time to use the gym but it was large and bright and very new. If all this wasn’t enough to make you want to stay, our concierge, Azly, was so helpful.

"From the moment we arrived we were treated like VIP's.  Fantastic service, friendly staff, spacious rooms, everything was perfect.    The hotel is a short 2 station ride 5 mins ride to Dhoby Gaut, or browse around Little India / Mustafa market across the road and the large City Mall is also across the road.  We stayed on the upper floor in a superior room with access to our own pool and lounge.  In fact, I would really recommend this - the staff in the lounge were so nice and you basically have access to all the food/drinks you desire.  The rooms were large, whisper quiet and with a friendly note from the manager really made you feel super welcome.  In summary, in terms of service and facilities, I really cannot recommend this hotel enough.  Thanks for a brilliant stay.",5,0.9099
"My wife and I have briefly stayed in Singapore for a prospection activity for our future group travel groups. I was extremely impressed by the level of prefessionalism, care, attention and service excellence we've received from the first step we took in the One Farrer Hotel. The facilities are world class, the level of emphaty and coordination is really something other hotels in Singapore should model. We've stayed at the Skyline appartments which has it's own dedicated lounge, private pool &amp; gym and a separate check in just to mention a few. We shall recommend the experience from the buttom of our hears and for sure will be coming in future. A special gratitude goes to Adriana Charlotte and Malek.",5,0.9948
"I cannot day enough nice things about this hotel. Lovely modern , comfortable and spacious room and bathroom. Very good breakfast with a wide variety of choices. Staff at reception extremely helpful and genuinely kind. After I checked out I was going on a 15 day cruise after which my return flight was at midnight and checkout of cruise was at 8 am. I asked if I could leave my luggage with them so as to move freely in Singapore throughout the day and they so kindly accepted although they were under no obligation to do so. Special thanks to Mr. Nizam and to another gentleman whose card I unfortunately misplaced but who was the original one who helped me. I wanted to thank him before going to airport but he had gone off duty. To sum it up lovely hotel, lovely people. True",5,0.9917
"One Farrer hotel, Little India, Singapore  Superb location in Little India. Stone’s throw from Mustafa hyper market. Well connected by Metro, Bus and app based taxi within 50 m. Lots and lots of Indian food joints within walking distance.  Rooms — Very modern, all possible amenities, on the house mini bar, crisp  linen and soft bed. Hotel provided two queen size beds on request against booked one king size, the baby and us slept fine.  Food — Good restaurant, nice spread with variety of options for veg and non veg. Despite the morning rush, hotel staff did the extra bit for accommodating all guests with good hospitality.  Security — deposit/ credit card pre authorisation of SG $ 100 per night was taken at the time of check-in. This was not told by MMT at the time of booking.",5,0.9369
"My husband and I stayed here for three days on our way to Sydney. We received an exceptionally warm welcome and we were so grateful to have an early check in.  The Skyline room was good. Not amazing but good. The view was really cool, and the blackout blinds very black! We found the bed to be incredibly comfortable and the linen of high quality. The towels and the robes are too small.  The bathroom was lovely - we really appreciated the waterfall shower and the selection of toiletries. However, the strange and noisy clunky toilet door was a bit odd. And the hinge doesn’t reach the wall so there was a lack of privacy. Alongside this, the lock was very difficult to use.   The air con was quiet &amp; efficient - a godsend in the Singapore heat. The wifi was ok.   The real reason to",5,0.9357
My wife and me checked into the One Farrer Hotel for their Annual New Years Eve gala on 31dec2019.  Our one night stay in the hotel was excellent. Their staff greeted us and whisked us to our room very quickly. Amenities in the room and cleanliness were excellent and flawless.   The gala dinner event got us engaged immediately with opening number of a SOLID GOLD dance item to the theme of COPACABANA. The flow of the evening was smooth and the food were delicious. Staff were very professional And they remembered our names!! The evening concluded with supper!! They served roti Prata and Porridge right until 3am!!   We will be back!

Held my wedding dinner in Nov 2019 in this hotel. It’s a fairly new hotel and they have a huge pillarless ballroom with chandeliers which satisfied our requirements! They have 2 huge screens for couples to showcase their wedding photos which looked really grand. This is one special feature that they have and other hotels do not offer. Food portion is generous and we received many compliments that it is delicious as well. They offer both food portioning / lazy Susan requests for all tables. Bridal suite is very spacious and brightly lit. The private lounge which offers 4 meals a day is a nice touch to the entire experience! It made us feel really exclusive. Special mention to one of the lounge staff Malek who made us feel really comfortable and welcoming during our 3 nights stay,4,-0.7302
"Spent a week at One Farrer Hotel over New Year's Eve. We chose to stay in a Skyline room with lounge access. The lounge really made a difference, with complimentary good food served throughout the day in a nice and calm environment. Free drinks between 5.30-8.00 pm was a bonus. Great service by the lounge staff (especially Malek) too!   The rooms were reasonably spacious, clean and well-maintained. Nice big bed too.  The pool area was really good, with a huge pool and a sufficient amount of sun beds. The gym on floor 6 (open for all hotel guests) was reasonably well-equipped. The Skyline gym only had a few cardio machines.   The neighborhood wasn't the most exciting (although it's right by Little India), but there is a metro station right next to the hotel and with a taxi ride",5,0.991

"I have first discovered this hotel when I was searching for hotels in Singapore with Onsen, and this hotel came up in one article. Out of curiousity, I started to read reviews in tripadvisor and followed most of the guests tips which is to book the skyline with lounge access, and so we did. First stay was sometime in November. The check in was pretty smooth by Hanafie at the 18th floor, and we started to eat some snacks at the Lounge. There we met the ever enthusiastic Malek and Auntie Joni who were tirelessly serving us with everything that we needed even without telling them to. I was so impressed by their first class service and hospitality that we decided to stay again for Christmas eve.

"We had a wonderful 2-night staycation at the Skyline Studio with access to the skyline lounge which provides 5 meals a day. The food was fantastic but it was the warm hospitality and friendliness of the staff (Malek, Joni and Guna) who really elevated our experience and made us feel right at home. The room was classy, clean and very spacious. I think it's the only room (other than the sky villas) that has a bath tub. I especially loved the high ceiling and large windows giving you an excellent view of the city. Throughout our stay, the rest of the hotel staff were also all very helpful (during check-n / check-out, housekeeping, concierge) and did their best to make our stay extra special. Definitely recommend this to our friends and hope to return for another staycation soon!",5,0.9907

They could not do enough for us and the food and drinks were delicious and plentiful. We spent quite a lot of time in the lounge between sight seeing and it was the perfect place to relax before travelling around the city. We would definitely recommend and hope to return.",5,0.8074

Brilliant location central and convenient. Very close to Mustafa’s and City Square.  Good dining facilities, breakfast has a good spread. Only request declined was for us to get a decent packed breakfast to leave early they only offered the basic croissants and cut fruits. Fair enough I guess.

Having visited the hotel several times over the years since opening, services seem to go downhill year by year. Had a great welcome at check-in by Ms Sharmila this time - what an inspirational person indeed - but the rest of our stay was just ordinary and we didn't feel One Farrer Hotel delivered anything even close to a five-star experience during our 4-night stay. Felt our room on floor 12 was just ordinary, the breakfast was very ordinary indeed (you've scrapped many items over the years that used to be there) and the general feeling at One Farrer Park was, well, extremely ordinary.
