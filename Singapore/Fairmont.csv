Hotel has a fantastic team working there. They are so hardworking in ensuring that quarantine guests are well taken care of while abiding to the self quarantine measures and take guest feedback seriously. Hotel not only checks in with guest daily but have impressed to put the personal touch to what hospitality is all about. They have gone above their jobs to really ensure guests are truly happy just by paying attention to details; team surprised me with a local breakfast and also personally signed cards with messages to celebrate Day 9 milestone in my quarantine period. Really awesome hotel to stay at!!,5,0.99
"We stayed at this hotel for three nights on the way back from India.  It shares some facilities with Swissotel and is located adjacent to a shopping mall with lots of eating placea and shops.  You don't have to venture outside.  It's also opposite the Raffles and virtually opposite Chijmes which also has lots of eating places.  Great location on Bras Basah Road.  The room we had was very nice and appeared to have been recently upgraded.  Nice views over the city, the pools and tennis courts.  The facilities were nice.  Comfy bed, nice shower, a tap for hot and cold water, and a handy table and couch.  Breakfast was included in our package and was a very good buffet in Prego down at lobby level.  Our checkin was very easy and made even more pleasant by a very good staff member. ",5,0.9844
"I stayed here with my wife and 2 kids.  Although the Fairmont costs more than the Swissotel, it is just right next to it. In fact, the Fairmont being the short tower has worse views from the rooms compared to the much taller Swissotel.  Both hotels are very similar and I have stayed at both so I don't see why the Fairmon rates are higher.  I actually find that the Fairmont rooms are a bit old and outdated.  The hotel is connected to the Raffles City shopping mall with MRT right underneath so it is very conveniently located for shopping, dining and taking the train to explore Singapore.  The swimming pool is a common pool shared with Swissotel.  That means there are guests from both hotels using the same pool.  The pool is located in between the two hotels so the sun gets blocked",3,-0.4215
"Overall a great 4 night stay celebrating a birthday. Location is fantastic - a short 5 min Grab from MBS and most bars and clubs. Front desk staff at check-in were great, concierge was fantastic and helped out with balloon/cake/champagne deliveries, and the room views were great. Also recognition of Accor Gold which was nice.  The issues: some appliance made erratic relatively loud noises during the night (I believe it was the mini-bar as I powered off the water filter). There was one night where the water temperature increased suddenly for a short period of time - ouch",4,0.9819
"Fabulous place to visit, easy to get around, very safe &amp; so many beautiful places to see - Gardens by the Bay, etc.  The Fairmont hotel is well-located.  It has a stunningly beautiful foyer and rooms, with a fabulous swimming pool area too.  There is an excellent choice of  breakfast foods, with a different variety daily, and the food by the pool is also delicious.  The staff couldn't do enought to help you, they were so friendly and professional.  A wonderful stay in a great hotel.",5,0.9924
"Excellent accommodation,  beautiful decore and extremely friendly staff and helpful. Rooms very comfortable and clean. Excellent service at prego for breakfasts and gold lounge on the 25 floor. Pool was wonderful",5,0.9815
Stayed here for 3 nights to break journey to Oz and loved it! Carefully chose a Deluxe Harbour King room which are newly renovated. Got a great deal on Accor sale at about £500 for 3 nights B&amp;B. Good location right across road from Raffles for the bucket list Singapore Sling. Adjoins sister Swiss Hotel and large mall running around both hotels. Room fabulous with balcony with great view onto harbour and Marina Bay. Despite Singapore being very quiet Breakfast in the Italian Buffet Restaurant a bit too busy which was my only criticism. As first time here booked hotel limo transfer which although much dearer than taxi was a great choice. Friendly driver met us straight through security whisked us into nice Mercedes quick drive to hotel and straight up to our lovely room to check,5,0.9901
Would highly recommend this hotel. Staff couldn't do enough for us. We received an early check in and a late check-out. Room had been recently refurbished and was faultless. Location is ideal with a shopping complex located adjacent to the hotel. Breakfast was fantastic with a great choice. Would highly recommend staying at the Fairmont .,5,0.9622
"In these turbulent times, our stay at the Fairmont Singapore was an oasis of calm and luxury.   The accommodations were beyond expectations, the staff absolutely warm and friendly and the service first rate.     Most highly recommended.   Can’t wait to return!",5,0.8631
Hotel is well located with MRT stations just next to the hotel. Lots of shops and restaurants near by. Walking distance to Sands and Merlion park. Friendly and helpful staff. Pay the extra to stay in the newly renovated rooms.,4,0.7717
"An excellent Hotel on top of a beautifull Mall.  walking distance from the shops and restaurants.  Stopped here for a few days, good pool, good for children too.  Breakast was somewhat busy, but if you are careful with choice, you can get an extensive breakfast.  Rooms are large with good views.",5,0.8735
"We recently had 8 nights at the Fairmont Singapore in a Fairmont Gold room (45sq very generous in size).  We were located in the North Tower over looking the famous Raffles Hotel. Our booking had access to Fairmont Gold Lounge on level 25 for daily breakfast and evening cocktails.  The lounge is a very relaxing and inviting space.   If you'd like views of the city,  Marina Bay Sands and Merlion them request a room in the South Tower.  The hotel is well located for the use of public buses and MRT. It is also attached to Raffles City Shopping Mall but is within easy access to a large number of shopping centre.  A few of the restaurants were closed for refurbishment during or stay,  which was a little disappointing but didn't really cause us to much concern.  I cannot praise all",5,0.4902
"Big thank you to Marcus and all of the lovely staff that made our stay so enjoyable and memorable. The location, room, staff, lounge, restaurants and facilities were all exceptional. Almost everything is easy walking distance from the hotel and the MRT is only 2 mins walk. The hotel is attached to a fantastic Shopping Mall with many food options. We highly recommend this beautiful hotel and can't wait to return.",5,0.9751
"Great location with lots of shopping and dinning options. And there is a MRT station within 5 minutes walk that can lead you to bustling Orchard. Spacious and clean room.  Bed is comfortable.  We love the big tub too. Staffs are helpful and attentive. Overall, a pleasant stay. ",4,0.9657
work out something with the car parking issue. Most guest will dine and use the facilities. organise sports event and food festival. Promote membership for food discount etc. Advertise in e commerce website to promote room rates during of peak season.,4,0.8126
"Our 4th visit to the Fairmont, beautifully appointed, newly renovated rooms and Executive Lounge. Staff were (generally) very attentive. Food and Beverage and experience at Prego (ppr) was a little disappointing. Overall we enjoyed this stay and most likely would stay here again.",4,0.624
"The warm welcome we received on our arrival was maintained throughout our stay.  All the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful.  (Hazel, one of the Front Desk Team, deserves a special mention!, as does Mike, the Concierge!).  The view from our 18th floor room was, of course, stunning, and the little balcony was a great bonus!",4,0.9733
"Modern, well maintained hotel situated near Marina Bay area in Singapore. Large comfortable rooms. Recommend access to the Club Lounge for extra facilities and service. Situated close to Marina Bay with underground access to shopping malls and other atractions. Also MRT train station in shopping mall adjoining hotel. Staff all friendly and helpful.",5,0.9169
This Hotel was all that we expected of a 5 star.  Great staff - good rooms - perfect location.  Nothing  was too much trouble and when we reported a problem with the shower in our bathroom it was repaired within the 2 hours we were out sightseeing.  The bathroom was refreshed and clean towels  replaced the ones we had used that morning.  The one drawback is the lack of storage space for clothes etc. which the Hotel was aware of and looking to address.,5,0.7717
very nice hotel in the heart of Singapore. very polite employees. very spacious rooms which where well maintained. big shower area. proper coffee machine and complimentary still water. good WLAN connection. hospitality suite upon departure to freshen up for a long flight. TOP,5,0.9105
"Our one night layover was very comfortable, with excellent service at check in, directing me to an HSBC ATM in the adjacent mall.  Only problem was the in room water filter system in the mini bar. Water tasted funky - way worse than the tap water.  Those filters in 1623 need to be changed.",4,0.3306
"Poor service and lack of personal touch. We were not informed before hand that all the buffet restaurants are closed during this period. We were not offered complimentary room upgrade despite we were celebrating our 23rd wedding anniversary, we are Accor member and the hotel was extremely quiet during this period due to COVID 19 situation.",1,-0.9087
"This was my first stay in The Fairmont, and I admit I was a little nervous because I usually stay in the Pan Pacific Singapore or the Sofitel, so why would I want to stay somewhere different? Anyway, I arrived at the Fairmont early and to my joy, I was given not only “early check-in” but also an upgrade to the next room category! So here I am, taking in my gorgeous guest room on the 17th level of this stunning hotel. My exterior view is of the Raffles hotel gardens and pool. My room is immaculately presented in every way. The bathroom is spacious and luxurious, complete with deep bathtub and separate walkIn shower. Lots of bench space and storage. I love the convenience of my own iron and ironing board. The bed is supremely comfortable and I sleep deeply in my crisp white bed",5,0.9845
"I stayed 5 nights in this hotel and it was a really excellent experience. During my visit, the corona virus had begun to become present in Singapore and everywhere you went, the staff offered hand sanitiser and were taking great care of the guests health and safety. The service in all departments was excellent. In particular, I would like to mention Nisa Ghani in the pool bar area, Dennison who made excellent Pina colada and sangria, and  Edmande in the downstairs bar. But really all the staff were fabulous. The breakfast is one of the best you can imagine. Everything is on offer. there was a huge array of already cut fruit and vegetables so that you can make your own custom-made juice, the hot buffet was amazing - everything from ""make your own soup"", to delicious dim sum,",5,0.9923
"We booked the Fairmont in a Luxury Escapes package and highly recommend the hotel for excellent staff, beautiful rooms, cleanliness, hotel facilities,  and location. Cannot fault this hotel and will only stay here when in Singapore again.",5,0.9209
"Im happy to have booked thru Qantas. Arriving at the Hotel from a long trip Goa via Mumbia early morning ending after having spending 2 weeks travelling though India. Pleasant to find out what a beautiful hotel and upgrade offer to Delux room. Beautiful interior especially the bathroom with view of theBay and soak in the bath.Lush has bath bubbles you can buy from the shopping centre. I went to the pool on the 8th floor, then off shopping and visiting friends and family.Missed out on the Saturday night Bar Rogue due to busy day and dinner atHarry's Bay Quay side, but had a wonderful cocktail in the Skia Bar next night with friends (70 floor sister hotel Hotel Swiss Standford fairy lights view of the city). I have always loved Marks and Spencer so happily bought bra, cardigans",5,0.9866
"From the luxury car pick up at the airport, to the central location we had a great stay. We had a beautiful view of Marina Bay Sands and the adjoining areas. Canapés and drinks every night with an even better view, to using the gym were all a top rate experience. Our room was spacious and luxurious, well worth upgrading. Breakfast and dinner in the same hotel was great as well.",4,0.9678
"Great stay, Excellent location , Fabulous staff and Facilities. Wasn't my first stay at the Fairmont and definitely wont be my last. The Fairmont never disappoints with its luxury and spacious rooms.  Special shout out to Corinne at the front desk and the executive lounge. Very pleasant and professional",5,0.9697
"Excellent  hotel. Great location. Would definitely recommend.  Easy to get to places of interest and most of all, wonderful staff.  The rooms were quite spacious and very clean. Overall a very pleasant stay. The staff was very efficient and pleasant.   ",5,0.9883
"It was my first time in Singapore and Fairmont Hotel did an excellent job in providing us the best accommodation there is in the city-state. Special mention to Victor Loo, the front desk staff who tended to our needs and paying close attention to even the littlest of detail.",5,0.891
"This was a return visit to the Fairmont, having stayed here 3 years ago. Our room overlooking Marina Bay and the Pedang would be hard to beat with its floor to ceiling windows. The location above the Raffles Mall and next to the City Hall Metro station meant we were convenient for shopping, restaurants and travel connections. However, we ate at the Fairmont's Italian Restaurant, Prego, which is conveniently located near to Reception and we found it to be excellent. We are looking forward to staying there again on our return leg to the UK.",5,0.5106
1. Excellent location.  2. Great accommodation.  3. First class service.  One of the best hotels I have stayed in. Would be happy to recommend this hotel.  One of the best in Singapore.  The views are excellent.  Say hi to the doorman.,4,0.9801
"The Fairmont is the hotel we choose when visiting Singapore, and on this occasion we stayed for 3 nights on our trip out to New Zealand / Tasmania and 3 nights on our return journey.  We had booked a Fairmont Gold room for both stays, which gave us access to the Gold lounge where an excellent breakfast is served, and where, between 5.30pm and 7.30pm, complimentary drinks and food are served.  What stands out with this hotel is the way the staff ensure that you feel valued as a customer. As an example, in advance of our arrival I requested rooms with a Marina Bay view, and when we arrived at around 10.00am on our outbound stay not only was our room ready for us, but our request for a Marina Bay view was also honoured. On our return journey stay we arrived at the hotel at around",5,0.9022
"Had a 5 day break in Singapore at The Fairmont. Superb hotel in a great location with the famous Raffles Hotel and 'The Long Bar' just across the road. Many local amenities and attractions were within comfortable walking distance, but not all. The room at the hotel was spacious with a great view from the 21st floor and had all the facilities you would expect.All staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Breakfast was served from 0600-1030 during the week and catered for all requirements. The hotel was literally joined on to the Raffles City shopping plaza where there were many floors of shops and eateries. The city sightseeing bus tours main base was only a 10 minute walk away with 4 city tour routes to choose from, but the buses also stopped across the road outside Raffles.",5,0.9694
"This is the second time we have stayed in the Fairmont Hotel and it didn’t disappoint. From the time of our arrival to the time we left, we were treated like royalty- nothing was too much- check in was swift, our suitcases delivered in good time and the receptionist upgraded our room to Harbour view after realising it was my birthday- the view was breathtaking- I also received a beautiful box of chocolates, a rose and a lovely birthday card- what a beautiful gesture. The Fairmont is luxurious from it’s Le Labo toiletries to its sumptuous bedding, everything about this hotel oozes sophistication. We wouldn’t stay anywhere else in Singapore- thank you for looking after us so well, we will definitely be back.",5,0.9777
"The entire staff of the Fairmont Gold Lounge were delightful. We really enjoyed them and were thrilled that they agreed to a group photo with us. Amin and Micah gave us a lovely welcome and tour of the lounge and our Ambassador Suite. Amin went above and beyond. He was very communicative in emails before arrival. After arrival, Amin knew we wanted Peking Duck during Chinese New Year and wanted to make sure we didn't lose our dinner reservation. He ran down to the Szechuan Court restaurant himself to make sure the hostess held our reservation. To express our appreciation, we brought the Lounge staff the huge portion of the Peking Duck that we could not even begin to approach. Breakfast and hors d'oeuvres in the Lounge were great. Silas and Adrian in the Lounge were delightful,",5,0.9895
"Wonderful stay at the Fairmont ... a beautiful hotel ... we had a lovely spacious and quiet room with a view and the bathroom was equipped with quality products. We also had Lounge access which was certainly a bonus. All staff were very helpful, friendly and professional and we would have no hesitation in booking this hotel on our next trip to Singapore. ",5,0.9664
The room was a good  size but poorly laid out. The bed was far too close to window.Needs to have cupboard space both sides of bed instead of all on one side Not a room if you stay is more than two nights or you will be living out of suitcase.,4,0.2382
We stayed at the South Tower which is a newly furnished room on high floor with great city view. The room has two double beds so children can stay free with their parents. Gym facilities was great. The lobby team was also thoughtful to prepare a cake for my birthday upon arrival. Thank you. ,5,0.9493
"Excellent hotel, amazing breakfast and just right in the heart of everything for a city escape.  Hotel is above City Hall MRT so if you are brave it’s very easy to get around to all the tourist attractions.",4,0.9558
"Stay at this hotel for my family trips with 2-kids. The room booked through Accor under 2-Adult and 2-kids. As silver Accor member, some privileges given such as late check-out, welcome drink, and discount. Since I need a space to refresh before going to the airport late at evening, the hotel gave access to hospitality room where we can sit and relax.  Room is spacious, and twin-bed is big. The room is luxury with only one defect, the TV remote control is not working and I need to call to ask for battery replacement. The hotel need to check the room before stating ready for the next occupant. Due to the location of the hotel on top of MRT station and mall, it is easy to go anywhere at Singapore and find a meal.",4,0.9062
"Paying extra for the Fairmont Gold experience was worth while. The experience, facilities and staff were excellent.  The hotel is central placed within walking distance of many interesting areas. It was also directly above the City MRT station",5,0.8074
"What a splendid time we had. The rooms are exquisitely styled with attention to detail with comfort in mind. Very clean with well installed lighting and aircon systems, allowing us to sleep and rest well. The staff are all so courteous with so much sincerity exuding from their every action. Feel so welcomed with the wonderful hospitality extended to my family and me. Staff, from Check-in (like Cherly and Abbey at Front desk) to room attendant (pho), F&amp;B staff at all the outlets, in particular Pregos and The Stamford Brassiere, where they made us enjoy our scrumptious meals in warm and friendly atmosphere. I’m very impressed. Thank you Fairmont. My family can’t stop talking about the wonderful time we had. Kudos to the management; you must have done so many things right to have",5,0.993
"We stopped in Singapore on our way to the Fairmont in Maldives. The Fairmont brand is luxury and Fairmont Singapore definitely delivers in spades. Our room had the most stunning city view, the service was professional and prompt in every respect and we got special treats recognising a 50th birthday. The breakfast was one of the best we’ve seen with ample selection, and the club lounge a real treat. The location is perfect for easy access to all modes of transport. A definite hotel option for any type of stay in Singapore. Thanks Rob and the Fairmont team for a memorable stay. ",5,0.9732
"First time in Singapore and I do say first impression counts.  This hotel exceeded all expectations from a service, accommodations, amenities and location perspective.  I usually stay at the Westin because of my loyalty program, but I would definitely would consider staying at the Singapore Fairmont hotel again.    From start to finish the staff provided excellent services from understanding your needs, to ensuring your stay is the best experience possible. From the doorman to the bell hop to the front desk and the concierge, all were exceptional.  Thanks Fairmont staff for going over and beyond our expectations!  Our journey started when we had arrived earlier than expected, and rather than telling us to come back at 3pm, the front desk made every effort to find us a room that",5,0.9774
My friend and I stayed in this hotel for a two night stop over before going to Thailand.  We upgraded to a suite and were very happy with our newly refurbished room.  Our balcony directly overlooked Raffles.  ,5,0.7089
"Well situated hotel, very easy walk to many tourist locations. Huge selection of food, both Asian and Western at breakfast. Wi fi worked well. Check in and check out was easy. Doorman was extremely helpful. The Fairmont Hotel is very good value for money",4,0.9631
"Hotel is modern, very central, has metro in the basement as well as walk through from the hotel to a large shopping mall.  You can also walk underground through to a number of other shopping malls rather than brave the heat on the streets.  Complementary beautifully decorated chocolate cake sent to our room when we arrived as this was a birthday trip - a lovely unexpected touch that was appreciated.  The room was well appointed, we had a city view, breakfasts were excellent so much choice and great service from the staff.  Was so easy to go to Raffles, and the harbour area or hop on the metro and go further out. Would certainly recommend - pricey - but convenience and ambivalence worth the cost!",5,0.9624
"We stayed at the hotel in July 2018 with 3 children. Room was spacious, very elegant with very good beds and bath facilities. Breakfast was good, though quite crowded. Several good restaurants. One point worth mentioning - on the day of departure we had a late flight and hotel offered us to use a lounge - that was a real treat! Huge elegant room with same standard as hotel room as well as bath facilities was absolute perfect to relax and get ready to europe bounce night flight. No need to mention that Hotel is very elegant and personal is very helpful.",5,0.9891
You couldn't fault our room as the amenities were excellent and our harbour view was fantastic to wake up to.  The staff were very helpful and always smiled especially the doormen.  As it was our first trip to Singapore the location was central to a lot of attractions and the concierge helped us with what to see and how to get there.  We   celebrated St Valentine's day with High Tea at Anti:dote and would recommend the experience to anyone.  Overall an great experience which we will do again.,5,0.9822
"The hotel is in an excellent location and everything about it was beyond our expectations.  The room was immaculate, the bathroom was huge with tub and shower and the view from our balcony was wonderful. We stayed there a second time in January 2020 and chose the gold floor.  It was well worth it.  They checked us in at the lounge and had our room ready for us in the morning.  We enjoyed the cocktail hour that night and a great breakfast the next morning.  The service was impeccable. The room was newly renovated and as usual, the view was great. We will stay there again and highly recommend this hotel.",5,0.9826

"Decent and efficient business hotel. Good location on top of Raffles City complex with shopping mall and subway station on the premises - very convenient. Legendary Raffles Hotel just across the road. It is a typical high-end business hotel. Rooms were newly renovated with huge bathrooms with open showers and a big freestanding tub. View was decent from the South tower. My Fairmont Gold room however oddly did not have a desk, which was a little inconvenient for a business traveler. In the end, it did bother me much as we spent most of the stay working in our Singapore office. I would have complained and asked for room change if I had to work in my hotel room.

"We were in Singapore for a cruise but when it was cancelled at the last minute we were left with no flight home and nowhere to stay. Fortunately we had booked three days at the Fairmont for after the cruise and they were so kind, readily changing our booking so that we had three nights there and had time to get another flight home. This is a beautiful hotel and so well located. We used the readily available taxis to get around and the doormen were always available to hail one for us. The room was huge and the beds very comfortable. We had breakfast at Prego each morning, delicious and great service. We were also able to use the lounge on the 25th floor where there was great service, drinks and snacks and a fabulous view of the marina. Loved everything about the Fairmont and we",5,0.9944
We stayed in the newly renovated king suite. View of the city and harbour was amazing. Service was great and their staff were so friendly and greeted us every time we were on our way out or on our way back in.   Felt like we stayed far too short of a visit. They also even brought up a cake for my birthday which I certainly did not expect.   Their room service menu is amazing and they even had a 24 hour menu for some items. We even ordered around 3am with no complaints and great food.,5,0.9728
"A lovely hotel in a great location just above City Hall Station and Raffles City Shopping Centre. We were upgraded to a large room on an upper floor of the hotel. Our room was incredibly big, with a lounge area and large, comfortable bed. We had a nice view overlooking the pool and out towards the city.  All rooms have a balcony. The staff at the hotel were incredibly friendly and helpful. We had lounge access, which is situated in the South Wing and has a great view out towards the Marina.The staff at the lounge were very helpful and the service was amazing. We would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others.",5,0.9889
"Recently stayed at this hotel for 4 nights on our way to Thailand, on arrival we were offered an upgrade to a bay view room in the south tower with club lounge facilities. The room was fabulous, very tastefully decorated with great attention to detail. The club lounge was a brilliant idea, very relaxing and attentive staff food and drinks lovely, breakfast catered for everyone's tastes and the hotel location was perfect for seeing the beautiful sights of Singapore. Every member of staff we met especially in the club lounge and antidote bar were very friendly and helpful, will definitely return to this lovely hotel and gorgeous Singapore",5,0.9924
"The best hotel in Singapore is the Fairmont.  It is directly above the most central station which will take you anywhere here. The ambience, architecture &amp; rooms are magnificent. The hotel was recently renovated only months ago. It is the most technically advanced hotel that we have ever stayed in. The service is outstanding.",5,0.9369
Because of the corona virus the hotel was half empty so that I got an upgrade. The view was really nice. Room is well designed and comfi. Breakfast was great. Excellent to have free sparkling water distributor in room. Friendly staff. Positive is that the hotel is connected to the Swisshotel which has a great bar on last floor. All in all a good visit,4,0.9841
"Stayed 2 nights , arriving at 3am , we chose to upgrade our room to allow immediate check in as well as complimentary breakfast and Happy Hour drinks and snacks in the private lounge on the 25th floor. Our room had an excellent view of Marina Bay Area and we felt the upgrade was well worth the value. The staff is incredibly gracious and helpful. Walking in this area is very accessible to excellent malls and everything in Marina Bay area. Special compliments to the Breakfast Buffet chef, he provided excellent service, delicious food and a friendly smile to start the day.",5,0.9931
"Enjoyed 2 nights in transit at The Fairmont Singapore after a long business trip en route back to Melbourne. A perfect haven to rest and recover. Room very well appointed, service first class in every regard. Can’t wait to return. Rod ",5,0.8553
We had a room on the 21st Floor of the South Tower.The view across to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel  never failed to impress.  The view at night was spectacular as the Theatres by the Bay domes light up in red with the lighted towers of MBS behind them.  The Padang was flanked n one end by the SRC and on the other by the SCC. The Supertrees of Gardens by the Bay lit up as well with the backdrop of the Fullerton Hotel and the financial district.  The  South Tower room was spacious and well appointed.  Staff were professional and highly trained in all sections of the hotel from cleaning staff to front desk,5,0.5417
"From the moment we arrived and were greeted by James we were treated like royalty. Although we arrived at 9.30am, there was no problem gaining access to our room early.  The concierges were very helpful and seemed to know the answer to all our questions,  special mention to Fransen Lee.  It was my wife's 60th birthday, and James and Samuel ensured our room was decorated accordingly.   A cake, chocolates, cookies and a rose decorated our room.  We had a Gold Room, which entitled us to entry to the Gold Lounge, a separate lounge for Gold Room residents, with stunning views over Marina Bay from the 25th floor.  Soft drinks were available throughout the day,  and free alcoholic drinks including champagne, and nibbles were available between 5 and 7pm. Although the other restaurant",5,0.9476

"First time in Singapore, stayed at the Fairmont because of location and familiarity with the brand. Didn’t realize from other reviews that there was a difference between the renovations of the South Tower vs the older North Tower. The main Fairmont reservation line should take note of that. We stayed at older North Tower. Overall the room was a great size for three smaller size adults - beds are not true queen size so might be tough for some.  Also didn’t have water dispenser as noted in other reviews although we did get bottled water daily, and the water is potable so you can brush your teeth with no worry. Nice view of Raffles Hotel.  Great location with nice mall underneath and subway close by. Our room wasn’t ready when we checked in (we were early from a North America",4,0.8444
"Excellent stay, great location, very helpful staff. The room with the Harbour view was excellent, recently renovated, great view! The breakfast was fantastic, with a large variety of choice. A place to come back for sure!",5,0.978
"Stayed in Fairmont for 4 nights for a conference and leisure holiday in August last year.  Didn’t expect that Fairmont also got such fantastic view overlooking the marina bay !  The deluxe king room is very spacious. Got a large writing desk, another sofa and coffee table area, so both of us can each occupy a private corner.  Very unlucky, I was not feeling well on the second day and need to take rest in the room for almost the whole day.  But on the contrary, it gave me such a good time to relax in the room, enjoying the bay view, as well as the delicious noodle delivered from room service.  Breakfast are served both in the hotel restaurant and the pool side lounge. We chose the pool side for our breakfast cos there would be less guests. The choice of food is well sufficient",5,0.9401
"Loved this hotel! Great location, particularly for a first timer in Singapore. Made to feel very welcome from the moment I arrived. The room and view from the room was fantastic. Nice touches with the full control of lighting and curtains! Large, incredibly comfortable bed and lovely bathroom. Breakfast was excellent. Great choice of food to suit everyone. Staff at the breakfast service were particularly friendly and welcoming. Check in was very smooth &amp; quick. Checking out was easy enough too &amp; there is the opportunity of using the Hospitality room where you can freshen up or relax before heading to the airport if you have a later flight.",5,0.9938
This was an absolutely beautiful hotel I cannot say anything bad about it it was beyond expectation. It is perfectly situated at city hall metro station. It was so easy to get to from the airport jump on a train to City Hall come out of the train station and the hotel is right there it cost less than £1.50.

"From start to finish, it was a perfect holiday experience.  The checkin staff took time and carefully selected suitable room for us, 2 adults and 2 kids,6&amp;7.  The staffs were very friendly and professional at the same time through out the stay.  The porter took longer time than expected to come down with our luggages but no biggie.  The water temperature for swimming pool was just perfect! Wish they had more shades though.  Breakfast at Prego, had so many choices but after a few days of same food, you kind of change into something else, then you can go to other restaurant in the hotel. They all taste really good. The chef on the Gold Lounge can cook your eggs to perfection.  It was interesting to see the housekeepers had their own styles as well.  Overall, it was a beautiful",5,0.9879

"Besides the Lunar New Year’s mood, I was equally happy and satisfied that all things went well in the hotel. Be it comprehensive facilities, clean and neat layout room, good  meals and relaxing and refreshing massage treatment, the services provided by the staff were simply superb.

"The Fairmont was our first pick for traveling base as everything was close and easy breakfast options for everyone. We stayed in 12th floor with view to the sea, service was excellent and rooms clean and tidy. The choice of the restaurants was also perfect you can eat with 5$ or 150$ it’s your preference which you want. In-house metro stop The city hall is also convenient. Highly recommend.",5,0.9312
"We stayed in Singapore after a big family trip to Vietnam. It was a 'mini-moon' away from the in-laws for a few days, before meeting up with them in Changi for our return to Australia.  The Fairmont Hotel upgrade is definitely impressive. The reception staff are superb, and are exceptionally attentive to your needs.  The room, in the North Tower, are well appointed and I was upgraded to a beautiful view in celebration of an upcoming birthday. The reception also provided a box of chocolates, which was a lovely touch.  The beds are soft abs has a 'sink-in' feel. Nice for those who like it as such but I would have preferred a little support.   The room control panel is a nice touch. It manages the lights, the lamps, the curtains, etc. No need to play scissors, paper&amp; rock to see",5,0.9623
"From minute one we were made to feel welcome and special at this hotel. Superbly situated within minutes of so many places. The club room facilities were amazing and the breakfast was just incredible! Have to mention a few staff though that went above and beyond. Joanne Co was so attentive and friendly , making us feel like family. Also Shan from reception area was a font of knowledge about Singapore and a true gentleman. Congratulations Fairmont on selecting and keeping staff of such a high calibre. We will be back !",5,0.9711
"The reputation of Fairmont Brand precedes the hotel itself so anytime you stay at a Fairmont, you expect a great stay. This was my first time staying at Fairmont Singapore and it was superb.   The hotel is luxurious, the staff were friendly and welcoming.  We stayed in the Salon Suite Room and it was big and spacious for Singapore standards and the amenities were great. I love that the room provided a water machine for drinking (go greeen by providing no plastic bottled waters). The bed was comfortable and we had a great night sleep and in addition, the bathroom was spacious as well (although there was no bathtub)  Location was also excellent. It's only a 20-minute drive from/to the airport, 5-to-10-minute drive from/to Orchard Shopping Area and few-minute drive to Marina Bay",5,0.9866
"The hotel is strategically located with many shopping centres and an MRT station nearby. Breakfast was enjoyable with great food selection. The room was clean, luxurious and spacious. The harbour view was breathtaking. I set the room temperature at 24C, but the AC always cooled the room lower than the set temperature. Not sure what I did wrong on this. The curtain can be opened or closed with a button. Unfortunately the mechanism in my room was not strong enough to close or open the night curtain fully, so I needed to tug it. The bathroom is clean, spacious and nicely designed.  Facilities in the hotel are excellent. The pool, particularly, is large. The gym is nice too. The staff were generally polite and helpful. There's a minor hiccup during check-in. The check-in staff told",4,0.9033

"If you are looking for THAT Hotel that gives you: 1st Class Service, Ideal Location, excellent accommodation and a place where you can really relax, The Fairmont Hotel is for YOU. ALL the staff my wife and I encountered were always smiling, helpful and generally went out of their way to see to your every need. If you really want to spoil yourself take up the Club Lounge Package. In The Club Lounge as you enjoy your evening cocktail, feast on the tapas style menu the view to Marina Bay Sands is hard to beat. The excellent Block Out curtains ensures you are not woken up with the morning sun.",5,0.9652
"An exceptional experience. Great location (nextdoor to Raffles Shopping Center)  The staff..EVERYONE..was helpful and courteous. They go out of their way to help their customers. Superb customer service!!! Beautiful hotel and luxurious accommodations. Great view, too, of the bay from the 24th floor. Comfortable bed.",5,0.9837
"I had a terrible experience at the TWO STAR DUMP!!!!! The lounge for waiting customers had hot water and instant coffee. Classy? I think not. But the big problem is that I had to wait over five hours for my room. I arrived at 10 am from a 23 hour trip. At 12 o'clock, after waiting I went to the desk. They ASSURED me that my room would be ready very soon. I waited and waited. Technically they have until 3 pm to have my room ready.  Well at 3:15, after numerous visits to the front desk, they informed me my room was ready. THEY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE ROOM READY BY 3, and NEVER TOLD ME IT WAS READY UNTIL I ASKED. Next time you go to Singapore, stay at the Swissotel, next door. We had friends stay there and they were treated like royalty. And the accommodations were better, too. Skip",1,0.9752
"Very noice place with dedicated staff always there to help you with greta tips on the city. The hotel is very well located.  i do recommand this place if you stay fo rbusiness and want to have a glance of the city or for a leisur etrip as it is close to everything , and very easy access to the airport",5,0.8906
Excellent location and great staff. Very good size room and facilities. Shopping in Raffles city is very good. We did mst of the shopping in there. The MRT station is well connected with the hotel. It makes it very easy for travel to other favourites in Singapore. ,5,0.9611
"First time to Singapore and could not have asked for a better location.  The hotel is a two minute walk to the City Hall MRT, linking you to Orchard Road, Marina Bay Sands, Gardens by the Bay.  For closer places like Arab Street and Little India, the walk is about 15 minutes.  To/from Changi is +/- 20 minutes. Taxi or Grab is about 25 SGD.   As for the hotel, the service is just ok.  Our four night stay was not memorable at all.  For a five start luxury hotel, you would expect staff interactions.  A hello, welcome back, how is your stay...that goes a long way.    Guest room was large, internet was efficient and quick. The bed is VERY uncomfortable and even with a mattress topper, it did absolutely nothing to help.  Mattresses cannot be made for everyone but wow, that was not",3,0.8529

"I stayed at the Fairmont for 3 nights and it was fabulous. On arrival, I upgraded to a harburview room for a modest charge and I had a luxurious room on the 22nd floor, with balcony views across to Marina Bay Sands. The room decor and facilities were excellent. I particularly liked the automatic curtains that could be controlled from the bed, and the drinking tap and loan of reusable water bottle to help reduce plastic use.  Breakfast was plentiful and varied. I had room service late one evening and it was good quality. The hotel is centrally located right by the MRT, making it ideal for exploring the city. Several attractions such as museums and gardens by the bay are walkable.  What really makes this hotel special, however, is its staff. Everyone was very welcoming, friendly",5,0.984
"I always stay in this hotel when I visit Singapore. Being a regular in this hotel, they usually upgrade my room which I am thankful for, however, I still find the air-conditioning not that cold even though I turned it down to the lowest temperature. Also their breakfast this year during the CNY period was held in the ballroom and there were lots of activities for the little ones and my kids enjoyed it so much, thank you for the extras the hotel has put in for the guests.",5,0.8008
The hotel was very accommodating for all needs. The Staff were very helpful and friendly. Only the Breakfast went down early morning and the bread felt stale and the quality and availability of fruit was small,4,0.762
"Love the location.  Very convenient.  it is close to the MTR (subway/train station) and the hotel is within the Raffles City shopping mall.  Lots to shop and many restaurants, café within the shopping mall as well as nearby the hotel.  Walking distance to many attractions.  Check in is quick with very polite and approachable front office staff.  Good size room with the usual toiletries and free bottled water.  I was given a room at the low floor even though I have requested for a room on a high floor.  So there is no view at all.  A disappointment compared to the neighboring Swissotel The Stamford that I stayed previously.  As I was only staying for 1 night.  It doesn't matter much.  All is good until I heard loud voices chatting when I was in the room.  Initially I thought it",3,0.8824
"We enjoyed our 3 nights at the Fairmont Singapore, much in thanks to the incredible people who work there, most notably the front desk, housekeeping and porters. They take time for little things like saying hello or waiting a little extra to open doors and elevators. Our room was much more spacious than we thought, and the cleaner did a great job making the room immaculate for us every afternoon.  The gym is super clean and spacious, with all the weights and cardio equipment we could ever need. The spa is also amazing, with a steam room, sauna and various hot/cold tubs. The pool = perfection, and not too crowded.  I have 2 comments: the decor of the hotel, both inside and outside, is a bit on the drab side, which creates a kind of dark and gloomy vibe — which doesn't match the",5,0.9814
We stayed at the Fairmont on a stopover from Sydney to the UK. We have stayed in many world class hotels with this being our number one. Luxury throughout with the staff very helpful and courteous.   The suite room 1531 on the 15th floor looked out across Marina Bay with the view amazing.You can control most of the room even the curtains from your bedside.  This is a world class hotel we would recommend to any travellers.  Bob (Aberdeen) UK,5,0.8576

"We stayed at the Fairmont to celebrate the Lunar NY and had a wonderful stay.  It's hard to find a fault with this hotel, everything was perfect for us.  We enjoyed the complimentary gym, jacuzi, steam room and sauna everyday either before breakfast or before bed.  The hotel is located within the Raffles City Shopping Centre with City Hall MRT right below so the location is ideal for visitors.  Our room overlooked the Raffles Hotel across the road.  I booked the room at the hotel as an Accor member. ",5,0.9552

Our room was large and well maintained, the bed really comfortable and the view amazing.    The pool area is large, although we think it is shared with another hotel, there were still plenty of sun beds.   We’d definitely stay here again.",5,0.9686

"The Fairmont is well positioned in Singapore, right on top of a major train station and shopping plaza. The rooms are large, well appointed and serviced. The restaurants all provided quality food and beverage at reasonable pricing. An excellent resort pool and plenty of bars to chill out.

A huge thank you to Hazel at Front Desk, who made our experience awesome from check in to check out and everything in between.",5,0.9606
"We have stayed at Fairmont a few times over the years and each stay exceed our expectations and leaves a memorable experience. Each stay we have been lucky enough to stay in their recently renovated rooms which reflects Fairmont being on top of their game. The newly renovated rooms were fun (in room technology, water fountain), sophisticated added a touch of luxury to our overall experience. It was great to feel truly on holiday and enjoy all the amenities offered in the hotel.  Will definitely be back again. ",5,0.9779
We had a great time over the CNY holidays. Great breakfast options at Prego and I’m happy to see that the menus (even the room service) had options for kids. The only thing we did not like was the aircon controls in the room as even if we lowered down the temperature it was a bit warm for us. We failed to report this though given our short stay. We will definitely return again sometime in the Future.,5,0.9215
"Real sheer feeling of staying at Fairmont Singapore over Lunar New Year period.Location is superb- 15 minutes walk to marina bay area or Orchard road.Beautiful New Year decor ( together with Swisshotel next door) ,Gym, pool,hot bath all good ( even with cold water and fresh fruits provided onsite) Breakfast quality is just sensational with sumptuous choices and varieties of west meets east ( chinese, indian, jap all offered at once) The astoninshing offer of this hotel is providing ""the Hospitality Lounge"" for checked out guests with a cool shower facility before boarding night flight - trully a deep thought of hotel management considering the humid climate versus guests' comfort- this definitely provide a long lasting memory with all guests and will  draw them back for sure.",5,0.9585

"The location was superb. I liked the housekeeping done in our room, especially the toilet. I also want to mention Nisa Ghani who was handling the breakfast crowd at the swimming pool. On the first morning, it was full and the only available seat was the sofa. She cautioned us that it was not the most comfortable place to have breakfast. We did not mind and took that available seat. Later, when tables were available, she came back to us and asked if we wanted to move to comfortable seating for our breakfast, which we did. In comparison, the second morning at Prego, after being seated, our coffee only came after the third reminder. Since our first two orders for coffee seemed to fall on deaf ears, I made the third-order through a Chinese national server (I did not get her name,",4,0.3318
"Very pleasant 4 night stay. Very comfortable rooms.  Ideal location, the city Hall MRT station is  within few minutes walk. We took a taxi to the Gardens by the Bay, which cost just a few dollars. The views, especially from the gold lounge, were spectacular. Our room overlooked the Raffles hotel.  The breakfast in Preggo had such a large choice and had everything we wanted and much more.  The staff throughout the hotel were very good, helpful, polite and accommodating. We want to highlight 5 members of staff who stood out in terms of customer service. There is Charlene ( a trainee) , Suanshion and Amin (the manager ), who works in the Gold lounge; the concierge Fansen, and Shaun from luggage services. We will certainly stay here again on our next visit to Singapore.",5,0.9687

"we stayed here for 4 nights in late January.  check-in staff were very polite and courteous. After checking in, i realized that they had charged me more than double what I had booked through the hotel's website. My fault in part, because I should have checked the amount when I put in my pin number but missed the charge amount. Anyway, they were very apologetic and attempted to remediate the issue immediately.  we stayed in a harbour view deluxe room, which was on the newly renovated south tower, overlooking Marina Bay. level 17. The room was awesome, the view spectacular. I couldn't believe the amount of automation and technology that went into the room, hands down one of the best thought out layouts in any hotel I have stayed at.   -	Breakfast – is down stairs at Prego, not bad",5,0.9393

"This hotel is one to strongly consider when visiting Singapore.  The location, cleanliness, service levels, rooms, check in process and general spirit of the hotel are all superlative.  Can't fault much of anything.  A couple of minor issues - the Concierge could have been a bit more knowledgeable and the Prego restaurant (during breakfast) was a little overwhelmed by a rush situation, but both issues were minor.  The hotel is built over and next to a shopping mall and ""Street Food"" location so shopping and dining options are plentiful.  Hop on hop off bus pick up is across the street as is Raffles Long Bar for the obligatory Singapore Sling experience.  Overall, an outstanding and well run hotel that provided an experience that, in my estimation, would be hard to beat.  ",5,0.8759

You made our stay such a delightful and memorable experience. We visited this beautiful country to celebrate my husband's birthday.
