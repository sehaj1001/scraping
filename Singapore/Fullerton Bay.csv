"Awesome food, service , and of course ambience.  Fullerton service is no doubt one of the best, love our rendang &amp; laksa lunch that recommended by the friendly waiter. Every bites of the beef rendang I was mesmerized by the tenderness and the richness of the spices.  The Laksa, is the best we had so far!! My hubby gives it 5 stars ! The salted egg chicken wings also winner.. Very crispy and well marinated. I cant wait to come back here again. And I was given another bday cake :) happy !",5,0.9875
