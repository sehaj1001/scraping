" 5 star location   5 star service,  5 star Customer Care  5 star attention to details 5 star CSR  Better than most 5 star hotels   Location Excellent location near to MRT, bus stops, market, shopping centre, temples, churches , art centres even hospital   Its possibly the only Ibis that gives u everything u need. TV mini bar, kettle , free coffee tea , iron and ironing board, free bicycle, free phone, free refill water , special pillow request, u name it they give u  So much effort has been put in with regards to their CSR, no plastic water bottles, they give u refillable glass bottle, no plastic tubes of shower and soap but dispenser type. Free bicycle to encourage u to reduce carbon footprint and exercise, out source gym membership, even pens are made by some children from A",5,0.965
We have enjoyed our stays at ibis Singapore on Bencoolen Hotel when holidaying in this beautiful city. It is located very close to the city centre and is a very modern hotel with very comfy rooms and delicious breakfasts.,5,0.9122
I found this hotel to be awesome - arrived early and they let us check in early - staff very helpful - they booked tours for us - the buffet breakfast was great so much to choose from. Rooms very clean and tidy and the cleaning staff so great they even made a dog out of towels put on the bed with a note wishing us a lovely day. Close to markets - 7-11 next door - just awesome.,5,0.9821
"Stayed a week at Ibis Bencoolen. great place, service, location. Lovely bed - large queen - very comfortable. Had hanging space, shelves, iron, ironing board, hair dryer. excellent bathroom - hot water. Great brekky/service - all the variety you can imagine - incl teryaki chicken for brekky!! - No we couldnt!!   WOW.  Also special omlette chef - very special. Also Indian, Japanese, Asian as well as traditional eggs/bacon, baked beans, tomato, hash brown, pancakes, pastries, etc,  fruit, teas/coffee, milo. Only downside was,  we - coming from a warm place - had trouble adjusting to the cold of the hotel - and many other places in Singapore. Recommend you have something warm to wear!! We did take advatage of an ACCOR special deal - 30% off incl buffet brekky. Within 10 minute walk",5,0.927
"Nice basic hotel in central Singapore, close to all amenities. Nice room with everything you need at hand. Good buffet breakfast with choices to suit most nationalities. There is a restaurant and bar which serve reasonable food, but Singapore offers so many choices of food outlets , we only used it the night we arrived. We used the bar a couple of times, but the seating was in the same area as the restaurant and a bit basic. The staff here were really pleasant and helpful, and coed well with the stress of the corona-virus hanging over everyone. All in all a good base to use in Singapore.",4,0.9561
"On arrival, slightly disappointed by harbour view room, which seemed dark and felt slightly cold and damp...but we'd kept our promise to bring much-need rain!  Hotel pretty well placed and taxi rank right outside, which is useful.  Room rather 'basic' and small in size but adequate. As clean as you'd expect of this chain and a well equipped room, with TV, iron and ironing board provided, fridge, coffee machine and kettle with tea-making facilities.  Also a desk and chair.  Free wifi in the room until you check out...so make sure you've done everything you need to do before you check out! Beds were comfortable but very lightweight so every time I went to sit on the edge, it moved a few inches! Bathroom also very small and no bathroom stool but bath sheets a good size and hand",4,0.9843
Second time staying here. Great location with 4 MRT stations within easy walking. Smallish rooms but well set out..very comfortable bed with soft linens. Housekeeping by Nancy superbly and efficiently done every day..usually all finished on returning from breakfast. Breakfast hast a good array of different cuisines. Check-in/out very efficient/friendly. Only downside is there is no pool. Will definitely stay here again. ,5,0.9506
"Best service ever!! I stay with my friends on my birthday and the hotel staff gave a surprise gift.  The room is clean, not big but still okay.  The bathroom: clean and need more toiletries.  Need to upgrade the refrigerator, not cold at all.  Nearby Area: you can find minimarket 7/11 beside Hotel, across the road have small restaurant that open till midnight and Korean Supermarket. Walk few minutes you will find Albert Court food court, best place to find having breakfast or lunch.   All the minus paid because of good service...  Thank you Ibis Bencoolen, especially for Heme, Farah and Durges   ",5,0.9806
"The hotel is far from MRT though they have shuttle service but you have to follow their timings. The corridors at night is noisy, we called the reception for how many times and they cannot do any thing about it. We even place a silence sign for us to have a good night sleep. Nothing to boast about this hotel. It’s typically designed and far from MRT and subway.",3,0.4215
"good in general, room is clean, but no slipper in room and no regular maintenance on shower head, some room with good shower head but some not. Access to gym &amp; minibar is subjected to change, not like last time, Gold member is entitled by default.",4,0.2582
"Spent 3 nights there over Christmas. The location is great as a base for exploring the city; the MRT station is a 10 minutes walk. The room was spacious and quiet and had everything I needed. The staff was friendly an helpful, and I received outstanding service from a staff member in the restaurant, he went above and beyond and I very much appreciated it.",4,0.9564
"Close to several public transport options, ensuring easy and efficient access to the sights around Singapore. Great service at check in, and room kept clean during my three night stay.  My one complaint being the Ibis chain of hotels make a huge deal out of encouraging guests to re-use their towels for more than one day. I am more than happy to hang the supplied towels to re-use the next day. However, I found that the towels were replaced each day, despite my hanging the used towels to re-use. Maybe this is a short term measure, to reduce risk of spreading the corona virus. ",4,0.9637
"I have stayed at IBIS Bencoolen many times. This time, I notice that there were no small towels in the toilet of the rooms anymore. I feel that the face towels come in needy for occupants. Anyway, hotel staff were all very well mannered. ",4,-0.2975
"The hotel is in a great location - close to transport, shopping and food precincts. The rooms are a good size, clean and beds are super comfortable. Good wifi service and the staff are really helpful. We really enjoyed our stay.",5,0.9788
Rooms are decent and fairly cleaned. Best this bg about Hotel is that it is ideally located between hub of popular places in Singapore. Everything is at minutes of walking distance.   From right outside hotel public transport is available to any place in Singapore. Breakfast options are fine but limited for Vegetarians and Vegans. Can be improved!!  Overall 4*,4,0.8475
"Good hotel actually. easy to access, good location Clean room I love the laundry set / (iron/ironing board) provided in the room. Breakfast quite nice and very various kind of food Staff are all helpful",4,0.9661
We stayed here 3 nights and found it to be an excellent hotel at a very reasonable price.The rooms were very clean and the beds were very comfortable.Very central and a very nice variety at breakfast which cost fourteen dollars .WE would certainly stay here again.,5,0.9039
"Singapore accommodation is not cheap, so comparing price, location, rooms and amenities the hotel was the right choice. We also liked to have a welcome drink which included, quite unusual, whiskey, and free and fast WiFi was another plus. What I really want to mention was a gesture of the ""Housekeeping"" Julie; a handwritten Happy New Year note and the towel arranged resembling a rat; well; it's the Year of the Rat. Look at the picture!",4,0.9412
"Friendly, helpful staff. Taxis easily accessible at the hotel. Central location, walking distance to fabulous malls. A cash exchange machine in the lobby which was very useful. A 7/11 shop right next door.",4,0.9336
"I was almost satisfy with my stay, starting form check-in, no more plastic bottle in the room, water provides at L3, nice breakfast. Unfortunately, 15 minutes before 12pm, I encounter the inconvenient incident. Can't open my room three times (going back to receptionist 2 times). Waste my Breath and my time. WHY on earth did your system block my Card before 12pm (check-out) time? What happen, if I am with my 82yrs old mother? And your receptionist didn't even care for any APOLOGY. NOT NICE for Asian type of people who were supposed to be humble.",3,-0.8785
I am a very regular client of accor hotels around the world and i must admit that i was very disapointed by the service that i received at the Beecolen hotel.  A lot of issues to resolve. The housekeeping service was very very slow etc                                                                                                           ,1,0.5267
3 of us with the same membership status checked in together with one of them have special welcome pack and another with 2 bottles of water in glass bottles while I have nothing except the usual 2 bottles of mineral water in plastic bottles. This ain't the first time we are treated differently though we are of the same membership status. Hope equality and fairness can be considered.,3,0.8225
"Less excitements compare to the first stay. Probably because the room rate is up but the international buffet breakfast quality is declining. The hotel guests comprised of international tourist and most of the time you'll gotto wait for check in, table available during breakfast peah hours. No bottle water provided and u gotto pour by yourself whenever you need by using the bottle prepared in dining table. It's quite cumbersome. ",2,0.0909
"My apologies that I took long to review this place. We came here late that night and was accepted with open arms. I sincerely wish to thank the Malaysia lady who was on night duty. She was so helpful, considerate and above all so friendly. We were really blessed to be brought here by a very sincere taxi driver. In fact people in Singapore are so helpful and friendly. Being at Bencoolen gave us a great chance to visit many great places there. Loved staying at this hotel with my son because the environment everything we needed. Thank you Ibis!",5,0.9946
very easy to reach ibis singapore on bencoolen. MRT Bugis station  exit C and only take 10 minutes. Near to bugis street and bugis junction. Good hotel for holiday in singapore.one day I will coming this hotel again...,5,0.8464
We stayed for 6 nights and were so happy with this hotel. Firstly the location was fantastic.  Heaps of eating options within a 100m radius. We are vegetarian and we had at least a dozen vego restaurants and cafes to choose from. Local market shopping plus more  fancy malls all in walking distance.  This hotel gives you glass bottles that can be refilled for free. There's a laundry on site. Perfect for family holiday!,5,0.9603
"Due to a lost passport at the airport, we hadn't book prior therefore caught a taxi to the Ibis... Staff were amazing and we were booked into a room immediately after such a stressful 4 hours at the airport... Thank you to all the wonderful staff... We will stay there again next time.. Regards Evan &amp; Lee  Australia",5,0.6597
"Rooms toilets not clean , sparse toiletries  refreshment not refilled  . Poor facing - facing a temple  Accord Priority check in desk as not attended no courtesy to advise    We did not get our choice of stay at Mercure at Stevens Road concierge staff on phone say not available fro free night and free night could only be  redeemed at Ibis Bencoolen ",2,-0.4642
"Situated in a very handy location. Very friendly and helpful staff. Loved the buffet breakfast. Neat and tidy rooms with lovely views. With all amenities on board, Had a pleasant stay will highly recommend",5,0.9731
"As with all Ibis hotels, the room is fuss-free and clean. Plenty of affordable food around the hotel as this is student area with Bencoolen MRT just 500m away and a bus stop right in front hotel too.  They also provide self service laundry room and refillable hot &amp; cold water dispenser. If come to Singapore I will certainly stay here again 👌🏻",5,0.4404
"The hotel is good for spending few nights only. The room was quite small, the bathroom as well. We booked a STANDARD ROOM WITH QUEEN BED. We did not have much space to move around in the room.   However it was very clean and tidy. Service was very good. Location is good as well. Around 8 mins by bus or car to Orchard St. Around 8 mins walk to Bugis shopping mall.",3,0.9312
I chose this hotel as it is close to the MRT line Downtown and not too far from the airport. The rooms are basic but clean. Standard like other Ibis hotels so nothing to complain about. Staff are friendly.,4,0.9344
We booked a room with additional benefits. The additional benefits include free minibar + cellphone with unlimited data. The minibar is one coke and one sprite. Cellphone not available + when I told them they said ups we are sorry but can’t do anything about it. I insisted that they at least should have told us at the first day. They said they don’t have it since October now and then I asked them why they even still have an ad in their own elevator and the answer was we can’t remove it because we have no other thing to put in there. After discussing for 10 min they offered us one breakfast (we are a couple) and said that’s all they could do. After half an hour they offered me to give me round about 50€ back (not close to what I paid in addition to the normal room) and I never,2,0.2023
"The Ibis on Bencoolen Street in Singapore was fine for a drink but without much atmosphere or local colour. We went there two or three times for a bottle of wine, but basically only because the Ibis was close to the hotel at which we were staying. So, o.k., but nothing more.",3,0.1027
Great location within the city and walking distance to both Bugis and Rochor MRT stations. I found it very easy to navigate the MRT system. Most of the main attractions and sightseeing spots were within close proximity to the hotel. No more than 30mins to get to from either Bugis of Rochor stations. Very lively and busy with the shopping centres around Bugis. Great selection of places to get food. There is a 7-Eleven right next to it which was convenient for getting snacks and drinks. I stayed for 6 nights. Rooms are of a good size and cleaned daily while I was out and about. Prices were high due to staying during the last week of December and going into the New Year. I would recommend staying here due to its location! ,5,0.9677
"Excellent location and close to Bugis Junction shopping centres. Easy walking distance and handy to vegetarian restaurants at Fortune Centre and hawker food stalls. Friendly staff, nice clean room and comfortable beds. Short Walking distance to Bencoolen MRT station and travel two MRT stations to conveniently reach China Town shopping centres.",5,0.9565
"Value for money, good location, room is clean and quite, close to shopping mall and hawker centre, national library too.  I will stay in this hotel in my next visit. Online checkin service is good too, save time to queue up.",4,0.9201
"We returned to this hotel after a couple of years in other hotels in Singapore to find the staff welcoming and professional. The rooms are comfortable with all the essentials. We like staying here as it is easy to get to our favourite places buy train or bus, with the train station a short walk away.  Unfortunately we had to cut our stay short by a couple of days due to an emergency at home. The hotel was good enough to give us a refund for the days we were unable to stay. We will stay here again when we return to Singapore. ",5,0.8126
"My trip to Singapore was amazing. Staying at The Ibis on Bencoolen was a great recommendation by my agent. 7 Eleven is next door, ATM 200 metres, Train only one block away, bus at front door to Orchard Rd, markets behind hotel. Had no problems with the lifts, food was good with great variety catering for many nationalities. Room was compact, bed very comfortable, iron &amp; ironing board provided, big window with view of city, laundry on 3rd level, staff happy to assist with a smile, taxis regularly pull up so no need to order. I am sure they have hiccups but I didnt have any on my stay.",5,0.8589
"Stayed at the Ibis in February 2017. Enjoyed our visit then and so, without a second thought, returned prior to taking another cruise from Singapore. Room was small but well designed with comfortable bed, coffee/tea maker, safe, phone. tv etc. Small, spotlessly clean bathroom with shower. Rate included a generous buffet breakfast which is suitable for both Oriental &amp; Western tastes. Good convenient location - near MRT, shopping, markets, restaurants. Compliments to all staff members we had contact with for their friendly and efficient service.",4,0.9895
"Some years since my last stay, but the Ibis Bencoolen continues to provide excellent service and value for money from a convenient location. Only a short walk to our favourite Tikka Centre, not too far from Arab Street, and with two MRT stations nearby, it is a perfect budget hotel option if you can cope with the small, but quite manageable, room size. Service from staff was first rate.",4,0.9349
"Room was very small, but the bed is okay very soft. Bathroom also very small and the shower head is very bad, insufficient water pressure Chose the room only because Accor discount sale, if full price may not choose this room",3,-0.7677
"Fuss free nice hotel, with superb location. Special shout out to housekeeping staff Ms. Amy, for her impeccable eye for details and for me, who spends life out of a suitcase, seeing those origami's made of towel, once you walk into the room, especially made by day. Thanks once again for your hospitality.",4,0.9413
all in all met expectations. Check in slow and they did not have the IT systems to know i am an Accor Live member. Room basic functional. Coffee machine without any milk. CHeck out was quicker. Typical they make you write 200 letters as if that rule adds any value. Very French,3,0.34
The location is very strategic with 2 bus haltes in front of it and walking distance 3 MRT stations  The room is very spacious for Ibis standard. The quality of the room is good.  The staff is very friendly and helpful from receptionist up to housekeeping.,5,0.8576
"Stayed here for 3 nights, and everything was as expected from Ibis. Check in &amp; check out process was quick and efficient, and the amenities and room layout are Ibis standard. The best part of this hotel is the location: surrounded by MRT, bus stops, and food places.  My only complaint is the beds in the Twin room that we stayed in is very small (90cm wide maybe?), and length-wise barely fits my 180cm friend. As I recall, the beds in the other Ibis we've stayed at (Ibis Novena) are not as small / regular sized twin beds.",4,0.8126
"Booked four nights at start of trip to SE Asia (regular Ibis customer) and wasn't disappointed. Had everything that made for a great stay: good price, fantastic location on MRT and bus routes, very quiet (13th floor), super clean, uber-comfortable twin beds, great/cheap in-house launderette. My only complaint was that the room looked a bit tired overall, though apparently Ibis is about to undertake a major refurbishment of the building.",5,0.9398
"The hotel is conveniently located, within 5 minute walk of 3 MRT stations. While the room cannot consider big, it has sufficient space to move and for baggage. The overall cleanliness is good. My package includes breakfast. There are different choice of food.",4,0.4404
"Stayed 3 nights in Ibis On Bencoolen. It is in a great location with shopping and great eateries within walking distance.  The front office accord friendly and helpful service. We felt welcomed on check in and check out. But rather disappointed that no effort was given to assign the room we requested for!?  The housekeeping maids did a great job, the room was super clean and the bed was the best we have ever slept in.  The restaurant manager and male waiters/bar tenders were great. However a young waitress was somewhat rude and curt with a mean attitude.  It was a good stay nevertheless and most certainly will return to stay again.",4,0.9883
"My school stayed in IBIS Hotel in November of 2019 for an international conference that we attended. We actually never stayed in IBIS before and this is the first time we stayed in the hotel. First and foremost, the rooms were great. Somewhat small but decent sized rooms, with ample usual amenities such as coat hangers, ironing board, a desk, outlets, hotel phone and bottled water and everything else in between. The beds were comfortable just like any other hotel bed and allowed me to have a full night rest. The AC in the room was great as well. And every time our room got cleaned, it was done very well.   The bathrooms in the room were great as well, spacious, there was hot water and water pressure was perfect.  Furthermore, the WiFi in the hotel was weak at times and sometimes",5,0.9833
"We stayed here two non-consecutive nights.  Arrived from an overnight flight at hotel around 8:30am, in a room by 9:30am for which we were really grateful, thank you Ibis!  We stayed in this hotel last year as well and returned because we found the location to be pretty much perfect - near a couple of MRTs, plenty of food choices.",5,0.9367
"Average hotel with small rooms. Hotel staff are courteous, we have very limited amenities at the hotel and everything is chargeable. For a business trip. This is an ideal hotel. For family travellers.. I don't recommend it",2,0.5263
"Checkin time was 2pm, but I came here at 8am from airport and the allow us to check in instantly without any extra charge. That was awesome. I stayed into a king size bed room.Very near to Bencolen MRT. Only 15min walk to little India. Infront of hotel there is also a bus stop. Great location. Hotel service is very good. A lot of food court in 5 min walking distance. Highly recommend this hotel.",5,0.9675
Only one thing lacking in the bathroom is no toilet spray or eco-spray. House keeper is quite dilligent even the hanged towel also got changed daily so the purpose of environment friendly is not achieved,4,0.25
"We've been stayed at Ibis Bencoolen for several times. We got what we expected. Near to everywhere and walking distance to the SCSM event venue. We found many halal stall and vegetarian. Suround by Bugis, Rochor, Bencoolen and Bras Basah mrt station. Bus stop on your front door.",5,-0.4588
"Great location with very good customer service. The room is very clean with comfortable beddings. The breakfast has abundant choices and good quality.  It is value for money . Wish that the hotel can provide discounted rate to encourage longer term stay, say more than 3 days.",4,0.9767
"We were looking for a mid-budget no frills hotel in a central, convenient location in Singapore to stay several nights while waiting to catch our flight - we are frequent visitors to Singapore and have stayed in numerous places throughout the city over the years.  First off, this is a no-frills hotel, pretty much an Ibis - with a very convenient location only about 5 mins walk from Rochor MRT, and Bugis MRT just slightly further away. It is situated very close to shopping malls and lots of restaurants and food, including cheap hawker food within a few minutes' walk away. Extremely well located if you don't want to rely on taxis to get everywhere.  It is a basic hotel for tourists, who spend minimal time in the bedrooms - the room we had was small, with a double bed, but still",3,0.2699
"The room was small but the room price was economical, so cannot complain. Nearby Bugis mall where you will find plenty of women's clothing. Breakfast could be better. No-frills hotel was neat and clean. Metro station located nearby.",4,0.938
A conveniently located budget hotel with adequate facilities at a reasonable advance purchase price. OK value for Singapore where every thing is expensive. The 25 degree wine bar across the road is the best value in Singapore,4,0.9158
"Grateful we were able to access our room before the usual 2pm as cruise ships require early disembarkation.  No locality information was provided at check in - we had to rely on maps found on a stand. We learned from other guests (in the elevator!) that there were interesting markets, temples and shopping areas in walking distance to the hotel. The room was tiny with very little storage space or room to open suitcases other than on the bed. Room and bathroom were very clean - housekeeping full marks.",3,0.7773
"Spent 4 days and 3 nights here with my wife, room was a bit small but just enough to comfortably fit us and our luggages, room was clean, bathroom was small but clean too, had the buffet breakfast option, food was the normal breakfast stuff but was really good, location by the way was great, 1 block away from Bugis junction... Will stay here again if given the chance. ",5,0.9726
"It was my best 6 days 5 nights experience in Ibis Singapore on Bencoolen. Because the distance to Bencoolen MRT so close. Then, we can go to Bugis district with footsteps. The breakfast nice, the staff nice, the cleanliness so clean, the room is cleaned up everyday. So wonderful!",5,0.9557
first up i'm in a wheelchair we [my wife and i] had booked a room with benefits[a free phone a min bar free]    we were in formed the ibis dose not do this anymore so we settled on a free breakfast every morning which was the best  but be careful they are still advertising it we needed a wheelchair room and they only had one with a single bed in it  there had been no communication with us and we had booked our room 5 months out but that aside the new manger went out of her way to help once we got over this we had a lovely stay friendly staff  good food i would not hesitate to recommend this hotel as a stay             ,4,0.97
"I recently stayed for 7 nights at the Ibis Bencoolen Hotel.  The hotel location is fantastic.  So close to the Bugis and Rochor MRTs, to Albert Street Hawker Centre, Bugis St shopping and also to the Sri Krishnan and Kuan Yin Thong Hood temples.  I was able to go and pray at the temples every morning and I felt very much at peace.  In terms of my room, it was rather small but perfectly adequate and I love the wooden floor covering.  Other hotels should probably follow suit than the usual carpet covering which I feel is unhygienic.  Breakfast at the hotel had quite a variety and more than adequate.  I had no major gripes about it.  All in all, fantastic value for money in every aspect.  Thanks to all the staff at Ibis for a very smooth and enjoyable stay.  ",4,0.989
"I booked this hotel at a really competitive rate through MMT. Booking this hotel was a really good decision as I enjoyed my stay here. The staff was just so courteous and sweet.

"Stayed there for a very short 1 night visit. Though nicely situated, close and within walking distance to Bugis, the room is very, very small.

A nightmare. - AC is blocked and too hot for sleeping - Bed are bad quality (2 cm mattress) - Restaurant is too small for breakfast - You wait for 5 minutes to be seated for dinning - No water bootle  - The EZ card they gave to me was used for offense (I had big trouble with security to explain why I had this card), no excuse from the hotel  - Room are old - You sait each lift for more than 5 minutes  To conclude, never go in this hotel  ",1,-0.7761

"I had stayed in the property for 5 nights with my family comprising of 2 kids.  Considering 'IBIS' brand, my high expectations were met.  The hotel property was clean and the rooms were cleaned every day. The room size was small, but considering Singapore standards, it was decent. The hotel staff were very courtious and went out of the way to accommodate my early check-in request. Further, they guided me every well, on how to reach the tourist spots.  The most positive thing of the property is its central location. Most of the tourist spots were within a radius of 10-15 minutes drive. I had absolutely no trouble, in explaining my hotel location, to any of the cab drivers.  Breakfast was good with a variety of options like Indian, Japanese, Korean and continental.

"A huge hotel, nicely located between MRT stations. Nice staff. The room had a strong chemical smell and it wasn't easy to get rid off it but the bed was comfortable and for 1 night it was sufficient. Location and price are main reasons to choose this Ibis.",4,0.8554
"The hotel is not central but only a ten minute walk away from the MRT which is then a ten minute ride to the city centre.  There is also a free shuttle for some of the day.  This may explain the lower price but might also explain why I had to wait for an airport shuttle (or I may have been unlucky).  I travelled back to the airport by subway which was fine.  The hotel itself was perfectly ok - your typical Ibis with clean rooms, everything you need but not much storage space.  It is really a bolt hole - basic but if perfectly adequate if you want a cheap base to explore Singapore for a few days.",4,0.979
"Very convenient location in the middle of 3 train stations including Bugis and Rochor.  Positives: - Room was a decent size --Rooms were well sound proofed - Room and bathroom were clean  - Staff were professional - Laundromat in the hotel was very convenient, prices weren't exorbitant, and there was more than one dryer and washer  Negatives:  - The in-room fridge was very very small - One of the lifts were under repair for the whole time we stayed there",4,0.802
"Situated on a very cool Bencoolen Street, I was mightily impressed with how well situated this fantastic hotel is.  Price is extremely competitive and will not break the bank.  Should I re-visit in the future I will stay here",4,0.9079
"I was in Singapore for business and book the hotel without knowing if it is a right spot. But it turned out to be the perfect place for my business trip. what I like the most is the access to MRT, easy and convinent to go to any place you wish during your stay. Nearby is market where one can eat. the breakfast is another wonder. A true flavours of Singapore one can taste. I enjoyed my stayand met my requirement. ",5,0.9509

My wife and I have just spent a visit to Singapore and stayed in the ibis Bencoolen Hotel for five nights and found everything was excellent. We arrived at 7pm and there was a room waiting for us that was lovely and cool considering the outside temperature. The breakfast choice was also excellent with a choice from around the world to suit anyone. The staff were friendly and from our experience were very helpful when asked a question of where to visit or the best way to get there. The room was cleaned every day and was spotless. All my wife and I want is a room with breakfast with no frills with a central location  and this hotel gave us that with a bit more.,5,0.9722
"Stayed here for three nights. Arrived early but as they had a room ready they let us check in, which was a great start. Lovely big room, plenty of space, clean. All the staff we spoke to were lovely and very helpful. Breakfast was very good, a nice mix of European and Asian foods. Great location for all we wanted to do, but we do enjoy walking. I think this represented good value for money in Singapore.",5,0.9955
"This is by far one of the best breakfast spread I have had in all my hotel stays in different places.  Kudos to the cooks, kitchen hands and management for this.  Also the hotel is centrally located with ease of transportation and other places of interest nearby.  However, I must state the rooms are a bit of a squeeze",4,0.9186
"This hotel is in a great location in Singapore. Our room was clean, comfortable and large enough for us as we were out most of the day and evening. Staff were welcoming and friendly. It was great value for the price paid. One of its greatest features is its location. It was close to a number of MRT stations - we used Bencoolen and Bugis to get to a lot of the top tourist attractions of Singapore. Near the hotel were two temples with market stalls lining several blocks. These included clothing, fruit and flower sellers etc. It appeared that the locals were shopping there. The Albert Food Market was a block away, with a great variety of food stalls at cheap prices. We looked for the vendors who had queues and bought food from them. Many still cooked traditional family recipes. The",4,0.985
"Very happy with our two night stay at this Hotel.  Check in was a breeze.  Amazingly friendly and helpful staff.  The breakfast was good, although crowded.  The restaurant had a good selection and everything tasted really good.  The location was great, close to markets, shopping and restaurants as well as the Museum and Park.",4,0.9762
"Everything is good except for one thing the interior design of the room and toilet is exactly same as Sunway hospital. From the toilet, the door, the cupboard, the tv, the colour behind the tv board, the table including the logo of red white. It gave me a scary feeling as I stayed in the hospital couple of days last year, it’s a scary feeling. Why would such an established brand Le accor member wants to copy an entire concept of sunway hospital patient room. Others are all good.. friendly services from front office staff even though they are new. Lots of westerners, lift is good so far. ya",3,0.5574
"Had an unforgettable stay on Saturday, Sep 28. We were there to celebrate our 24th Wedding Anniversary and was surprised by the lovely gesture of the management. Thank you very much to the GM, Jessica and Vicky for the wine and card.  Room was clean and simple. Can't seem to find any fault with the hotel. Location is very convenient and staffs are friendly. Will definitely be back.",5,0.9501
"Stayed here for the Grand Prix weekend. Room as you’d expect with an Ibis, clean and comfortable, and serviced efficiently even though I was in most of the morning. Great location - easy walk to the track and other sites, and MRT stations a few minutes away. As others note, the breakfast area is too small and it gets crowded, but staff do their best and I found the buffet to be a decent selection.   I paid the “extra benefits” rate. The advertised smartphone is no longer supplied, even though it is still prominently advertised online and in the hotel. The free minibar consists of just two cans of soda, a small chocolate bar and a small bag of mixed nuts snack. Not even a small beer. Not worth paying extra, frankly, unless you want to use an off-site gym.",4,0.936
"A little overdue but my husband and I had our solemnisation at this hotel on the 19 August 2019. We would like to specially thank Mr Syed Ubhaidilla and his team for their efforts to make it a memorable one. Mr Syed helped us dearly with the organisation from start to finish, provided ideas and reassured us that anything is possible. We would like to extend our heartful thanks for his help and commend him for his professionalism and willingness to help us make the event a special one.",5,0.9906
"Excellent location.  You have a bus stop right in front of the hotel, MRT's 5 mins away. Property is very clean, room/lobby typical IBIS, decent breakfast, friendly staff (except front desk, felt like they are way over worked. There's always a line for them). Overall happy with the stay barring couple of things. AC broker down on last night and it took 4hrs to get it fixed (kept calling front desk every 45mins answer was always we are working on it, should be fine soon). Cell phone included in extra benefits was not given as the network doesn't work anymore, not sure why they still kept advertising with cell phone inclusion. Fourth lift was still non functional",4,0.9463
"ibis Bencoolen is in the middle of Bugis and walking distance to some of the best food &amp; sights in Singapore.  As an Accor Silver member I was very pleased with the service. I arrived early in the morning and very pleasantly surprised that I was already able to check-in. After a long flight, this is just amazing and I really appreciated this service!",4,0.9668
"Hotel ideally located for 3 MRT stations meaning that you can get around the city easily. Room, small and functional but did the trick. Its an Ibis, what more do you expect?. Breakfast was a bit manic, but plenty of varieties to eat. Staff friendly and helpful. Stayed in Bencoolen 3 times now and this is the only hotel I would go back to.",4,0.8834
"We stayed for 4 nights. Room and ensuite were very small but that was not a problem. We spent little time in the room. cleanliness is my main concern and I found two dark hairs on my bedside table and small piece of plastic debris under the bed which was disappointing. The position of the hotel was great and public transport good. Buffet breakfast was on promotion for 14SD so we tried it and was suitably impressed for the price so we ate there each morning. Reception staff were very friendly and helpful. What an excellent idea, providing us with glass drinking bottles, refillable at the bar with flat or sparkling water. Great idea to reduce plastic so well done Ibis. We thought the Ibis was good value and were pleased with our choice.",4,0.9946
"This hotel is very conveniently located in the center with 2 MRT stations just nearby. Rooms are ok, though quite small. Big problem was the breakfast: horrible. First, the food was quite bad. But on top of that, there was nothing to eat!!! It was only 9:15 am and almost everything in the buffet was empty. For example, no more cheese. I asked a waiter if they could bring more. After 5 minutes waiting, nothing, and the waiter had disappeared. I asked again a lady who explained that they would not add more because the service will end at 10am. But it was only 9:20am!!! I insisted again, spoke (almost had to beg) to the manager and they finally brought me 2 small pieces of cheese in a small plate. 15 minutes for that!!!",1,-0.9235
"My team stayed for 6 days at IBIS Bencoolen and immediately we were assisted by Priority front desk. They upgraded our rooms and the concierge was helpful in bringing up our luggages. Very good front desk service. The room though needs improvement as the aircon is not that cold, the bar was not stocked and the soap in the shower is not refilled. The breakfast service needs improvement since the 2 out the 6 days, some of the breakfast items are not brought out (e.g. eggs, bacon). Overall though the stay was pleasant and the location is perfect!",4,0.96
The hotel is located at an excellent location where you have the MTR very near and that makes your going around very easy. We had booked the King room with extra benefits. Comfortable bed for 2 adults and a child  The room size is like any other ibis around the world but was ok for us as we were going to be out all day. We arrived early and were given an early check in . Kishant made this process quick and hassle free as we were tired after travelling through the night with our toddler Kishant was very helpful through the stay.  Breakfast was good but very repetative. So got boring after 3-4 days.  But the good part is it starts right at 4 am and is there till as late as 12pm So although you may not get the full spread at all times something will be available for sure.  The,5,0.9718
"Stayed for business. Didn't expect much for the price but the a/c went out for an hour at 1am on my second night which really irritated me coz I ended up losing sleep over it and was unproductive for my meeting next day. The manager however personally came up to my room to apologize for the inconvenience and offered a complimentary buffet lunch next day. The elevaors in this property were very slow. Expect long waits, and for some reason they would always stop a random floors making the which was very annoying. Rooms are tiny but you get what you paid for!",2,-0.929
"My room was clean, well serviced and comfortable. Breakfast was very good but busy unless you go very early. Public transport is excellent with bus stops right outside and Bugis MRT station a short walk away. There are a number of eateries nearby and mini markets.",4,0.8819
Great location for those who wish to shop for loves shopping and food.  Staff is friendly and eager to help and that is great customer service.  Rooms are smaller than I expected but they are clean.  If I have to grade this hotel it would be a low B.  Staff B+  Thank you.,3,0.9446
"Stopped here a lot in the past, but definitely deteriorating. Check in can be a ordeal. There is a Accor member chk in desk, but I never seen it manned even though we checked in several times recently. Queueing to chk in a pain if group in front of you. Lifts were problematic. One always out of order, another would not go past floor No. 8. Another cancelled your floor choice at every floor stop, so had to keep reentering, awkward when everybody in lift trying to do at same time before missing there floor. We were refused water bottles, non left, though posters everywhere encourage the use of them from an environmental point of view, was available following morning. 4 of us wanted to use the 4 bamboo bikes that are available for guest, but we could not as one had a flat tyre.",4,-0.9366

"I chose to stay here because of the location and room rate was not so expensive for us. I could get the room very early at 11 am even the hotel was very busy at that time. The staff at reception was very nice. She provided us the connecting room as we requested. Special thanks to Mr. Jimmy, Singaporean staff but he can speak Thai very well. he explained everything deeply and very detailed! Always helpful and smile all the time since first day too the least day of us in Singapore.   The hotel location is located nearby 2 MRT (Rochor and Bugis). It's no too closed but  we could walk easily. We could ask for taxi to go anywhere with not too expensive fee as hotel is located in the the center. There is 7-11 at downstairs and 2 famous temples behind the hotel where we can walk to.",4,0.942
"I stayed here with my wife on our annual vacation. I had booked for 5 nights, I would say its location was the best thing as it's in the center of the city &amp; just near the hotel, there is metro as well as bus station.  Service : 3.5 / 5  This one is a commercial Ibis property, its services were above average. Lift was always full &amp; breakfast time was an issue as they could not accommodate the crowd during peak breakfast hours &amp; many have to wait to sit on table. They also have free bicycle service  for their in house guests, we tried but the bicycle were not in good condition &amp; needed a repair.  Breakfast : 2 / 5  Their spread during breakfast was below average. Varieties were good but taste was average. All 5 days almost same menu. All together we were not much satisfied by",4,-0.6015
"Taking into account that prices in Singapor are high compare with the rest of Asia, Ibis has a convenient price for what you get. 2 beds bedroom are bigger and easy 5o move around than 1 bed. It is clean, you have your kettle, coffee, ... everything you need but in a little space. It is a crowded hotel but elevator do not take too long for the amount of people around and staff are nice. The best thing about it is how well it is place, littel India and Arab street 10 min walk max, a great temple just behind, bugis shopping 2 minutes away ... If you are going to move around and do not spend too much time in the room, It is a great place to stay!!!",3,0.9836

Check in process very smooth and good. I get room at 14th floor. The room really clean and comfortable bed and linen. The room facilities was good any refrigerator, iron and board also. Only 5 minutes walking from bugis station. I am happy and will come back again to this hotel.",5,0.9581
"I stayed here for 4 days, enjoyed the room, restaurant, and close the everything. I did not realize that if you want to add breakfast later, even if you don't eat, but you have to pay for your entire staying. It was mistake probably my part, by thinking that i will be paying only for the days i use. So end up paying for 4 days, even though i did not use it.  But overall, a nice and comfortable hotel, friendly staffs, and good clean room. Will stay again.",5,0.961

Ibis is located very strategically in the center of the town. The MRT stations are not far away and shopping mall is around the corner. The hotel staff is perfect. The service was really pleasant too! I'm rating 5 stars because of the service,5,0.8217
"The location is excellent and very accessible with both Bugis and Bencoolen MRT stations within walking distance. Shopping centers and food court are just nearby and conveniently located. 7-11 shop was just adjacent and public bus stop was directly in front of the hotel. Though room size was rather compact, everything you needed for a comfortable stay were there, and the room was spotlessly clean. Good Wifi and acceptable breakfast given the price we were paying for. I would come back if I do come to Singapore again.",5,0.9136

"We stayed here for two nights and found it to be great.  The room was clean and the toiletries were good.  Breakfast was amazing in it’s range, absolutely huge and catering for a range of different cultures giving me the opportunity to try new things.  The hotel is close to Bugis markets so we were able to walk around the markets during our stay.  There were shopping centres near by if that’s your thing.  We were able to walk to the tourist info centre to catch the hop on, hop off bus which took us to all of the tourist places.  It was also walking distance from Fort Canning Park and there was a 7-11 store in the building.  All up, it had everything we needed and we enjoyed our stay here.",5,0.9738
"We checked in for a weekend stay in Singapore at this hotel. The location is nice, close to the Bencoolen MRT station. Take Exit A, turn right, and walk a bit ahead. The lobby is spacious and has plenty of lounging space. There are quite a number of other hotels in the area.  The room, however, is a bit too small. The shower is weak. It's better if the breakfast menu focusses only on a few dishes but go deeper. It has western, Japanese, local, and other dishes but each doesn't have adequate varieties.  Location is perhaps the only plus point for this hotel in our opinion.",3,0.0638
"The location of the hotel is very good, you can easily commute to different area. The staff are friendly and hospitable. The free ""handy"" mobile phone with internet is so practical for travelers, they loan it to you and you can use it as a personal hot spot, and can you can call to different major countries (certain countries) for free, sadly Philippines is not included on the list.  Checking in and Checking out was fast I would recommend this hotel if you just need to sleep and rest for awhile, it is practical, but if you will stay for a long time inside a hotel, the room might be too small for some tourist, I am Asian, so the room fits us well.",5,0.8656
"The service in the front desk check-in is atrocious.

Overall, quite a value for money deal as a tourist hotel ",4,0.9272
