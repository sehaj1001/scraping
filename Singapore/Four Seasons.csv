"Always my go-to option for staycation due to its location (I love hitting the bar during happy hour, enjoying house brew and the river view) but this time is a little different staycation than usual. I came because my travel plan got cancelled. It’s rather quiet during this period but that’s somewhat better because I got more personalized assistance and care from the staffs. Amrul (or Amirul?) on front desk has been kind and upgraded my room. I got 18th floor, the view is much better than my apartment and that’s exactly what I needed, a change of view after many weeks working from home. The staffs at Eatery resto are also nice and spent time to have quick chat with me. I really appreciate the warm gesture especially during this stay. Guess I’ll see myself back here during Easter",5,0.9846
"I am picky about giving out five stars, and I probably would have given them five stars apart from one thing: I simply didn't stay here long enough to try everything and enjoy it.  So it is a solid four!  I checked in late and things went smoothly.  My suite was perfect with a good view.  I walked around the hotel, looking around and was impressed with what I saw.  In the morning, I had breakfast and the service was good as was the food.  I have absolutely no complaints and I look forward to staying here again.",4,0.9311
"The location of Four Seasons Hotel is actually really good, it’s convenient for food and shopping. As for breakfast, you can with eat out or dine at the hotel. The breakfast at the hotel is delicious. The hotel supplies at Four Seasons Hotel are L'occitane drops. The variety is very good. The service is particularly good, definitely a family friendly hotel for sure! ",5,0.9684
"The Four Seasons in Singapore is an older property.  The style of the building, the shape of rooms, etc are all from the 80'.   The service is the usual from FS, ie; very good. The only downside was arriving from a 25 hour flight, only to find the hotel bar closing early (basically in our face). They really should rethink this. A lot of the clientele arrive late at night and having a glass of wine would have been appreciated.  The roof top pool is very clean, but lacks charm. A few chaise longue, few plants and that's it.   The absolute best part of the hotel is breakfast. It is the BEST breakfast buffet I have experience in the world. No words can do it justice.   Lastly, note that hotel is not downtown. It's further north, in a nice shopping area. But you're not at all where",3,0.9832
"Service is awesome, highly recommend. Very detailed and very attentive. We have a 3 year old daughter with us, and everyone was very accommodating, from offering stroller for us to use, opening doors for us and opening elevators for us as our daughter is napping, from extending our check out to accommodate one more nap. Breakfast service was amazing, remembered our preferences, including tea options. Pool service was great. Room was wonderful and clean and housekeeping done twice a day with no issues. Tent was also given as play for our daughter, with balloons and treats as welcome. Our daughter loved it. Thank you Four Seasons!!",5,0.9854
"Stayed for three nights together with my wife. Both agreed it’s the best hotel experience of our lives. Hotel is high end, and the staff are all professional and super helpful.  Rooms are great, with a really comfortable bed. Bathrooms are modern.  Breakfast we enjoyed very much, and had recommended local dish each day.  Location is great for Orchard road shopping, and it a short taxi ride to Clarke Quay, Boat Quay and other attractions.  A lot of choice in Singapore. We are so happy we chose the Four Seasons and will definitely be back. ",5,0.9907
"First time for Four Seasons SG. The location is great, not far from Orchard. The room reminds me of Four Seasons HK, the layout is quite the same.  The bed is comfortable but the thing i dislike is the air-condition. It is quite hot. Although I try to adjust it to the lowest 19C, it is still not cool enough (That trip I stay at Ritz and Raffles before Four Seasons, so I know that it is not the degree I wanted it to be).  And the room has some smell, it is not bad smell, bit it is not fresh.  The reception I met, Miku, she is the best of the best. Her attitude and her hospitality made me give the 5 stars rating to the hotel despite the comment I gave about the room.  The another thing I really like is the staff and the quality of your Michelin Chinese restaurant. Everything is",5,0.9334
This feels like a top notch hotel. Dealing with the front desk and the concierge was super easy. The concierge understood what we asked for and got us what we were looking for.  We got an upgrade on the room and got a room that seemed to have been very recently refurbished. Nicely decorated and comfortable. The only drawback was a quite poor hairdryer and the make-up mirror seemed to have been left over since before the refurbishment.  We did not have breakfast at the hotel.  The gym seemed to be brand new but the changing rooms in particular the gents seemed a bit old.  This was my first experience with a Four Seasons hotel and I will be sure to be looking out for a Four Seasons hotel on future trips.,5,0.8603
We only spend one night but the service and the very nice staff we meet were of the highest quality and made us want to come back next time we are in singapore.  The room was new and stylish.  We also had a great meal in the restaurant and I was very happy with the selection and quality of the wine by the glass.,5,0.9567
"This is my birthday trip &amp; my first time visiting Singapore and I must say that I didn't choose wrong to choose Four Seasons for my stay! Four Seasons really treat me very well, surprise me with a cake on my birthday &amp; I can blow a candle this year! (tbh I'm kinda worried because of, it quite sad that I can't blow a candle this year). And also Miku really assisting me &amp; my partner really well from the first day of our stay until arranging the birthday cake! It means a lot to me! :) And also they have a Chat App for guests to get connected with the Guest Services, so you can order in-room dining, ask, or request anything very easily through their chat app! it is very convenient! Thank you Four Seasons Singapore! :)",5,0.9587
"We had the pleasure to stay here for 3 nights..A Beautiful Hotel...Great Food and Service, Beautiful Appointed Rooms, Lovely Pool and Spa Area. The Buffet Breakfast is amazing. A must is the Cocktail Bar for a before or after Dinner Cocktail, lovely spot..Great Staff at this Hotel and just a stones throw walk to Orchard Road. Look forward to visiting again.",5,0.9747
"We stayed here for 2 nights for our honeymoon before flying onto Thailand. The Four Seasons is 30 mins from the airport and upon arrival we were warmly greeted and upgraded to a larger suite for free. When we got there we were welcomed with a card, chocolate strawberries, rose petals in the bath and a hand written Happy Honeymoon note on the window! The hotel itself is so beautiful and our suite was stunning. The bed oh my word.... it was like sleeping on a bed of marshmallow angels covered in caramel and we seriously are considering purchasing the pillows.   We did not opt for breakfast as it was something like 45 USD pp! We did however take advantage of the free nibbles in the bar area from 5:30-6:30pm with an amazing cocktail. We ate at the Michelin star Jiang-Nan Chun",5,0.9891
"The four seasons know what's important. Luxery Bedding, Good Food c/w a full range of amenities. The hotel might be considered a little out of the way to some. There is a large luxury mall 5 to 10 minutes walk from the mall. Taxis are reasonable in Singapore and you rarely wait more than a minute.",5,0.5719
"We visited Singapore to celebrate my daughter’s and husband’s double birthday. As we always prefer to stay at Four Seasons, we booked here. Their concept of hospitality is miles ahead every other brand. We were given an amazing room at the 18th floor and when we arrived everything was ready without even requesting for an early check in- the hotel was full due to Chinese New Year (early check in at 12:30pm). A great surprise was there for the birthday people as well (check fotos attached). The view was amazing, the bathroom was amazing, the ambience was fresh and clean.  Breakfast was complete and I still cannot forget those divine cranberry muffins. We also had dinner at One Ninety once. The food was good but what I have to say is that we ordered plain kids spaghetti with",5,0.941
"each and every member of the staff we encountered ensured we were taken care of and did so with a smile. if i had an option, i would stay at a four seasons in every city we travel to. the location was perfect for us to go do tourist things as well as to quietly relax in a very quiet and serene location.",5,0.9512
"Our stay here would have gone extremely well had it not been for the receptionist who tried to give us any room and not to our request when we first checked in. He tried to convince us that he had no available rooms at high floors as we requested but after an hour of discussions "" he found one"" and it was excellent.",4,0.7681
"From the greeter who met us at the airport and the driver who drove us from there--seamless entry on our first trip to Singapore. Everyone at breakfasts and dinner at One Ninety so friendly. Excellent food at all meals. Breakfast buffet rates at the top of our international 5 star hotel list. We loved our suite #1007. Spacious. Great view. Love the bathroom. Bed and bedding SOOOO comfortable. We were there for a birthday (it was acknowledged with a cake to the suite, and cake at breakfasts and dinner). Chines New Year Lion Dance well done and a lot of fun. VIP service. Concierges were great; helpful with every request. Front desk friendly at checkin and departure. We will return!",5,0.9932
A wonderful experience with top service. The housekeeping staff giving me a mouse mat off their own bat when they noticed I was using a laptop was exemplary proactive service by a hotel that clearly prides itself on taking the best possible care of its clientele.,5,0.9628
"Four Seasons Singapore is the perfect combination of a top class hotel with all amenities for business and leisure, yet is still able to retain a very personalised service, creating a sense of homely luxury.",5,0.7884
Began 2020 in Singapore with the very friendly staff from the 4 seasons who really made the stay memorable for both myself and my wife. First class service and such an atmosphere of caring and helping. We will definitely be back! ,5,0.8976
We stayed here two night and had a great stay. We ate dinner and it was delicious. The breakfast buffet was also great. Bed was super comfortable and would recommend this hotel. Great location and good service.,5,0.9828
"Staff were helpful via email before arrival as I had many questions re accessibility of smoking areas, allergies to feathers, etc. Checkin was efficient and painless!  The room was small but clean and comfortable. Staff were genuinely friendly, responsive  and polite throughout the stay  I would recommend hotel",4,0.9735
"everything is perfect...big pool super clean rooms big sofa lovely breakfast time  ..the pool is so clean it's crystal clear i love it ..room decoration was awesome decoration, lighting and friendly staff..they smile everytime ",5,0.9829
"Staying at a few different Four seasons I guess I've come to realize they're just so consistently great, this one was no different. From check in to breakfast to housekeeping, just well done. Loved the rooftop pool as well the pool on the 3rd floor. Great location on Orchard Blvd in a really beautiful area of Singapore. i split my visit to Singapore between the Four Seasons and the Marina Bay Sands. Lets just say I preferred the Four Seasons.",5,0.9616
"From the toys given to my children at check in, to the nappies (correct size) baby products and plentiful complimentary bottled water, no detail was too small for this hotel.  The kids loved the pool (floaties provided), the staff couldn’t be more helpful. Fruit on the club level was fantastic. Complimentary biscuits and sweets for the kids each day.  Location was terrific. Rooms were spacious. Can’t rate highly enough!",5,0.9674
"This was a really great experience. The staff looked after us from the moment we arrived, very early in the morning from a long flight. They provided us with tea and we were able to swim while we waited for a room. The room itself was lovely and the breakfast in the hotel provided almost everything you could want. The best thing about this hotel however was the staff who really went out of their way to be helpful.  We are really looking forward to our next visit.",5,0.9476
"My family and I spent 4 nights at the Four Seasons at the end of a trip to SE Asia and I cannot say enough good things about this property. The staff were extremely helpful and accommodating and really went above and beyond - the cleaning staff did an especially standout job and went so far as to leave personalized notes for each person in my group - I was left a bookmark for a book I’d left open and a friend’s sunglasses were cleaned for her! Rooms are spacious, comfortable and functional, food is delicious and room service was nice enough to serve us breakfast in the evening upon request! Will absolutely return to this property on my next trip to Singapore!",5,0.9035
"Great, great, great hotel.  Fantastic and consistent quality of facilities and service throughout the hotel and great location.  Room was spot on and the service was impeccable from the doorman through to the attendant at the rooftop pool.  A high quality, classy and understated hotel - so if you are looking for a refined and infused experience this is the place to stay.  We have stayed 4 nights and wish we were here longer.  The spa, gym and club house facilities are to the expected high standards as are the rooms and restaurants.  Thank you Four Seasons!",5,0.9824
Stayed with my wife and family in October this year. I had stayed at this hotel several times during business trips and decided to have a seven day holiday in Singapore with family. We were not disappointed in the hotel as everything was first class from check in to check out. The staff are fabulous and nothing is a problem. The rooms are first class and the location of the hotel in relation to Orchard Road is great. We will return in 2020 Mr Stewart Davis Glasgow Scotland,5,0.9327
"The Four Seasons has been one of our two go-to hotels in Singapore for over six years and we are in the city multiple times each year, most recently this November.   The location is perfect for our needs, near Orchard Road but removed enough to be a quiet oasis.  The hotel is small and peaceful.   Our favorite features are 1) a very strong gym and two pools - one adults only (thank you!) located at the gym and one for all ages on the roof; 2) excellent Food and Beverage.   Evening room service is above and beyond, the restaurant breakfast is excellent.  It’s a buffet but of a much higher quality than any other hotel in Singapore and more peaceful; 3) the hotel looks much better after a recent renovation.   The rooms finally have decent TV’s and a much needed refresh.   If we had",5,0.9892
"We have been travelling from the US to Bangkok to Singapore. We chose this property based on pricing, ratings and location.  I can say that we are not disappointed.  We booked two adjoining rooms which worked well for us. We stayed for several days, using this as a take off point. Given our location we did not have to contend with any blockages or barriers as we prepared for New Year  celbrations as some properties did closer to the waterfront.   Since our flight is leaving around midnight local time on our last day we consolidated to one room so we could clean up after wandering for the day and before boarding the flight.   The staff from the front desk though the cleaning crew have been friendly and helpful.  The facility is clean and efficent.  I would stay here again.",5,0.9463

It is what you would expect of Four Seasons. The location is suited for shopping as it is a few steps off Orchard Rd. It has good restaurants. I liked the Chinese best. As for the views do not expect much otherwise you will be dissapointed. You will be looking at other buildings. ,5,0.872
"From start to end of our staycation your staff have been absolutely gracious and professional in ensuring our stay was an unforgettable one. It felt like we were meeting old friends again.  I wasn't feeling well and requested for warm water but a staff (I wish I knew her name) from the one-ninety bar very kindly suggested and offered me hot lemon tea with honey instead.  Eddric Yang, our banquet manager is a gift to your hotel. His sincerity for those under his care is truly astounding. Who knew that after our wedding we would leave the hotel having forged a new friendship.   We were curious about the history of the hotel, and to our surprise, Eddric was very knowledgeable on the topic. When Eddric heard it was our anniversary, he went out of his way to make our staycation feel",5,0.9904
"This is a great hotel pretty much on Orchard road (down a side street). Hotel was beautifully presented for Christmas and the guest rooms were very clean. Guest bathroom also had a luxury feeling to, which some 5 star hotels can lack. Bed was big a comfortable. Good electronics (digital aircon switch, electric blinds etc), arrival cookies. Maybe air conditioning was a bit cold on arrival, but you can alter that once you are in. Overall would stay again. Have stayed in many 5 star hotels over the years and this was definitely worth the spend. Much better than the Hilton around the corner - which I stayed in earlier during the week &amp; is a bit dated considering the money you pay for it. ",5,0.9574
Reception staff are amazing and very professional. The lighting in the room is very dim specially on the evening. A friend told us that every day fruits are brought to their room but unfortunately for us this happened only on the first day. The pool need a heating system.,5,0.1027

"This hotel is easy to get to and located just off Orchard Road making it quiet and relaxing. All the staff are friendly and welcoming. There is a walk way from the hotel to a small mall and then down to the Hilton which is on the main Orchard Road and then all shops, restaurants, bus routes etc are clearly accessible. They allowed us to check in early at 10:30am and check out late at 3pm. Rooms are spacious with a large bed and tv, coffee/ tea making facilities and large bathroom with bath and rain shower. Rooms are cleaned often. There is a rooftop pool but also an adult only pool on the 3rd floor with jacuzzi and free fruit and water. We often went there for a small breakfast before going out for the day. There are 2 restaurants but we only went to the restaurant bar for the",5,0.9081
Beautiful hotel and the one bedroom suite was extremely comfortable with quality linen and touches. The choice of restaurants is excellent and provides super variety. The only negative feedback is that room service gave me half a glass of wine (literally) which I had not noticed at the time as I was signing the bill. The pool is locked in the evenings which I found unusual and disappointing if you want a late night swim.,5,0.8588
"In a city with hotels constantly updating and renovating, it'll be hard to top this hotel's service. I became sick with the flu and a bad cold during the third night of my stay. It must have been just before 6Am when I called the concierge for help. They immediately called the gift shop so they could get pain meds and coordinated with room service to send up a hot breakfast with a pot of ginger tea with honey and lemon on the side (just how I like it). When I felt I needed to see a doctor, they made an appointment right away with a nearby clinic.  I've stayed at this hotel numerous times and I love how the staff remembers my preferences : lots of bottled water in the room, extra clothes hangers, room view and how to handle packages that I regularly receive.  The amazing Four",5,0.5859
The best service we have ever experienced. Nothing was too much to ask. The staff were perfect. The rooms were great and every detail was thought through. The hotel made the trip extremely enjoyable and recommend full heartedly. ,5,0.9581
I stayed at this hotel for 6 night's on a business visit to Singapore. A small issue happened with my room and just gave the front desk a heads-up to fix the issue and actually they upgraded my room. A special thanks to Shamus the guest relations manager for his excellent service and support during my stay. I think it was one of the best service i received overall during my travels. Again thank you Shamus and was an honor meeting you.whenever i am in Singapore again will come back to this hotel  ,5,0.9678

We had the best time at the Four Seasons in Singapore. The hotel is super central and you can reach everything very easily! The staff was amazing and the breakfast was incredible! Loved how clean and well maintained the rooms are! Would come again for sure!,5,0.9796
"We stayed in a deluxe room for 3 nights, and it was great! The bathroom is huge with a marble finish, loved the rain shower and  the room was big as well. The cookies they leave in the room was good too. I even asked house keeping to leave more, and they did.   Hotel is not along orchard road but is connected by a bridge into the Hilton which is along orchard Rd. Which for me is great at least it's quiet compared to being there by orchard Rd.   Will definetly go back to this hotel again when we are in Singapore. ",5,0.9312

"Great hotel thats been around a while. s with all the Four Season's Ive stayed in the staff are impecable.  Like the Shangri'La its a little bit out of it for busines travellers.   Other drawbacks are its well maintained but feeling a little dated vesus the competition.  Also at time of writing (November 19) it has a pretty major construction site next door that looks like it will be active for at least a year. I got a room facing away and didnt notice any noise, but it'd be worth avoiding if you can I think.  The food in the restaurants is very good even if they are a little lacking in atmosphere.",4,0.9649
"This was our second stay at this hotel and it was wonderful. The service has gotten even better and the rooms are so incredibly comfortable. Be sure to book a date with breakfast included, the buffet is really great. A couple small details really impressed us like they remembered my wife’s name, new we stayed there before, and the turndown service is great. They also didn’t charge extra for a coke like most breakfast buffets (not a coffee drinker) so I didn’t feel nickel and dimed like many other luxury hotels. We also had a great view of the city from our room. ",5,0.9898
"We stayed at the four seasons for 3 nights. Our flight got us in at 6am and therefore we arrived to the hotel about 7.45am.   They were kind enough to let us check in and offered us a discounted upgrade which we took.   The room was amazing, the staff were amazing and the hotel itself is simply amazing.   I must say my personal favourite was their chocolate milkshake. I loved it!  Thank you so much for making the start of our holiday fabulous. We will definitely be back when we come back to Singapore again.   ",5,0.9841
This is our 2nd time at this lovely hotel. Hotel staff seeing that offered us a free upgrade to a premium spacious room with bay windows on the 15th floor. They upgraded a 2nd room for our daughter &amp; son-in-law also. Gladys at the front desk and rest of the staff were absolutely fantastic. Breakfast buffet was excellent. Pool and gym were very nice as well. Orchard Road location is very convenient with easy access to shopping and dining as well as transport. We would definitely love to stay here again.

My niece and I have dietary restrictions and Thamil from the restaurant went out of his way to have special meals prepared for us in the morning.

Rooms were large and comfortable, restaurant was excellent (although this, like other good food in Singapore, tends to be pricey) but best thing was the staff.  Either Singaporeans in general are all warm and serving with a smile, or they’ve done an excellent job training them.

You have main spots walking distance and also bus and tube very close.  The room is big with all details also in the bathroom. Also the breakfast is really good. You have different kind of products and meals to choose from and the environment is really nice. I had an issue with my flight, it was delayed for 6 hours and the person in concierge help me to change the flight talking directly to the airline and managed to get another flight and connection so I could arrive home on time.

"Four Seasons brand exudes luxury and this one is no different. Classic decor public areas with spacious, functional and very well designed modern rooms. Bose soundlink iii was provided if you need to crank up your music. Staffs were excellent as well. Located at quiet spot behind Orchard, you'll need a little walk to reach the shopping belt. Only couple of minutes to get to Wheelock then you can enjoy the underground access to ION or TANG areas. The hotel also has an indoor access to Hilton that serves as an alternate route to get to main Orchard road. Will definitely return but I would skip the breakfast buffet unless it's for convenience.",5,0.7194

"I regularly stay in 5 star hotels for business however this time it was special. I’ve met plenty of GMs in my time but the Four Seasons apparently has a new GM, genuinely engaging, has a serious interest in how he and his team can improve your experience in the hotel but also in singapore. From my short stay I can also see this wasn’t a one-off I saw him regularly with guests and coaching his team to ensure his guests got the best out of their stay. My breakfast experience was simply a delight, top quality, a range of breakfast items that just seems endless and also creative. Great work Simon and team, I will be back!!!!",5,0.9916
"We loved our stay at this hotel. The room was beautiful, the service impeccable. The Four Seasons really makes a difference in service, is right above the rest! The hotel is very well maintained.  The only minus was the breakfast, that we found was below that of other 5 start hotels in Singapore like the Mandarin Oriental for example. It does detract from the ambience that the restaurant has no natural light.  Still, I would happily be back!",5,0.953
"I was going back to Singapore after almost 6 years, and naturally chose Four Seasons since my family had enjoyed staying there in 2014 as well. I am happy to report that it was every bit as good as I remembered, and even better in some ways!  Thanks to Jenny for noticing that we were using a mouse without the mouse pad, and thoughtfully giving us one even when he had not asked! Concierge services were impeccable, and staff were friendly and helpful about giving directions and advise about the best way to get to our destination. Breakfast seemed better than I remembered, and staff were good about remembering what my kids had liked the previous day and giving the same item even before we had asked. Rooms were great - clean, luxurious, comfortable, as one would expect.  I do have a",5,0.9949
my family was left out a baby stroller in the taxi when they were going to merlion park. the hotel security and the door bell were very kind to find the plate number of the taxi through cctv and called the driver to return to the hotel bringing the stroller. We finally get the stroller back and it was a great experience for us. thank you so much Four Seasons.,5,0.9184
"Breakfast buffet is nice and generous but not all the time, the guests could come down to have it due to age, mobility, health or lack of time. In my case, I had wasn't feeling well, called the frontdesk if I could just have a breakfast plate in my room. But they said that only the buffet is available. I stay in hotels often and most of them offer in-room breakfast if the guest is not able to go to the buffet. Otherwise, this hotel is clean and has good location.",3,0.6931
"Stayed at 814 for 4 nights, had a good sleep, bathrooms mirrors are so many to dress up from every angle. The cleaners always clean the room and replace every products (bathroom soaps). The breakfast buffet is my favourite 😍 would love to stay at Four Seasons Hotel again ",5,0.8689

"Impeccable service, very spacious room even at base category. The view was amazing, could see part of the Marina Bay Sands. There was however no welcome drink provided but I must thank the team for an early check-in. Very thoughtful especially the fact that everyone knew our name right at the kerb. Room cleaning and Make the bed service was outstanding. Would’ve loved few complimentary cookies/fruits everyday in room. Breakfast was a tad boring especially due to repetitive food items everyday, but the thoughtful service really covered any lacuna. The doormen were super helpful especially delivering our food orders and with our shopping bags.  Would’ve loved a remote device to control the curtains and lights. Also, the TV remote was not functioning, though we hardly used it.  A",5,0.9912
"This hotel exemplifies everything great about the best Four Seasons properties.  Every aspect of our stay was perfect - greeted on arrival with toys for the children before we'd even alighted from the car, whisked to our upgraded room for check-in, where we found heartwarming welcome notes written for my wife and the girls on the mirrors.    All staff were happy, friendly and professional and helpful.  The rooms are very fresh as they've recently completed a full refurb.  We will definitely return to the Four Seasons Singapore.",5,0.9874
"I had such a great time on my visit to the four seasons Singapore.  I arrived at 11:30am not expecting to check in but when I arrived they already had a room ready for me which was amazing! On my last day they also offered me a later checkout which was a very nice gesture.  The pool staff are amazing! Karen and Alison were so helpful, friendly, genuine and professional!! Karen remembered me everyday and was very pleasant to talk to. Hazel also gave me good recommendations for Sentosa Island.  Justine and Aruin in the restaurant were very welcoming, enthusiastic and went above and beyond to make sure I was enjoying my whole stay in singapore not only in the hotel but they were giving me lots of helpful tips about Singapore in general too   The hotel is very clean, but the",5,0.9973
"The hotel is about 2 blocks off the main shopping hub of Orchard, where you will also find plenty of restaurants and the MRT.   Rooms are large and elegant, stocked with everything you need - plenty of complimentary water, decent wifi, etc. There is a separate dressing table to apply makeup and style your hair, as well as plenty of space to sit and work aside from the bed.   The staff is very helpful at calling taxis, storing luggage, etc  The breakfast, which was includes in my rate, was an enourmous spread of food with selections from all over the world - eggs made to order, curries, fresh fruits, dumplings, etc.   Some very minor nits: the room is pretty dark, even with all the lights on and they aren’t all on one switch so you have to do a sweep of turning off all the lights",4,0.9259
The Asian chic and hospitality has mixed up at this hotel in the city center of Singapore. Most impressive are amazing details tincturing a unique look while the breakfast is must to taste. Modern interior fans better to look for other hotels.,5,0.9128

"First class service from start to finish. Possibly the best hotel staff that I've dealt with - both affable and still professional. If I was to nit pick I thought that the drinks at the bar were a bit pricey while the TV channels were pretty limited, but otherwise the whole experience was great.",5,0.872
"Fourth time in this luxury (yet affordable) hotel. It is the closest to staying in a private (luxuriously elegant!) home.  It is one of my top 10 hotels around the world. Big room, subtle lighting effects, discreet yet stylish!  And what is that fragrance wafting through the lobby? Roll on the fifth time.",5,0.3578
"What set the Four Seasons hotel apart from the rest is their extremely high level of customer service. The staff is super attentive and helpful. Location is great and within walking distance to the main shopping area. Rooms are of a very generous size and have all the amenities of a luxury hotel. Breakfast is good and contains extensive selections. Hotel isn’t the newest one in town but their superb service surely makes up for it. Overall, an excellent value for money.",5,0.9814
A friend and I checked in for one night only at the Singapore Four Seasons at the end of a holiday in Singapore.  We were both impressed we both received name acknowledgment every where we were in the hotel. The decor in the rooms was delightful and the room was very spacious. I have never experienced such personalised and attentive service that is in no way intrusive or ingratiating. I hope to be able to experience more of the Four Season brand of hospitality.,5,0.926
We suppose to stay in Oakwood for stopover but so busy we happy we stay with Four season so new to us for travel and everything here was super fun.

I still cant understand why this hotel cant be lifted to 6 star instead of a 5 STAR status. The staff will go over and beyond at all times to assist. They are Genuine and truly love working in a environment that is second to none and is evident with every conversation i have with them. I often tell friends and family pay a little extra and always stay at a four seasons hotel or resort as they do bring you the WOW factor.,5,0.9364
"I had a great stay at the Four Seasons, unfortunately too short. Service from the Staff was beyond my expectation. Every time I walked in to the Hotel there is always a staff greeting and welcoming me, from the doormen to front office and Concierge to the breakfast room.  ",5,0.802
"The Four Seasons is a name that promises a lot and in this occasion it also delivers. The hotel is located in a great spot in the middle of Singapore (Orchard Blvd), close to shopping malls, MRT and other attractions. The hotel is a luxury hotel and has all the required amenities and the rooms give you a great relaxing atmosphere and sleeping experience due to the very comfortable pillows, duvets and beds. One of the best options in Singapore for me.",4,0.9766
"We stayed here for a few days , and we don’t regret. Such a nice staff, fantastic rooms, the service; especially the concierges, the breakfast, thank you so much! And not to forget; the friendly and kind doormen:). The hotel has two different pools, sun beds, all you need! We will surely recommend this hotel as one the best options in Singapore.",5,0.9737

Four Seasons is one of the most centrally located hotels in Singapore while not being in a busy traffic area.  Staff will make you feel welcomed and at home while on business. Very pleasant amenities beautiful rooms.  Fabulous morning buffets getting you ready for a busy day.,5,0.9438
"If you are looking for the personal touch and genuine service that seems to be diminishing these days, Four Seasons Singapore is the right place for you!  I was skeptical in the beginning due to the age of the property but trust me, you will not regret it!  Oh, not to mention if you are travelling with kids, they have everything you need!  ",5,0.8259
"We booked ourselves into the basic category room overlooking the famous Orchard Road and couldn't have been more pleased with both the view and the size of the room. We had heard that accommodations in Singapore, like in Europe, tend to be on the smaller side. The beds were very comfy and it was nice having a decent sized bathroom for the room category that we were in. The hotel also has a lovely pool with some great poolside staff that make sure you are well hydrated at all times. We had a very enjoyable stay at the Four Seasons and can easily see ourselves coming back to this hotel on our next visit to Singapore",5,0.9761
"Great service. Always treated as an honored guest, with staff remembering my preferences even though I am only there a few days a year. Remodeled rooms are very spacious and comfortable.  Breakfast buffet is the best anywhere.",5,0.949
"Very helpful staff, large airy room. Adult only pool option.   We didn't eat breakfast so no idea if it's any good, but we had drinks in the bar a couple of evenings and the service was really good.   The rooftop pool is really small, I honestly think that one should be the adults one and the larger one should be for families.  The location is excellent for getting into the city and the Big Bus stops across the road.",4,0.938
"Recently I stay in FS Singapore with my friend, before I check in to the hotel my mind just telling me, “Wow, I’m staying in a luxury 5 star hotel.” Everything was so perfect during our stay and especially Alex from front office, thank you for your wonderful service and let us have a memorable stay in FS. Only one thing I would like to highlight is, maybe bellboy side can be more friendly and smile more to the guest but of course not everyone, just few person only. Overall from room to breakfast, everything was very good. Thank you FS Singapore once again :)",5,0.9766
Amazing stay - the staff were fabulous going out of there way to learn our names and went the extra mile with some other little touches. The room was beautifully appointed and had the most comfortable bed and pillows. The coffee machine in the room hit the spot each morning too!,5,0.9412
The staff- the amenities- the quality of food- were all superb.  Centrally located in Singapore- there isn't anything the property and the local didn't offer.  I highly recommend it- and couldn't think of a more pleasant and enjoyable experience.  ,5,0.8601
"Arrived SQ21 from Newark, pre-arranged car was waiting for us at Changi, Four Seasons representative called us shortly before we passed through immigration to let us know the driver was waiting. Very comfortable transfer from airport to hotel.  On arrival at hotel, a staff member escorted us to our room and conducted check-in in the room - greatly appreciated after 17 1/2 hours in premium economy seating. A plate of cupcakes was waiting for our children, along with strawberry drinks. Children's toothbrushes and toothpaste were waiting in the bathroom in our spacious and beautifully appointed 2 queen bed room.  We enjoyed a meal at Jiang-Nan Chun, which I would highly recommend.

"We have stayed in most of the luxury hotels in Singapore but this was our first time at The Four Seasons - it won’t be our last.  Fabulous room (we had a suite), exceptional service and an amazing meal at the Michelin started Chinese restaurant.  A particular call out to the concierge team who did a great job in booking various restaurants and transportation (as well as dealing with our constant changes and additions!)  We had treatments in the spa with two amazing therapists from Bali.  Our 5 nights just flew by.  Can’t wait to come back  Thanks to all of the team at the Four Seasons  ",5,0.9841
"We stayed 2 nights at this 5 stars hotel and I undoubtedly have to say that it deserves all of them.  Located on quiet tree line area on Orchard Boulevard, just around the corner from the famous Orchard Road, Singapore's retail center, where you can find from upscale boutiques to amazing department stores and lot of dining as well.  At a 5 minutes walk from the hotel you will reach the Orchard MRT Station, from there, you can ride the North South Line that allows you to connect with most of the other lines ,which makes it very convenient to go around the city.

"All of the dining options in the hotel have gluten free options available however the breakfast staff was outstanding.  On the first day I spoke with Audrey (Pastry chef) and she went out of her way to make sure each morning there were plenty of options made especially for me such as Gluten Free pancakes, French toast, fried rice, and one the last day (photographed here) Gluten Free desserts!  The fruits and fresh juices are heavenly and you can also request GF bread to accompany eggs.  The rest of the staff is extremely attentive greeting you with warm smiles.

"The Four Seasons Hotel in Singapore is absolutely wonderful. We arrived at 5am and the staff allowed us to relax on Level Three, have a snack, and use the beautiful showers to freshen up. The staff are friendly and very attentive. We had two singles and a roll away and the space still felt roomy. The bathroom is beautiful. A good location off Orchard Road with  a subway stop right around the corner. Turn down service in the evenings was very kind. A wonderful hotel for families. The staff thought we were travelling with young children (instead of twenty year old children) and left is cupcakes and kids toiletries. Will definitely stay again. ",5,0.9834

Room service needs to be upgraded- it’s lousy &amp; shabby the way they serve u, mostly with a frown. Surprisingly, this was the case in the presidential suite &amp; over 5/6 nights- so it can’t be put off as bad timing. Did write to the gm about this &amp; he replied v promptly &amp; positively. Hope they take serious cognisance. ",4,0.8834

"This is not Yo-tel, you will receive top notch service from attentive 'human' staffs. I've been coming to Spore for work+leisure since 6 years ago and stay about a week each visit. It was my first time staying with Four Seasons Spore, my choice was usually near the MBS, not Orchard. I don't think I will ever go back to the MBS area from now. I liked the slightly remote location and the fact that it was still a walking distance to malls and metro (they are all connected from Wheelock Center). I heard from a local friend that the hotel itself has been there forever but the facilities are very nicely maintained. I cannot emphasize how delicious the Peking duck and the sweet and sour pork at the Chinese restaurant is. Highly recommend to try out the resto even if you are not staying",5,0.9078

An absolutely amazing Hotel and Service from the Staff.  Everyone was attentive and generous with their time.  Rooms were the largest we have stayed in.  Everything was perfect.

A very special time spent with family.,5,0.9564

It was fresh and clean and spacious with lots of nice touches to make you feel special.  The hotel is a pleasant walk to Orchard but provides a private oasis in a very busy city.
