"Comfortable, private and clean room. Bathroom was splendid. Swimming pool was stunning. Carpark accessible but small. All day beverage was a good bonus. Wifi was fast. Room service can be better - took an hour with 3 calls to receive toiletries, with our room not made despite the Service sign up for the day. Buffet breakfast was so-so, minimal variety, not the tastiest. Overall good experience.",4,0.9735
"Hotel is located in a great position close to all amenities. Staff are helpful, very clean and good coffee is available just meters away from the hotel. I was traveling for business but will return with my family in the near future, I feel like this hotel will suit any type of  traveller. ",5,0.8683
"Stayed in this hotel with my friends and we had a virtuously remarkable experience. The level of hospitality of this hotel is topnotch and its people is their gem. To attest, one of the associates named Gian stood up; she welcomed us in the lobby and assisted straight in the registration. Her warm smile and high level of hospitality made the big difference in our arrival experience. The bellman also proactively offered luggage assistance. The entire front desk is undeniably friendly and welcoming similar to Gian.   The room is comfortable and the location of the hotel is very accessible to necessities.  Would love to return in this hotel soon.  Thank you!",5,0.9857
Went on holiday to Singapore stayed marina bay sands then Park hotel clark quay.  From arrival meeting Andy the concierge to reception  VIP Joe  who showed us different rooms my wife smokes did crystal club but stayed on smoking floor which was ideal as on 2 floor by pool. Crystal club lounge was closed but sat outside down stairs   We eat every night club food and drinks Ria who ran crystal club is a credit to your hotel .  She helped make our stay as did all crystal club staff Marco and others  Andy on the concierge desk saved our holiday helping us in multiple ways again a total credit to your hotel.  During a worldwide crisis the staff brought calm and joy .  Every person who works there contributed to making memories.  Here's hoping every one is safe  Would recommend this,5,0.99
"Stayed here  for 4 nights at end of February 2020. Comfortable hotel, nice room.  Particularly enjoyed using the swimming pool - lovely after a days sightseeing.  Very friendly and helpful staff.  Good location for sightseeing in Singapore, close to Clarke Quay but not in i,t so hotel quiet but with short stroll to bars and restaurants.  Close to choice of Underground stations for exploring other areas of Singapore.   Recommended location for those wanting  a central location to explore Singapore.",5,0.9213
"My wife and I had such a happy time at Porta. It's our third time there and it is good every time so I felt I have to give this review.   Their sea bass is always excellent, fresh and tasty. Fried Oyster too!  Not to mention, Desiree served our table and we had a wonderful experience with her.  Thumbs up!",5,0.9508
"Stayed 5 nights at this hotel as a couple. Nicely situated for easy access to all the sights in Singapore. Close to a subway station on the downtown line. The hotel is very well appointed with a bar and restaurant and a lovely pool with a bar as well. Free pool towels. We were room only so didn't use the main restaurant. Excellent service , very clean throughout, comfy beds and flat screen TV. Safe and minibar in the room. Good bathroom with two showers. Safe to drink water from the taps.",5,0.985

We stayed here for 4 nights at February/March.  The staff where brilliant with my mum who has difficulty walking. We had a pool day to get over jet lag around the great pool.  I look hope to go back when the world is normal again.  Thank you Andy for all your help.,5,0.9042

"Clean and tidy rooms (a bit sparse on storage as many stays are short stopovers), good restaurant, nice pool area - all in a good location by the Singapore river. Staff are very helpful, friendly and courteous.",5,0.9646
My stay was a stopover on my way home from Europe. I have stayed at the hotel on previous occasions and enjoyed my stays then. This occasion was no exception. I found it to be a good place to chill out before getting on home. The sevice was friendly and helpful as always. Nice breakfast with enough variety to please most people.,5,0.9337

Front door staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly. The breakfast buffet was a little disappointing but adequate",4,0.8707

"Booked at the last minute over the phone.  Specifically asked for adjoining rooms.  Front desk staff went out of their way to help.  Very close to all the shopping, restaurants in Clarke Quay but also great area within a couple of blocks that have restaurants and bars.  Pool had mostly adults but my 3 kids had a fun time in the pool anyway!  Great location, great room and great service!",5,0.985
"We booked on a recommendation and wasn't dissapointed it's in a great location for getting about with just a short walk to two MTR stations, the staff were very friendly and helpful, our room was on the 8th floor it had great views over Clarke Quay and the pool, which we used a couple of times. The hotel was very clean couldn't really fault it they even had a shuttle bus that would drop you off at various locations. I would recommend it to anyone staying in Singapore.",5,0.9667
"We stayed at the Park Hotel twice in February/March.  Just before our cruise and straight afterwards.  It was a tricky time in Singapore as a whole due to corona virus, but the hotel dealt with it well, taking all guests temperatures and providing hand sanitiser.  We were in a club room for the February stay and upgraded to a suite for the March stay.  Both rooms were well set out and the bathrooms were spacious and spotlessly clean.  Sadly the Club Lounge was being refurbished and so an alternative facility was set up at the far end of the hotel restaurant.  It worked very well, and all the staff were keen to help/serve. The hotel has a tie in with tour company and their representative arranged tour bus tickets and Gardens by the Bay tickets and was very helpful with ideas of",5,0.962

"Its often the little surprises that get you when you stay at the different hotels around the world and this one came in the form of the fabulous Atigha from their front office. To be honest, on arrival I was very disappointed. The room was not big enough to swing a cat so I enquired about finding an alternative. The management sort of tried their best but weren’t finding me the answer. I was supposed to stay 5 weeks so this was an important choice. Thankfully they introduced me to the very capable and kind Atigha who asked questions and understood my situation. It wasn’t the money it was the flexibility and given the dwindling occupancy rate due to Covid19 all it needed was the right approach. She listened to my problem that I  needed a desk to work from and room to move around",4,0.9604
"A reasonably small hotel of only ten floors in a great location, super close to two MRT stations. Staff are excellant and very helpfull. The pool area is big and very nice. Ask for a river view room as the views over Clarke Quay and the city are gorgeous. Wouldn't stay any where else.",5,0.9441
"A wonderful place to stay, fabulous staff and we were always looked after so well. There wasn’t anything to be negative about, apart from having to leave, but we will be back soon. Do the Crystal Club, we did and it’s well worth it!!",5,0.8596
Its a great staycation!! As we enter the hotel we were greeted by the staff and they offer us some drinks. I was serve by Donna and then Andy came to greet us . The check in was smooth and fast . The check out was fast too . Nevertheless I enjoyed my stay here ! Thumbs for the friendly staff . ☺️,5,0.9421
"We stayed in the Park, Clarke Quay for the first time this trip and we were not disappointed. The staff are excellent as are the facilities in particular the pool area. In the past we have stayed at Park City Hall and decided to stay at Park Clarke Quay as an alternate and we rate both hotels highly. The Location at Clarke Quay is fantastic, there are many restaurants at both Robertson and Clarke Quays just a few minutes walk away. We recommend this hotel. ",5,0.9072

Fantastic Location just a short stroll from Clarke Quay itself.  Very central in Singapore which meant we could get to see all yje sights we wanted to see very easily. The staff were great - so friendly and helpful even in the difficult time of Coronavirus.  Hygiene was excellent. Special mention goes to Mugi who was brilliant!,5,0.9789
"We stayed here in December en route for Cambodia, Vietnam and Australia.  so did many other guests.  We were treated with startling efficiency, but also great courtesy and thoughtfulness.   Rooms are a little small but we guessed that, like Hong Kong, real estate is at a premium on Singapore island.  singapore is like a theme park in many ways, unbelievably clean and safe.   This hotel is close to all kinds of restaurants so you could feel you were anywhere in the world.  ",5,0.984

"Excellent location - regular free shuttle bus service to other Park Group Hotels in the city.  Orchard Road just gets better and bigger every time I visit.  There is a supermarket opposite the Clarke Quay hotel and great evening meals in the hotel bar.  Breakfast is very generous - everything you need to start the day.  Unfortunately, the Singapore Flyer (Big Wheel) was out of commission  for routine maintenance during y visit!",4,0.9476
"This was a good place from which to visit all the key places in Singapore. The staff were really friendly and helpful. Also very viglant regarding Covid-19 which was in fact reassuring.This is the same throughout Singapore( perhaps UK can learn from them!). The rooms at hotel were not big but sufficient and had all necessary facilities, fridge ,safe etc bed wasn't big but OK, good sized shower. Breakfast was adequate but you had to beware of the birds ie not to leave table unattended.",4,0.9126
"Rooms are tired looking but comfortable. Fab location. Bar and restaurant prices a little high for what they are, breakfast was really overpriced so we ate out.  Parking for residents should also be free as they are in most other places ",3,0.9178
"Great hotel. 350m from nearest MRT (Fort Canning on Blue line) about 5 mins walk. About same distance to Clarke Quay and all the food/drink places located there. Rooms are not huge, but big enough and sufficient storage for clothes etc for a 5 day stay in March 2020. Really nice pool, big enough to do proper swimming in, not just having a dip. Breakfast is excellent, well organised and plenty of fresh stuff brought from kitchens from 0730 to 1030, so no need to rush down early. We were on 9th floor (room 920) but on the north side of the building so no view of the river. If staying again (which we would be happy to do) we would ask for river/pool side room. Very comfortable bed; slept really well - but we did walk about 20k steps a day while we were here! Staff all very helpful.",5,0.9804
"We order Iberian Pork &amp; Prawn Chorizo as main, prawn &amp; avocado as appetizer and fries for the side.  I like the pork most, so tender and delicious.

"Stayed at the Park Hotel for a couple nights, as a stop over, from a family visit in New Zealand, hotel is clean n friendly, staff very helpful, also, with the Covid 19 virus, they check everyone going into the hotel....

"I stayed in a hotel nearby the Park Hotel, I was totally lost and needed someone to escort me to back a place that I needed to go. Thank god I saw this young man name Mugilan  and he clearly told me how and where to go to that place. If he didn’t gave the direction correctly and clearly that day I would have been gone lost.

Hand sanitizer everywhere, immaculate hotel and temperature checks daily. See you all when I return from Australia. Xxxx",5,0.9051
"This hotel is in a fantastic loaction with most sights being within walking distance.  We booked a week in a Crystal Club Room. Unfortunately whilst we were there the lounge was closed for renovation.  We only made use of the 'club' at cocktail times, which was extended by half hour as recompense for lounge being closed.  Because the lounge was closed, they were using a private dining room which joined onto Porta restaurant.  Seats were quite limited due to diners in the restaurant also using them.  The food and drinks however were first class.  Staff were very generous with the drinks although on occasion there were not enough staff members to cover the number of guests.  The staff were running about like headless chickens at times trying to accommodate everyone.   I had read",4,0.7506
Lovely hotel. Really good staff. Polite and friendly. Enjoyed a walk along the river which is just at the back of the hotel. Good food.   Tanzir was especially helpful managing to get our room ready when we first arrived and sorting out other queries that we had.,5,0.9682
A good 4 star hotel but 'superior' was no better than in dozens of other hotels I've stayed in.  Staff very helpful and efficient.  Covid 19 precautions dealt with good grace.  Very handy for restaurants around Clarke and Robertson Quays.  Easily walkable to CBD after you have worked out how to cross main road.  Metro station 5 mins away.  Porta Spanish themed restaurant had good quality food but from a restricted menu and small portions.,4,0.973
We stayed here for 2 night when returning to Singapore.  The hotel is ideally located for the hustle and bustle of Clarke Quay or it's quieter relation Robertson Quay.  The later has all the quaintness we valued without the madness of Clarke Quay so either can suit your varying needs.  The hotel is well appointed with a lovely outdoor pool and pool bar.  We hooked directly with the hotel and became a member which we thought entitled us to some discounts which were appreciated.  What was a pleasant surprise was that as a signed up member we were given access to the Crystal lounge from 5-7pm each night for snacks and drinks including alocholic drinks which were nlimited during this time and also we could take breakfast (even though we booked room only) for no additional cost in,4,0.9666
"hotel was a bit away from amenities but the metro/tube was quite near. Clarke Quay although nearby was a fair walk away using the riverside walk, particularly if you do not have full health as 2 of our party. Even further if you walk via the streets. Hotel reception staff were very helpful restaurant and bar staff verged on the rude side disinterested in serving you really.Chef aiming for cookery awards rather than good quality serving, portions were very small and potatoes and veg were extra,on the single occasion we ate there,   dinner service was so poor 1st night,  we never ate there again. drink prices were extortionate for poor beers.",3,0.3644
"I would like to thank the Porta team and the hotel staff for ensuring my experience in the property is memorable.   I would like to thank Kyle first for his warm welcome and suggesting Porta restaurant to try out on my first time.  When I entered the restaurant, I was received with a very warm greeting by the waitress, Kavitha. Whom showed me to my seat and provided the menu for me.  I ordered the Salmon Tartare, Black Cod fillet, a glass of Golden Goose and finally for dessert, Cake of the day.   The tartare was appetizing and delicious, the cod fillet was firm and mixed well with the sauce. The cake was overall average, but nonetheless good.

"Overall we enjoyed our stay here - good location, great staff, excellent pool.  Good comfy beds and decent bathrooms.  Breakfast was a little unexciting but perfectly decent.  The hotel seems to be used by lots of tour groups, so this does mean it can get quite busy at times as groups take breakfast or check in and out. .  I was a little disappointed with the booking promise on the hotel’s main website which maintains the hotel will match any lower price on other booking sites, and even offer a discount.  I found a lower price on a well-known search engine, but the hotel’s first response was to question the legitimacy of the offer.   When I booked using the search engine’s lower price and brought this to the hotel’s attention the response was to point me at the small print of",4,0.7347
"My Husband &amp; I started our Honeymoon in Singapore and spent 3 nights at the Park Hotel in Clarke Quay. We were met on arrival with a welcome drink and our bags were taken to the room. Our travel agent had kindly upgraded us to a Club Room as it was our honeymoon on 9th floor which had been suitably decorated. The room was quite dated but clean and the bed was very comfortable. As part of the club room package we could also use the Crystal Club on the 10th floor, unfortunately this was closed due to refurbishment. They had set up a small area offering complimentary drinks in the main restaurant but wasn't quite the same.

We found the room still to be small but lovely corner windows views all around &amp; above the pool. Decor quite dated but very good shower! Very happy with location - each evening we walked either along to Clarke Quay or Robertson Quay. Great variety of reataurants/bars at both places. We were disappointed to find out the Club Lounge was under renovation when we got there(hadnt been informed) &amp; had to go through the Porta Restaurant to ""private area"" instead. This was more than made up for by the staff here! All couldnt do enough for us, lovely &amp; friendly &amp; shared lots of tips on how to get around to places we wished to see.

Walk by the banks for 2 kms and you can reach Merlion, while soaking in the brilliant vibes at Clarke Quay, the Arts House, the museum et al. Ticks most boxes - spic and span hotel, decent amenities.  Two things that stuck out a bit for me:  ONE - staff at the reception could be a bit more helpful considering they get people from all over the world at their doorstep.  TWO - all rooms are rather small. If you are a family, you could be getting into each other's hair most times.    ",3,0.8805

Very limited wardrobe space and no drawers.   Whilst there the club room restaurant was closed due to refurbishments, so had to use the Porta restaurant on the ground floor.

We were on our way home from Australia and the Covid-19 epidemic was escalating. The staff were helpful and friendly but were obviously under considerable strain. We had our temperature taken each time we entered the hotel.   We arrived in the evening and checked in with no problem. The staff were helpful with the baggage. We were tired as our body clocks were still on Queensland time. We went downstairs for a light meal and a glass of wine.   Our room was very good and serviced promptly every day. There was a good variety of food for breakfast although one could not count on the same things being there every day. It was pleasant to sit outside for breakfast.

We had this booked for us and initially thought it was in the middle of nowhere with access very limited. It is actually well located with restaurants and bars galore at the end of the street. It has a convenience store opposite which is useful but as always shop around for the best prices.  Getting to Orchard Rd is a 30 minute walk and the nearest MRT fort canning is just 7 mins walk away with direct links to the airport (takes about 45 mins) and costs about £2 for a single.  There is an on site restaurant which looked good but we didn't try it and a pool/fitness area.

Staff were very helpfully particularly the concierge who helped us out with booking trips and taxi information would stay there again and would recommend this hotel.,5,0.9682
Firstly I have to say how great the staff at The Park were and the 3 rating is not a reflection on them. The hotel in my view is only really suitable for a 1 night stopover if you have a flight or cruise next day. I was staying 3 nights and had reserved a club level room. The room was very small and when the cases arrived there was no where to move around. I then upgraded to a suite which was a better size. The Club level lounge was set up as a cafe so no lounge chairs etc not really meeting my expectation. The location of Clarke Quay is a bit misleading as it is much closer to Robinson Quay. All in all the hotel needs a refurbishment. Would I recommend this hotel - possibly if someone needed 1 night stay but not really for any longer. As I said earlier the staff were great but,3,0.8338
"Booked a Crystal Club room on 10th floor and it was worth the extra since our room was spacious though at one time had obviously been two very small rooms. The sitting room had plenty of storage and an en suite shower and the bedroom also had good storage and a  bathroom. A strange set up but the extra space and storage was much appreciated. We also very much enjoyed the delicious breakfast served in the 10th floor lounge but it was sometimes crowded as it was early evening when drinks and snacks were served. Also appreciated the free laundry service which was one garment per person per day.

I agree with other reviews that the inside breakfast area is very cramped with everyone too  close and after the first morning we chose to sit outside.

This hotel was recommended by Travelbag. It suited us very well being close to an MTS station (Fort Canning).  It's also close to many popular restaurants. The room was small but adequate... except there were no drawers to put clothes in. The breakfast are was small and cramped with not a lot of food choice.

What a great hotel. Rooms spacious and clean. Most importantly is its location. Just a few minutes walk from Clarke Quay. Also near to an MRT so the whole of Singapore is just a few minutes walk away. Didnt try food or bar as we did both at the Clarke Quay complex.,5,0.8553
"This was a great place to start our mega holiday. Good location &amp; lovely staff with great service. Perfect location, close to things we wanted to see &amp; connectionscfor those further away. Very close to the MRT",4,0.9694
"Hotel quite nice and located in a great part of Singapore close to restaurants, bars and transport.  Nice pool area.  Very easy to get to central attractions.  Hotel staff were very helpful.  We would return to this hotel again.",4,0.9588
"We stayed for 4 nights in this lovely hotel.  Arrived at 8.30 am and they kindly gave us our room even though check in is 2pm.  All staff are polite and helpful.  We stayed in a Club room which I would highly recommend.  Service in the Club lounge was excellent and the complimentary drinks and food served in the evening were excellent.  Thank you to concierge staff too so helpful.  Used taxis to get around which are so reasonable or walked.  Highly recommend Gardens by the Bay, Raffles, and strolling this lovely clean city",5,0.9898
"Had a 3 night stay here at this hotel. Good central base, 5 minutes to nearer underground, the tourist travel pass is worth buying at 30 Singapore dollars, plus a $10 deposit. Refund. Hotel was clean comfortable and staff were polite and attentive. Breakfast area could do wia refurb",4,0.8689
"Stayed for 4 nights at Park Clarke Quay Hotel on 19 January 2020. Highly recommend paying extra for a Club room if possible which gives access to the Club Lounge on Floor 10 for breakfast and drinks and canapés from 17.00 - 19.30. Tasty snacks and good quality drinks and beverages.  A corner room on a Floor 9 - 932  is worth requesting because it has super views down towards the riverside. Expect room 1032 has same view.   The rooms are on the small size, but have comfortable beds and very good housekeeping.   We found all the staff to be very helpful and efficient from upon our later arrival with the concierge and porter staff, reception staff and Club Lounge. They all were well trained and communication skills good. The staff appear a happy team and the only comment would be",5,0.9881
"Decided to drop by Porta after work with friends. Was served by Desiree, she is very detailed, recommending us the soup of the day and updated new menus. Lyn is very friendly, created small talks with us. James is very cheerful and helpful. Food is very appetising. Chefs is very obliging too, accommodating to change some of the side dishes for our orders requested. Will definitely come back again!",5,0.9487
Excellent location for Clarke Quay and Robertson Quay and Riverside walks. Great swimming pool with bar and food service. Excellent breakfast but can be a bit chaotic when busy. Did not eat evening meal at the hotel as there is a huge variety of restaurants along the river bank.,4,0.5994
"Stayed here for two nights on a stopover on the way to New Zealand. Busy hotel, Room wasn’t ready when we arrived but offered a free coffee while we waited. Nice comfortable room. Good location near nice riverside walks.  Short walk along the riverside to shops and restaurants.",4,0.9716
Highly recommend the Club rooms they represent excellent value for money as the food in the lounge is plentiful and of good quality. The beds and pillows were super comfortable ensuring a good night's sleep. All the staff were friendly and obliging. ,5,0.9781
"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for our honeymoon. We arrived to a beautiful room with a swan made from towels and gift chocolates. A lovely touch. We had the crystal club included in our stay which was awesome. Staff were friendly and helpful. Many thanks to Tharan, Mugi and Tini who were especially helpful and always had a smile.  We would definitely recommend this hotel :)",5,0.9883
"Stayed here for 3 nights en route to Adelaide, Australia. We booked through Trailfinders and hotel location and quality was excellent. Breakfast selection was excellent. Omelettes cooked in front of you if you preferred this to the vast selection of food choices. The room comfort and cleanliness could not be faulted. Great swimming pool and poolside bar serving drinks and food. Will select this hotel when next in Singapore.",4,0.8244
"Room is small compared to some hotels, the bed for us wasn’t the comfiest but am sure other people would be ok with it. The room was very clean, in fact the whole hotel is immaculate. Breakfast is good and the staff were all very nice. The pool is great plenty of seating around the pool, service was ok around the pool. Would we stay again wouldn’t be our first choice but wouldn’t complain if we did stay again.",4,0.9748
"The Park Hotel provided an excellent base to explore Singapore, only 45 minute walk from the 'Gardens by the Sea' and 5 minutes from a metro station (Fort Canning DT20). The 'Crystal' Upgrade is worth considering.",4,0.6808
"Marvellous few days at this hotel. Arrived early from London, reception very helpful and we took advantage of a reasonable upgrade which gave us a better room with a brilliant view, breakfast and lounge access. Go for a corner room if you can.  Room comfortable and well equipped. Staff throughout extremely helpful, particularly the concierge team who were always smiling and offering assistance.  Slight downside was pool area always busy and beds scarce, breakfast choices felt limited (more fruit needed). The club lounge was quite small and felt simply like a converted meeting room, it should have been more comfortably appointed.   Temperature checking on entrance was a little disconcerting but this is commonplace throughout Singapore during the current outbreak. ",4,0.9098
"This is a well maintained hotel with very comfortable rooms - the beds have a cozy mattress topper. There is a very attractive swimming pool with Greek Columns and a pool bar/restaurant. Free WiFi is provided, which is very efficient",4,0.9358
"Came here for my godsons wedding with all my family,and what a great time we had. My favourite things about any hotel is location,food,comfort,cleanliness and a good shower, and this hotel had it all. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The pool was lovely as well. Would definitely recommend this hotel ",5,0.974
"Fantastic location, easy access to Marina Bay and Sentosa Island via nearby Fort Canning MRT station. Walking distance to Clarke Quay, felt very safe whether walking or using the MRT, unlike a lot of cities. Polite, friendly and efficient staff, continuously checking temperature outside lobby which was reassuring considering recent events and helped ease initial worries travelling to Singapore. Overall had a fantastic experience in the city and would love to return soon. Wouldn't hesitate to stay at the Park Hotel again.",5,0.9794
Park Hotel Clarke Quay is an easy hotel to locate.  It is situated very close to the river and we walked from Marina Bay to the hotel along the river walk.  The staff are all very helpful and friendly and nothing was too much.  The room was extremely comfortable with an excellent shower.  There is a lovely outdoor swimming pool on the 2nd floor.,5,0.9663
"First class hotel, all requests addressed. Very clean and booking in very fast, allocated room ready early. Pool area clean and tidy. Club Class was a pleasant surprise and staff worked hard with a smile.",5,0.9323
"The Park hotel was a $25 taxi ride from the airport on a quiet Saturday afternoon. There’s a concierge to grab your bags much quicker than you can them out of the cab &amp; they then wait in reception until check-in is complete when they deliver the bags to your room – no tip is expected. We thought the rooms here were on the small side, but having spoken to someone staying at the nearby Holiday Inn it seems they’re pretty reasonable for central Singapore. The bathroom is quite snug, but it’s clean, nicely decorated &amp; has quality fittings. The bedroom itself has enough space to walk around both sides of the bed, small wardrobe including safe, a desk, two chairs, enough room to fit a large bag and that’s about it. All rooms look like they have a balcony, but it’s for decorative",4,0.9776
"This hotel is well situated, within walking distance to some of the great experiences that Singapore has to offer, like Orchard Road Shopping, Clarke Quay Entertainment precinct, Raffles Hotel, China Town; and a short taxi ride to Little India, Marina Sands Hotel and the Bay Gardens. We were on the Club Level floors with access to the Club Lounge, the lounge was very good but very busy at times, we also found the room a tad small. The hotel has an excellent pool and pool area and the staff are extremely friendly and helpful, we had a great stay.",4,0.9824
"We stayed for 3 days en route to Sydney. Didn’t know what to expect of the hotel as we didn’t really research it as the trip was put together for us. Wow, were we pleasantly surprised. First of all, Singapore is spotless, I mean absolutely spotless. The hotel is the same, so clean and fresh. We went during the Coronavirus outbreak so each time we went back into the hotel our temperature was checked. It was fast and efficient and always done with a smile. The staff are amazing, very helpful and polite. The rooms are lovely and clean. The beds are comfortable and the bathrooms are nice with a powerful shower. We ate breakfast in the restaurant near reception and there was a huge choice for everyone, the food was fresh and tasty. The swimming pool was nice and clean and the water",5,0.9944
"What can I say, well situated, could not have been better. Great people, great hotel. Right in the middle to see everything. Easy walking distance to wherever you needed to go or places to see. Taxi service was second to none",5,0.8955
"We loved our time at Park Hotel. Staff were great, letting us check in early in the morning (ideal after a long flight from the UK), rooms were beautiful, food was great and the upgrade to Club was really worth it as we enjoyed drinks and light meals throughout. Highly recommend ",5,0.9758
Good central location with friendly helpful staff. Lots of restaurants within walking distance but not impressed with nearby shops. Spacious room with comfortable bed. Bathroom has walk-in shower. Staff recorded temperature of everyone entering hotel because of Corona virus outbreak.,4,0.7243
"A super staff with a super service. I wont Mr Raj the bell boy who have very helpful in my taxi booking for the duration of 10 days. He gets things done as per request.

"A short one day stopover on our way from New Zealand to UK.  Very efficiently dealt with on arrival, baggage transported swiftly to the room.  A splendid breakfast with lots of choice for different tastes. And a very helpful shower facility made available before departure.  Just right.",5,0.9019
"Good location. Crystal club room well worth the extra cost, although the room was compact there was everything you needed in the room. The snacks and drinks in the Crystal club lounge between 17.30pm and 19.30pm were fabulous, as were the staff serving us. Next time we are in Singapore we will definitely stay again at The Park Hotel. ",5,0.9001
"Easy transfer on the MRT from airport to Fort Canning station, hotel just a short walk away, Clarke Quay station is also nearby. Booked a Crystal Club room which was on the small side but nonetheless very comfortable.  Plenty of wardrobe space, tea coffee making facilities, safe, hairdryer, TV, wifi. Crystal Club lounge on the 10th floor included tea/coffee/soft drinks and snacks throughout the day and drinks and nibbles in the early evening, office facilities. The evening drinks were very popular which meant the lounge became very busy. Breakfast was also served in the Club Lounge and at times slightly chaotic which put the staff under pressure. Complimentary laundry service was very useful. Fort Canning Park with its historical references is a short walk away. Pleasant",5,0.9711
"This hotel is a great place to stay. Staff were excellent - friendly, helpful and so accommodating. My wife and I got a room on the ninth floor overlooking the front of the building and it had just be refurbished. The pool with restaurant on the second floor was also a bonus as we spent our last day in Singapore lounging around the pool having refreshments. A particular word of thanks to the Concierge, Hamraj, who was extremely helpful and offered our taxi to the airport. Great stay, great hotel!",5,0.9855
We had enjoyed our stay. It is in a good location &amp; the staff were friendly and efficient. Our only criticism was the room was small with little storage space but otherwise well equipped. The pool was very welcome as the weather was hot &amp; humid!,4,0.9106
Had a lovely stay recently in Singapore. Park Hotel at Clarke Quay has a great location at Clarke Quay. The staff were excellent and very friendly indeed. Shuttle bus to Orchard Road and other locations/drop offs were great time saver. Highly recommend you think about this Hotel if visiting Singapore.,4,0.9719
I have no issues with the hotel or the staff but my work finished early and when I checked out I was told I would be charged 50% of the room rate for each day I left early.  This after I had already been there for 2 weeks.  Beware! ,3,-0.4753
A brilliant stay.  Staff always polite and helpful. Room extremely clean and comfortable. What more can I say.  we will recommend the hotel to friends and family as it is in an ideal location to all the main tourist attractions in Singapore.,5,0.9749
We stayed at this hotel 3 nights.  It was in a great location and the staff was very friendly and helpful.  The room was clean but there were no cabinets with drawers so it was difficult to unpack.  There was a closet so that you could hang a few things that also had a safe. Would definitely recommend this hotel.,5,0.8975
"We have stayed at the Park Hotel on a number of occasions and we decided that we would upgrade to the Crystal Lounge this time. Breakfast in the morning, drinks and nibbles (5.30pm to 7.30pm) were included within the booking price. The service in the Crystal Lounge was very good and the choice of food and drinks was good. The staff are friendly and helpful and they made us feel very welcome.",5,0.943
"This hotel is in a good location for Clarke Quay, the subway and buses. The staff were very attentive to our needs with both check in and out both being completed without any fuss or delay. There are a number of restaurants all around the hotel from very busy to quite ones.",5,0.2263

"This hotel is a stone's throw away from Singapore's Clarke Quay, well known for it's restaurants and nightlife. The hotel is extremely close to Fort Canning MRT making the hotel extremely accessible. The hotel's accommodation is  adequately sized and spotlessly clean. The business suite on the 10th floor offers hardwired internet facilities. The staff are exceptional, extremely polite and attentive. The breakfast was also excellent and well supervised. See you next December!!!",5,0.8879
"We stayed for 7 nights in a Crystal Club room on the 10th floor.  The rooms were very comfortable, spotlessly clean and very comfy beds.  Lovely shower in the bathroom and tea/coffee/fresh water each day.  All the staff were super; friendly, helpful and attentive from every area of the hotel. Swimming pool was great and again very friendly staff.  Near to two MRT stations and two minutes from the river and evening entertainment, bars and restaurants.  Having stayed at other 5 star hotels in the city would highly recommend.",5,0.9866
Stopped here for 6 nights in January and the hotel is really nice. Rooms are a bit small and not much storage space but as you are not in the room much this wasn’t a problem. The MRT is 5 minutes away and Clarke’s Quay is just round the corner so this hotel is in a good place. Rooms cleaned well and the staff are very friendly.,4,0.8514

I've just booked our 4th visit to this lovely hotel such a great location close to everything.  We now book the Club Rooms such good value and the staff are so wonderful always on hand with a cold drink anytime of the day.
