"We happened to be there just as COVID-19 was ramping, and really enjoyed our stay there.  The happy hour was great to mingle with other travellers and exchange stories, the balcony converted into a bathroom was fun, the proximity to places of interest was good, and overall the experience was great.  Will definitely visit again.",5,0.9806
"Such an oasis in the middle of busy Singapore.  The old colonnial style of the hotel is reflected in the calming and restful environment in the hotel.  Our room was beautiful - plenty of room with a separate large bathroom area with bathtub and large shower.   The electric roman blinds were a great touch.  The staff could not do enough for us, being very professional yet friendly and approachable.  I would thoroughly recommend the hotel and book again at the drop of a hat.  Thank you for a lovely stay.",5,0.974
"Fabulous hotel with a history. Small hotel but excellent service, lovely rooms although the bathrooms were a bit disconcerting ! Lovely pools Great and historic setting ( was Britain’s headquarters before the fall of Singapore) Loved the guest wine hour was a lovely treat. Close to lots of amenities and restaurants. Good restaurant, lovely breakfast. Fabulous staff",5,0.9954
Special thanks to the service team for assisting me with my less than 24 hours request and also arranging to change my check in and out date with such a short notice period. Very happy and satisfied with my stay.,5,0.9128
"We really enjoyed our stay, excellent hotel facilities and polite helpfull staff, interesting local history and good location with peacefull walks through Canning Park.  Would return and recommend to others. ",5,0.9371
"I purposely choose this hotel because of the historical value. Beautiful colonial style, well maintained. Also feel very peaceful, it’s suitable for nature &amp; history lovers. Friendly staff, simple unique room decor (as the bathroom in the balcony) but I just love it! Especially with the wooden floor...really make me feel, step back in kampung time!",5,0.9488
"The room was great, I loved the outdoor patio (deluxe garden room), staffs were very professional and polite, service was top notch. Only downside was the breakfast which didn't include enough meats and the hasbrown wasn't crispy",4,0.8316
"Room was very good, odd that the bathroom was in the window, but all fine.  Very clean &amp; comfortable.  Liked having dressing gown &amp; slippers useful for visit to pool.  Shame the larger pool was not open all the days of our stay.",5,0.9407
"Had an enjoyable time during my 2D1N stay! Nothing to complain much + all staff was attentive and welcoming!   There wasnt much reviews on the hotel’s restaurant so my expectations wasnt high and was not really looking forward, but i enjoyed the breakfast buffet + their lobster nasi lemak!   Only thing was the pillows was not suitable for me, and i wasnt aware there is a pillow menu ):  So those who are planning to go can take note of this!",5,0.7486
"The hotel is set within Fort Canning Park within 5 - 10 mins walk of 2 MRT stations.  Initial impressions were good although our greeting at reception was a bit brusque.  I fully appreciate that the hotel was concerned about coronavirus, as were we, but the first words out of the man at reception was “I need to take your temperature”.  A hello and welcome would have been nice first as we had been travelling for over 20 hours.  It was good that they also did this daily at breakfast and also before I could use the gym.  Our room was lovely but, as others have said, you are unable to use the bathroom without putting the electric blinds down first.  The design of the shower meant that water leaked onto the bathroom floor. This is because the door sits on a raised piece of marble so",4,0.9638
A truly unique hotel stay in Singapore amongst the greenery of Fort Canning Park. The hotel is atmospheric and beautifully appointed.  Close to Dhoby Ghaut MRT station for easy access to everything in Singapore. Staff were only too happy to accommodate our every need and assisted with lots of useful sightseeing advice! The restaurant was delicious and inexpensive. The swimming pools were perfect and complimentary towels appreciated. Our only recommendation would be that the raised tile edge around the bath in the room is a trip / toe stubbing hazard for travellers in unfamiliar rooms during night time bathroom visits. ( We had a garden view room).,4,0.9834
"In the middle of a park with easy walk to Orchard Road when going down, but there are some escalators on the way up. There are 2 swimming pools, and at the time we were there no one else was using them. Would stay there again.",5,-0.2144
"Hotel Fort Canning was converted to a hotel from being the headquarters of the British government when it occupied Singapore.  The hotel has a nice tropical ambience.  The rooms are spacious and situated so that the tropical feel is there.  Overall, a bit expensive but worth it.",5,0.5023
"Hotel Fort Canning set atop Fort Canning is a genuine 4 to 5 star hotel . The quiet atmosphere and surrounds enhances relaxation . Great staff , and that includes those in the restaurant. The latter provides good food at very reasonable prices .",5,0.886
"Good location if you are fit enough to handle the steps/slopes to walk back through the lovely park back from the the city and/or are happy to use taxis. Really good swimming pool areas. Breakfast was very good. Garden room not really worth the extra cost since, given the humidity, we didn't use the facility much.  Complimentary drinks and canapes  between 6pm and 7pm  a nice touch. Hotel staff very helpful and welcoming.",4,0.9824
"The hotel is in a graceful old (but well refurbished) building at the top of a hill top park near the CBD. I had a very comfortable room with a patio - although note that curtains need to be deployed to have privacy from anyone walking past, Easy walking distance to several excellent museums through a lovely park (dont miss the Apothecary's Garden). After a long humid day exploring Singapore it was lovely to come back to the hotel for a swim and to relax in comfortable surrounds. Staff always at the ready to assist.",5,0.986
"Stayed at HFC because we had a concert held at FC itself. It was accessible for us. Booked a Deluxe room for 1 night and upgraded to Deluxe Garden another night. Total stay was 3 days 2 nights. Both rooms were beautiful! Brought some friends over the second day to chill before the concert however, the staff informed that they could only stay up till 930pm which was totally fine with us. Overall, we were pleased with they stay! Would definitely come back again especially if there are concerts that are playing at FC!",5,0.9466
"We did our wedding here at HFC and also stayed here for a few nights. The experience was way beyond our expectations. The hotel is beautiful, styled in old colonial style, complete with all the most modern facilities. Staff are one of the most amazing team of people I’ve ever met! From the front reception to the concierge, from the banquet staff to the restaurant/bar team - everyone fully demonstrated service with a smile - making our stay the most pleasant ever. The complimentary drinks (sparkling, red and white wines + juices) n canapés served daily at the nice reception area for all guests was definitely a delight. We weren’t the only ones who were blown away. In total we had 7 rooms of friends and relatives who stayed here too and all of them were full of praises for HFC.",5,0.9863
"Lovely stay at Hotel Fort Canning for our wedding. The team has been helpful and supportive, very thoughtful in celebrating our joy and making the stay comfortable. Acceded to our requests to make the bridal pick up convenient. Beautiful location to taking our wedding pictures.",5,0.9791
"Staff were friendly, helpful and seemed happy to be working at fort canning.  Lunch at the salon was great, loved the lobster nasi lemak.  Great decor of the hotel, has a good historical and cultural vibe to the architecture.",5,0.9769
"We stayed for two nights and in a standard room. The hotel is beautifully appointed and the rooms luxurious - high ceilings and marble everything in the bathroom.  The high ceilings made the room feel a lot more spacious and our large windows looked towards Canning Park.  We were advised on checkin that there was a wedding the following night but we didn't hear a thing so the noise did not disturb us.  It is lovely to walk around the park in the early morning and it is very close to the MRT, Clarke Quay and the Singapura Mall.  But the standout for me was the service on the front desk.  They diligently but respectfully took our temperatures on checkin and when we asked them to daily (due to the corona virus precautions).  They helped with grab taxis and information but I was",5,0.9323
"We loved everything about this hotel! The staff were so polite and helpful getting us taxis. The room was very clean with a great bed and shower! Breakfast was very good, lots of choice and we loved the pool. The hotels position was great, we walked down to Clarke’s key in the evenings and really enjoyed walking through the park. We would definitely recommend this wonderful hotel to everyone and would not hesitate to stay here again. Well done and a massive thank you to everyone who made our holiday so brilliant! ",5,0.9946
We shall always choose the Fort Canning. It is a little oasis in a busy city. Ideal location for anything you want to do - easy to get a bus or MRT anywhere in the city.  Staff are charming and extremely helpful. Nothing is too much trouble.  Excellent breakfast.,5,0.9381
"Our second visit to which we greatly looked forward and which was every bit as pleasurable as our first four years ago.  An impressive, fascinating historic building with a warm and stylish ambiance.  Beautifully appointed and comfortable rooms.  Set in lovely parkland grounds, a delight to stroll in.  Convenient central location. Quays easily walkable.  Lovely pools, lovely breakfasts, lovely Happy Hours.  Good in-house dining arrangements that are sensibly priced.  Most importantly every member of staff, without exception, was courteous and attentive. They are all relaxed, approachable and so very professional.  As memorable and relaxing a hotel experience as you could possibly wish for.   If ever in Singapore again, this is where we will stay.   Meanwhile we unreservedly",5,0.9952
"Held my wedding at Hotel Fort Canning and it was simply amazing. Love the Legends Ballroom and the greenery around the hotel. Thank you so much for the hospitality in hosting me and my family as they enjoyed the hotel stay for the past 3 days. Special thanks to Kelson, Debra and all the managers who assisted me during my wedding. ",5,0.9607
"We usually do walks and exercises at the Fort Canning park and everytime we pass by the hotel we always like the vibe hence we plan to stay one day. Now that we are in, the impression we had is the same or even better.  The location is within the city center, accessible by a few walks from both Fort Canning and Dhoby Gaut MRT stations. Despite the city location this hotel is tucked within the greens of the park giving you that peaceful and relaxing feel.  Check in was a breeze, i like the sit down-table kind of style, very personalized. Julian was attentive and thorough, he also took time to walk me through the amenities of the room, very good customer service.   The room is well divided, it has modern amenities with classic interiors. I really love the bathroom, very spacious",4,0.9785
"Had such a warm welcome upon arrival by Kelson, the front office manager. Everything was went through thoroughly. There was a small rebate given upon check-in since we booked directly from the hotel's website. Thank you to Julian too for showing us the room. Love the service and room amenities. Quiet ambience although shops are slightly far from Hotel. Thank you HFC!",5,0.9245
An old style hotel brought up to date in a quiet location in the park but actually only a short walk downhill to canal and places to eat and shop.  We chose this place because we don’t like the huge corporate type soulless hotels and because it is in a quieter location. It came at a competitive price compared with the corporate hotels so perfect. The room was excellent with everything we could need and a comfortable sleep. Breakfast gave a good choice of Western and Eastern choices.  Two pools which were always quiet. A pity the sun-beds don’t have mattresses There is a restaurant for evening meals with the typical mix of meals.  A nice touch was the free guest drink between 6 and 7.   Perhaps a member of staff could circulate and give guests an opportunity to ask questions,4,0.9907
"Stayed at Hotel Fort Canning on a recommendation from two friends who had stayed and we were delighted we did. Wonderful colonial building set in historic Fort Canning. Great location 10 min walk from Orchard Road and the MTR and 15 minutes walk through the park to Clarke Quay on the river. Very much a garden oasis in the middle of Singapore. I exercised regularly in the Park as well as the in house gym (lots of great kit).  We arrived about 2pm and checked in without a wait. Really nice room - feature is the bathroom at the window end of the room. Good lighting and storage. The two swimming pools are wonderful and manage a garden feel.   Service was excellent.   This is not a big chain hotel so less staff and the team multi tasks. Reception doubles as the concierge, as well as",5,0.9838
This hotel is a perfect example of the reuse of a classic colonial style building. The location is excellent within the park and easy walking distance to the city. Rooms are large and well presented with all features of the rooms very useable. Good size pool. Restaurant is good and buffet breakfast excellent. Staff are extremely helpful and friendly. May not be the cheapest in town but definitely worth it. Would definitely stay again if stopping over in Singapore.,5,0.9699
"The hotel is 500 meters from Fort Canning Station, from where you have a very good connection (blue Downtown Line) to Changi Airport. We particularly liked the Fort Canning Hotel: - nice and helpful staff throughout the hotel - beautiful and large two-part rooms - two very nice and well-kept outdoor swimming pools We can only recommend this hotel.",5,0.9642
"We had an excellent stay at Hotel Fort Canning for two nights.  Zen atmosphere with top quality accommodation, large room in a cozy environment right in the city.  Service was excellent and breakfast were very good.  Highly recommended.",5,0.9294
"Hotel Fort Canning is a great hotel to stay whilst visiting Singapore, our room was very comfortable, the staff friendly and efficient service. Breakfast was of good quality (the coffee could have been a bit stronger)  Only negative was there were no cushions on the sun beds but overall a very enjoyable stay and would highly recommend this hotel.",4,0.9303
"We enjoyed the location and convenience of Hotel Fort Canning because it's in town and there are a lot of things to do. But at the same time, the lush greenery and quietness surrounding the hotel (it's on Fort Canning Hill) makes for a calming respite.   Service was excellent and I just want to call out Kelson Yeo for his welcoming and great attitude too!",5,0.9538
"My room was ok.  Comfortable bed and pillows.  Nicely appointed bathroom.  Strange to have the windows all along the bathroom.  Breakfast was a letdown.  Getting taxis takes some time. And, getting a taxi to find the entrance to the hotel was quite complicated.",3,0.765
"The hotel is set in a small park in the centre of Singapore. The building has a colonial history as has the surrounding area. Positioned on a hill the park has covered escalators to acess the nearest metro station. The bedroom was a good size, with a large comfortable bed, as was the bathroom which had a bath and seperate shower.  Public rooms are of a reasonable size, well decorated and comfortably furnished. Staff went out of their way to be helpful. Breakfast, lunch and dinner menus were good, with local dishes, but fairly limited.  Complimentary drinks and nibbles between 6 and 7 were appreciated by most guests, plus an extended Happy Hour in the bar and restaurnt.",5,0.9657
"I would stay at the Fort Canning again But it lacks that edge of a great hotel The service was good but not outstanding,the bar service was disappointing and we had to go to the bar to get served on nearly every occasion even though  there was no one else in the bar The room for me was on the small side and the bathroom which is two walls of glass  was a little disconcerting for me That said the bed was very comfortable and we slept well A very nice and quiet hotel The breakfast was good but not outstanding after the Hyatt in Vietnam  and the Sofitel in Cambodia",4,0.8224
"I know this City well and had lived here for 10 years, came back to visit. Picked this hotel due to its colonial appeal. Quite misleading, tiny claustrophobic rooms, very inconvenient to go back and forth from, barely any actual colonial ambience. Room cleanliness mediocre. I would definitely not recommend this hotel given the plenty of choices Singapore has to offer that are much better, more convenient and come at a much more attractive price. I give it a poor rating.

"This was my third stay at Hotel Fort Canning, I must repeat comments I made on my previous posts regarding this hotel. It really is a beautiful hotel in the most stunning gardens, it's tranquillity amongst the busy Singapore City makes this place so unique. Two beautiful swimming pools and relaxing area's to sit in out out of the sun, great breakfast and excellent staff. Special mention to Abigail, thanks for all of your help finding and booking for us great restaurants and making our stay so enjoyable. I will be back with my family later this year",5,0.9913
"We have stayed at this hotel on the last 3 visits to Singapore &amp; love it. The staff, the location, the service, the food, the pools. It is our oasis holiday on our journeys to Europe.  And we enjoy it so much that we always stay a few days.  On a visit last July our child got sick, and we had to extend our trip to 1 week. The staff were so helpful with advising where to go for the best doctors &amp; accommodating us during quite a stressful time.  Can not thank them or recommend them enough.",5,0.9203

"We have organized multiple events through this hotel involving both conference packages and organization of hotel rooms for visitors (including around 20-30 reservations placed over the last few years). We have also personally stayed in the hotel on several occasions both for holidays and work reasons.   The rooms and facilities are very pleasant, however  the main reason we continue coming back to this location is the staff. The hotel staff are always very thoughtful, I always get the impression that they have carefully considered my request and done their best to acomodate it (even if sometimes the answer is no, in general it is clear they have clearly thought very hard about how/whether they could make it possible). Overall this makes the hotel a very relaxed place to deal",5,0.9665
I have been to Singapore many times. Always staying at whatever shopping district and looking out to busy streets or smack into other buildings. This time around the weekend was about relaxation. Hotel Fort Canning is on top of a hill and park. When you lookout the window its either greenery or distant buildings. No cars zooming pass. Awesome rooms as well. I love the location and the staff was always on point and ready to be of assistance. The best part of this hotel is its staff and the location. The rooms are very clean and modern too. I could not believe such a chill place existed in this busy city.,5,0.9722
"I only had the pleasure of spending one night at Ft. Canning, but it was an excellent night! The hotel itself is charming and old world and the setting high on a hill in the middle of an urban forest park is gorgeous. The hotel was convenient to the sights of Singapore while being quite and secluded at the same time. My room was spacious and well appointed and most importantly, luxuriously comfortable and quiet. The pools are wonderful, and I appreciated a separate lap pool. I hope to be able to return someday.  ",5,0.993
My husband and I stayed here for two nights during our short visit to Singapore this January. We absolutely loved the location of this hotel as it was on top of Fort Canning Park. We felt so peaceful and secluded from the busy streets of Singapore.   The hotel rooms are lovely and have high ceilings. I used the gym once and they had a good range of equipment. Since the hotel is in a park you could definitely go outside for a run.  I would highly recommend this hotel! ,5,0.9705

"We hosted a conference dinner at the property and was utterly disappointed in everything. We hosted a cocktail session in the basement common area before dinner but the beer machine broke down shortly after our guests arrived. There was another party hosting a dinner on the other side of the banquet hall and several of their guests started smoking in the common area but the hotel claimed they couldn't do anything about it. The service staff for the dinner were also somewhat unprofessional when serving the dishes, putting the plates on the table quickly and spilling the food occasionally. The plating was very messy and the food, in general, did not taste good. We asked the hotel to book a shuttle to transport our guests after dinner but the shuttle was late and also wasn't",1,-0.921
1st impression is that the hotel is situated conveniently near mrt station and in town but still peaceful and beautiful when it is right in the middle of the city... able to Go for a walk at Fort Canning Park and kids can play at the jubilee play ground nearby...

"Hotel Fort Canning is a pleasant surprise in the urban jungle of Singapore.  Despite being conveniently located in the central of Singapore, it’s nestled within lush greenery and away from then city hustle.  The colonial hotel exterior is grandiose, yet the facilities of the hotel room is very updated and technologically advanced.  The beautiful fusion of history and modern comfort makes the stay with Hotel Fort Canning a memorable one.  Was especially impressed with the white marbled bathroom boasting the garden view.  The design of the hotel room also allows abundant sunlight and great view of the surrounding foliage.  The hotel staffs also display exemplary hospitality, from the check-in counter staffs that lead me all the way to my room after checking-in and orientating me",5,0.9652
"I loved the ""welcome back"" I received from the front desk and the fact that they were able to check us in early with no bother.  The pool area is lovely though the sun beds/round pool loungers could do with some padding/mattresses.  The hotel was extremely quiet for the festive period which I guess is why they tried to shut the bar at 10:45pm one night!  Seems a bit early for a 5 star hotel.  My only other grumble was again related to the bar - there seemed to be a very young and inexperienced chap serving who just didn't seem ready to be (mainly) left on his own to serve drinks.  Poor kid looked petrified at times.  Other than that, it is my favourite hotel in Singapore, just a few steps away from the Battle Box tour (of an Underground Bunker used by the Allies during the",4,-0.1285
For a hotel that boasts a 5 star rating you would hope that they have a more understanding and sympathetic reservations and customer service team.  I've had to cancel a planned trip in February due to some distressing personal circumstances. Given the advanced notice I thought I'd receive a more understanding response from the hotel. I understand there are cancellation rules with third party bookings but after asking to explore options and seeing if a solution could be reached (ie paying a cancellation fee etc) I then received a message that was a flat no they cannot help me at all and that I should 'keep my reservation'. I think there should be exceptions in certain circumstances for unexpected situations. I do know that I will not be going to Singapore as planned just to 'keep,1,0.5782
We stayed for three nights and had a view over the city. It’s set in a wonderful old building and we had canapés and drinks each evening. Being the rainy season the hotel was quiet but location is central to orchard rd shopping. Would recommend. ,4,0.6652
"We were in Singapore several times for business purposes and we appreciated a lot. That is why we have decided to stay a short week for tourism purposes this year. The some years ago, I was in the hotel Fort Canning and I had a good memory of my stay and especially the fact that this hotel is in the heart of a beautiful park.

"Was booking a 1 night stay due to a friend's  event in the hotel. Even though I drive around Singapore I was caught out when my GPS directed me via Coleman street up Canning Rise. But this road is now closed past the Registry of Marriage. You can only reach this hill top hotel in Canning Walk via Stamford Rd.   I'd booked via a booking portal and had been worried since the room was for friends, not a couple, as all the photos showed transparent glass bathrooms, some apparently with the bathtub in the actual bedroom.   However upon a speedy check in I was glad to find there were roman blinds separating the bathroom (renovated on the former balcony). Even so, the receptionist reminded me three times to close the blinds to the huge window as people can look straight in.   Though",4,0.8402
"There are many nice things about this hotel.  The room was amazing and beautiful and relaxing.  The breakfast buffet was comprehensive.  The staff were very nice, sometimes too nice.  I felt like they wanted to make me happy even when they really weren't sure what they were saying:  bad directions, strange consequences of questions asked.  The setting is beautiful; the park is gorgeous.  But that was one of the problems I had with the hotel, which they can't change obviously.  The hotel is kind of isolated from things, which is saying something in a city like Singapore.  It takes some time to get to the subway stations or to walk anywhere.  So, there's nothing wrong with the hotel, and I'd stay there again, but I probably would probably try to get a hotel closer to the CBD.",4,0.9318

Nice hotel Love the bathroom concept Clean and tidy Suitable for couples and solo Not so sure for families Breakfast was so so Pool was very clean. Thankfully not so crowded Loved the bicentennial event which took place beside the hotel. Which was very convenient,5,0.8734
"This hotel is different from almost all other hotels in its location in a park. Very quiet for Singapore, yet in the middle of the city. Good museums nearby (National Museum, Battle Box). Make sure to request a room facing the park on the 3rd floor. Less than 5 minutes walk to 3 different MRT (metro/underground) stations. 4/5 stars because breakfast buffet is adequate but not overwhelming. Nice seating outside. Pool is very nice, hardly used. Separate lap pool. Rooms are unusually well designed, minibar gets restocked. Room Service is very friendly and is very good. This is more of a honeymoon / holiday type of hotel, rather than business. They do have a lot of weddings - held on the city-facing side of the hotel. This is why you should request a room on the park-facing side.",4,0.9659
"This is my 3rd stay in 2019. Came for the U2 concert, left with much much more, thanks to a series of fortunate events. We ended up being invited to preview chef Jeffrey Tan's Xmas Otak-otak Turkey. Considering otak-otak is a steamed fish cake, one would have thought fish and poultry don't mix. But his otak base was chicken with traditional otak spices and otak stuffing served with roast vegetables and potatoes. The turkey turned out extremely tender and moist, especially the breast, even the drumstick was not left behind.  The awesome turkey lunch came with the hotel's world class fish head curry served with crispy roti prata and briyani rice, pork pong teh, nyonya chap chye and a heaping mound of Singapore Hokkien Mee with oodles of prawns.

"Spent three nights at Hotel Fort Canning, with my elderly mother, stopover between Australia and UK. Loved the hotel. Former British colonial admin building, used also I think as Japanese army HQ during war. Set in park, surrounded by lush greenery, it has a lovely feeling of space, of being away from the bustle of the city yet everything is easily accessible. Literally on the door step of the fascinating Battle Box and a stone’s throw from the National Museum. Room was very comfortable with stunning bathroom, though had to close the blinds between the sleeping area and the bathroom, not sure who would appreciate having the toilet in plain view of the rest of the room?

From reservations by the welcoming Maggie through to guest service team on welcome- Shana and Ivana- To Steven and his restaurant team namely Shri and Ruby and of course not forgetting Long term manager- Kelson- this hotel never fails to disappoint.

We've been brought to our room and staff showed us around the room on how to use the controllers and informing us on what is complimentary in the room which is already a thumbs up.   The location is great, about 10mins walk down to Dhoby Ghaut mrt or Plaza Singapura. The hotel itself is beautiful.   The amenities in the room, the bed is huge, the controllers for the lighting and curtains are all on touchscreen panel. The toilet is grand, there's shower and bathtub and basic toiletries are provided. There are karaoke rooms and gym but its only for club members so sadly",5,0.8559
"Booked the anniversaries in the park package to celebrate our wedding anniversary, because we held our wedding there.   The main bugbear was the dinner for 2 @ the salon, which was included in the package.  The restaurant staff seemed to be quite unprepared for us, even though I had corresponded with the reservation staff on the dinner when making the booking about 1.5 months prior to our anniversary.   The staff gave us a choice of a seat, kind of squashed beside the wall, neighboring another couple. The other choice was beside the glass door leading to the outdoor area.  We chose to sit beside the glass door. It was kind of a mistake, because the waiting staff used the glass door for their service. So the glass door kept opening &amp; closing during our meal, &amp; hot air came in.  ",3,0.2516
"Thanks to all the staff in HFC for a well run event for my company. The rooms, venue and overall experience from participants around the world was first class! Staff were very accomodating and ensured every detail of our event was attended to. Great rooms and great location.",5,0.9259
"This former military building has been converted into a lovely hotel in a very quite park in the centre of Singapore.  The rooms are spacious and clean, the only down side would be the location of the bathroom, which is on the window - literally, which means that you need to close the curtains when you’re using the washroom which makes the rest of the rooms quite dark.  Otherwise service, food at breakfast and poolside was good.  We would return.",4,0.8555
"Lovely weekend staycation with my spouse. Things that we love: 1. Surrounded by much lush greenery, and open lawn spaces. Felt we were faraway from the city. 2. Boutique hotel- only 86 rooms, so felt we had much of the swimming pool to ourselves (and there were 2 adult and 1 kiddie pools) 3. Standard deluxe room was nicely done up, marble flooring of the bathroom gave a very luxurious feel.",5,0.8519
"There’s nothing bad about this place really. The service is genuine and warm. they recalled my previous stay, tried to check me in early, changed rooms upon request, and offered to store my cake in a freezer in the interim. Hotel location is about ten min from Dhoby Ghaut train station. Room is modern with good tech, and nicely acquainted (albeit small). But it’s the details that are lacking - the window blinds for external facing windows are fully opaque (no partially opaque second layer to allow light while minimising visibility). no bathrobes. table side lamp broke and dangling. evening canapés had a very small selection, were not regularly topped up, and was hosted in a very small sitting area (it was thus overcrowded). Brut and even wine glasses ran out early and were not",4,0.7543
Hotel was a lovely historic building with only 85 rooms. It has been very well restored retaining a lot of the historic features.   The location in the middle of the park is great for evening and morning walks. Fort Canning park has a lot of interesting nooks to explore.  and is close enough to Clark Quay to walk. Staff were very helpful and because of the size of the hotel were able to remember who you were.  Happy house for house guests was a nice touch,5,0.9757
"What a magnificent place to stay! Such a relaxed &amp; welcoming atmosphere. Surrounded by a wonderful park full of sights &amp; history.  All the facilities are top class. Staff were always helpful, even when we stayed for hours after our check out time. Would highly recommend to all of our friends and family to stay here when coming to Singapore.",5,0.9735
"Ok hotel. Nicely appointed and Fort Canning is a less visted area well worth the effort to visit. Room layout a bit odd and privacy is compromised with a view to creating smaller rooms. Little things like no robe, ran out of toilet paper and main telephone not working detracted from a five star experience. Staff were willing.",3,0.7918
"First class, old school hotel, ideal for  couples and those wanting an old fashioned high quality break. Fort Canning park is a sanctuary is the huddle and bustle of Singapore. A must if you like history",5,0.7096
We arrived late afternoon after a long flight from London and were warmly greeted by Kelson. Our beautiful room was ready and we were able to shower and head down to the private sitting area for drinks and canapés followed by a delicious dinner in the hotel restaurant. A very positive experience for our 3 night stay.,5,0.9571
"Colonial style living in HFC is guaranteed, the luxury is unobstrusive and comfortable. One exception though I have to point out: the space for the toilet in my room was so narrow, that the sliding glass door had to remain open during use. Travelling as single that is just ok, but for a couple is not tolerable.",4,0.4118
"It was my first staycation experience and I thoroughly loved the experience. Being a lover of nature n solitude, I am blessed with all.  From the moment, I checked in, I feel at home and kindly treated by the concierge. I received my birthday cake and a card signed by the staff.   The room was simply a delight. The only thing that bugged me was my stay was too short. Haven’t enjoyed the room enough. An excellent space for my quiet time. The bathroom was lovely too!  This certainly will not be my last as I plan to schedule a longer stay the next time.  A big thank you to all the staff who made my stay so memorable.",5,0.9882
"We absolutely loved this hotel. So lovely and clean, our deluxe room was large and the service we received was incredible. Everything was perfect from the moment we got out of our taxi, a special thank you to our wonderful team member Kelson who checked us in - he was absolutely amazing!!",5,0.9827
Good hotel with good amenities. Not very good accessibility . The nearest metro station is atleast a 10 minute walk. And it’s a steep uphill climb on the way back to the hotel. Not feasible if you’re travelling with elderly parents ( like we were ) or small children unless you’re willing to spend on taxis (very expensive ).  The breakfast spread was lovely and met the standards. The view is nothing to boast about. But evenings are nice and quiet and good for short walks around the campus.  Overall a good hotel but I wish it were closer to the MTR/bus stop or the hotel had offered complimentary buggie rides up and down the hill . Given a choice I would opt for a hotel with a better location.  That’s why I give it 3/5 .,3,0.965
"Hotel Fort Canning is a wonderful place with a restful and quiet environment within a beautiful park. Staff are so attentive and helpful. Room was lovely and comfortable, everything we needed . Enjoyed a great breakfast and swimming in fantastic pools . Hotel is close to all amenities , eg walk to museums and shops / restaurants . Station for underground is 5 min walk. Great - will stay here again .",5,0.9885
"What an elegant hotel. Situation central Singapore, this hotel offers the comforts of home. Set amongst the beautiful park in central Singapore, this hotel offers peace and tranquillity, away from the hustle and bustle.  We were so fortunate to spend 6 nights at this hotel, and we would stay there again.   The staff are exceptional, we particularly found Vinash extremely welcoming hospitable and personable.  We would not hesitate to recommend this beautiful hotel.",5,0.9797
"Very peculiar location, in a central area of Singapore, between Orchard Road and Marina Bay but immersed in a park and part of a heritage site. Comfortable, large and silent rooms with full service and hospitable and amiable reception. Wide range of breakfast offer, pool, spa, gym. Definitely enjoyable.",5,0.9231
"Ive always wanted to stay at Hotel Fort Canning after seeing so many beautiful photos of the hotel. The colonial style building is really beautiful and well maintained. Check in was very personal and efficient. The room was quite small but had a nice decor. The toilet was spacious with a nice bath tub. Breakfast was alright - not a huge variety but passable. One thing though, maybe it’s the building being quite old, the rooms were not very sound proof. You could hear your neighbours shutting their doors all the time. Overall it was a nice stay, just that if you don’t drive, it isn’t easy to get there. Lots of steps to climb to get to the hotel by public transport.",4,0.9716
"We have just spent four days here at the start of our trip to the Far East. As other reviewers have pointed out, it’s not too far from the main attractions (though we mainly used taxis are we are quite jet-lagged!), yet it is so peaceful up here. The room is very comfortable, though not too private as we were above the main entrance, and had to close the blinds whenever we were in the room as there is a public path facing the room! One thing we weren’t aware of is how hilly the park is, so paths are steep, and there are lots of stairs, which was exhausting in the hot, humid weather. The reception staff were absolutely excellent, and nothing was too much bother for them, and we particularly enjoyed the free wine and canapés between six and seven every evening.....something you",4,0.9604
"we like to return to this place. it's not the usual anonymous huge hotel chain, the staff spend the extra effort, the room design in this old colonial building is really attractive, and the quiet location in close proximity to all downtown places is priceless.",5,0.7902
The best hotel with very cozy environment &amp; deluxe furnishing room. Staffs are nice &amp; very helpful at all time. This give me an unforgettable hotel living experience in Singapore. Definitely will choose to live in Fort Canning hotel next time. Really appreciate that. Thanks,5,0.9581
"We stayed here for a one-night stop over enroute from London to New Zealand. We arrived long before the normal time to check in. The staff did their best to both make us comfortable while we waited, and provided us with an early checkin (much earlier than we might reasonably expected). We had a late flight out, and again - they granted a late checkout, as well as ongoing access to hotel facilities (pool, showers etc.).  The lcoation of the hotel is delightful, as is it's charm.  A walk around this historic site is both interesting, and educational - given the role of this location on Singapore's history.  Highly recommended.",5,0.9623
"The website reads ""Hotel Fort Canning is an iconic 5-star luxury heritage boutique hotel in Singapore. Experience impeccable luxury in an urban oasis in the heart of the city.""  This could not be further from the truth. This hotel is barely 2-3 stars on a good day. I've travel to Singapore frequently and I've never found a reason to write a review before, but this was an exception. I stayed in room 103 from 20/10/19 to 24/10/19 and this is what I found:  - Disgusting, stained, greasy bed head. Seriously filthy. Obviously never cleaned. See photo. - Serious mould in the shower. See photo - Broken doorstop. See photo - Peeling wallpaper. See photo. - Disgusting stains in the bathroom all around the toilet. Obviously does not get cleaned properly. What a joke. See photo. - Outdoor",1,-0.9091
Hotel Fort Canning had a sense of tranquility in a very busy city. The regular happy hours introduced us to fellow travelers and we had many a good laugh. The service was impeccable both with the standard of the room service and restaurants as the staff remembered the way I like my coffee and the tea my husband had.  The pool was set in a lush garden setting and floating in the water was very relaxing after a busy day. A great experience overall,5,0.9722

Thoroughly enjoyed our recent visit to Singapore. Stayed at Fort Canning Hotel for 3 nights. At first I thought it was a bit out of the way but although it is located in beautiful parkland it is surprisingly central. The hotel service was excellent and very personal. Highly recommend.,5,0.9665
"Whilst seemingly a little out of the way (being atop a hill) the hotel was quiet and being surrounded by park and was like an oasis in the teeming city of Singapore. Once oriented, it was simple to walk down to the main areas. Hot weather and after extended walks, a reasonable taxi ride back was worthwhile. Happy hour was enjoyed by many guests.",5,0.8979
"Big and clean room, with ensuite bathtub.  Pleasant stay with excellent customer service.  Has a good spread of breakfast selection, with the choice of freshly prepared eggs, pancakes as well as roti prata (which is out of the norm).",5,0.9393
Stayed two nights. Excellent value. Restful hotel vibe allowed me to catch up on work and prepare for meetings.    Internet excellent. Staff friendly and helpful.  Breakfast espresso could be improved.  Will stay again.  Loved the building’s history.,5,0.9758
"Personally I love old building and this hotel meet my standard.  Though location is not at the advantage, perhaps Management to consider having a shuttle to the nearby shopping site.  You have the feeling of the colonial era, there is also a short distance to the park where you can do jogging in the morning or evening. The staffs are also excellent in delivering the service.  Thank you",4,0.8796
"This was our first time at Hotel Fort Canning, and it exceeded our expectations!  Booking through the website was easy, and when we needed to make an upgrade prior to our arrival, the staff was efficient and eager to help.  Once we arrived, we had no idea how stunning the location is right next to Fort Canning Park. We felt that we were in an oasis inside bustling Singapore.  The staff was able to accommodate an early check-in, and while we waited we had a delicious meal at the bar.  We were personally shown to our room, where our bags were already waiting. There is happy hour every evening at 6pm with Prosecco, wine and appetizers.  The rooms were impeccably clean, well-appointed, with views of Fort Canning Park.  Buffet breakfast is extensive and delicious.  Even after only",5,0.9761
"Birthday staycation for my Mister over the weekends, and we love every hour spent there. This even started from the splendid hospitality given over email correspondence with Ms Maggie on reservation and room service arrangement.  Checked in to highest level, corner room with city view. Despite the wedding conducted right below our room, the noise level was bearable and it ended before 11.30pm. Fabulous high ceiling room with user-friendly room controls, sufficient tv channels and generous amount of TWGs &amp; nespresso capsule. Aircon was slightly weak though.   Love the spacious toilet where tub and shower are separated. However, marble flooring and just 1 floor mat made prone to slips. Water easily flow out of the shower, but that might be just us. Basic toiletries provided. Weak",4,0.7063

"One of the best and most beautiful hotels I ever stayed at in Singapore. Luxurious, elegant and classy. It's magnificently restored and wonderfully maintained.   Service is impeccable and the rooms are very streamlined with touch control buttons to power everything. Nespresso machines and capsules provided as well as TWG Teas.  The bathroom is amazing with marble bathtub and separate rainshower.  The hotel is also beside the Fort Canning Park so a nice stroll either in the morning or afternoon is perfect.",5,0.9903
"Our room was spacious and nicely decorated.  Love the floor to ceiling windows and the sitting room.  The hotel is close to multiple metro stations, so it is a good base.  The hotel is more or less in a park which allows for nice long evening walks. ",4,0.9196
"We really liked the idea of staying in a low set former British building in the Colonial District, set amongst the parkland.  We were not disappointed.  We have fallen in love with Singapore.  The Singaporeans are very helpful, very polite and very house proud of their Island.  These qualities were found in abundance at HFC.  We stayed in a delux room on the second floor with breakfast included and we also had Dinner in their Salon restaurant, twice.  We liked everything about this hotel and its location and it will be our future choice to stay here.  Walk, catch a Taxi or get an Ezi Pass to use nearby MRT trains.",5,0.9414
"My husband and I got married at HFC and spent our wedding night there. Our stay was so comfortable and enjoyable. Elegant decor, comfortable and luxurious. The staff were so polite and professional, everyone treated so nicely. Breakfast was delicious (try the eggs Benedict from the eggs station!) with a mixture of both Asian and western options. We did not manage to take a swim but the pool is chlorine free and filled with mineral water, which sounds great and non-hair-damaging. Beautiful heritage hotel in a site of historical importance. A very classy establishment that I would recommend to everyone. Thank you so much for starting our married life off with such warm hospitality and wonderful service!",5,0.9944
"Stayed at HFC for 3 nights before heading to Ubud and Sanur in Bali having not previously visited Sinapore but having stayed in a number of other countries and cities in Asia.  Arrived at HFC around 9am having previously emailed hotel for an early check-in for our two premiums rooms to be told they were fully booked the night before and therefore unlikely, but we still felt optimistic they might be able to arrange something on the day. Walked in to reception after ~20 hours travelling to find a single receptionist somewhat stressed and clearly stretched. Whilst polite, the greeting lacked intimacy, engagement and any level of support with the position being that our rooms would not be ready until 2pm, perhaps 3pm, and no offer or direction to any facilities or amenities.

"Situated quietly in the Fort Canning Park and yet located conveniently between shopping district ie. Orchard, Dobhy Gaut and the clubbing and night time happenings district ie. Clarke Quay. This is how unique the Hotel Fort Canning is. My husband had picked this place due to the wonderful, responsive service he had received from the staff while planning for a birthday surprise for me. I was touched by the birthday cake slice and candle provided by the management, together with its other surprises it had. Loved the little garden although I would have wished the haze did not have spoiled the day. In terms of design of the room, maybe because I have experienced better ones, I will like to suggest my feedback hoping it will be more thoughtful in design the next time. Love the",3,0.9806

"Hotel Fort Canning is an elegant hotel in the middle of downtown Singapore but situated within Fort Canning Park permitting a rare combination of convenience and relaxation. The hotel is appropriately sized, neither large nor small.  Rooms are non-traditionally designed which can cut both ways but I found it fine.  The room isn't particularly well-appointed but bot lacking either.  The mini-bar could be improved significantly. Overall, a great hotel worthy of its price.",5,0.9676

"Had a great three night stay at Hotel Fort Canning in September 2019 and we have no hesitation in recommending it.  We are regular travellers to Singapore who usually stay in the Orchard or Marina Bay areas. We chose this hotel for a change because it is surrounded by parkland. The Fort Canning park location didn’t disappoint, it is a very tranquil location and the big windows in our premium room’s study and bathroom looked out onto a wall of green. Both the room and the grounds are beautifully kept and aesthetically pleasing. The front office staff / managers are very helpful &amp; efficient, nothing was too difficult, thank you especially to Kelson Yeo.
