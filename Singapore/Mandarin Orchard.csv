"It was a staycation, as we had credits to use up before the end of March. Check-in process was relatively long and there were two staffs handling the process. We were introduced to their mobile app - it comes with a 'bluetooth' room key, which was supposed to allow access to the elevators and the room - it failed a few times. There was a moment we got stuck in the lift because the room key did not work after we left the hotel to explore around.  Temperature checks were placed at the entrance. There were sanitisers too.  Location was superb.  Convenience stores were about 50-60 metres away, and there were loads of food options. Grabfood works perfect too.   The rooms were spacious. We also appreciated that our rooms had two basins! The workstation was awesome too - the only gripe",3,0.9392
"Booked the room in the morning and checked in at 3 in the afternoon. Flawless check in process, was greeted by lovely swans and a chocolate cake as they knew we just got married. Due to the pandemic virus Our honeymoon to Turkey got cancelled but Mandarin Orchard simply made us satisfied with their service and wonderful premier room!",5,0.9279
We booked this staycation during the worst time as the covid19 restrictions were in place. At first we were apprehensive about going as we do not wish to contract the disease but the hotel manager assured us of the many precautions that they had undertaken. The temperature screenings and declarations were cumbersome but yet necessary. I just hoped that better crowd control could be done to ensure guests do keep their distances as we had someone cough and sneeze just a few feet from the next counter from where we were checking in.  We were impressed with the whole check in and welcome process but the room decor was underwhelming and dated. We did like the city views tho. The breakfast was changed from a buffet to ala-carte which we know was due to the crisis but it was served,5,0.9475
"We started on a lower floor but booked more nights and were upgraded to a room that had been recently refurbished. The higher room had a shower, whilst the lower room had a bath with a shower in it. Both were nice big rooms with all the facilities you‚Äôd expect and we upgraded again with an additional payment to get into their club area which due to refurbishment was on the ground floor adjacent to the bar and buffet restaurant. The hotel was very empty due to Covid-19 and we were heavily outnumbered by very enthusiastic staff. The buffet in the Triple Three restaurant looked magnificent and was clearly very popular with locals but there was too much food there so we opted to dine in the Chatterbox. This was excellent and I‚Äôd happily recommend it and a stay at the Mandarin where",4,0.9857
Had a much needed staycation for myself post birth and the staff there were very kind and helpful. Took up the promo for an upgrade and had zero regrets taking it up as the room was located high up and was spacious and clean. Loved the location. Had a good R&amp;R! Thank you! ,5,0.9504
"Many thanks BLAIRE LEE. Very good service. Excellent!!!  She helped me for my work, when I cannot go out at night. She spend her time for help meüëç Thanks you so much. You have a beautiful heart. Thanks you  ",5,0.973
It located right at center of Singapore Orchard Road; and easily accessible for great food and shopping nearby.  Superb service and attitude by hotel staffs. The restaurants in this hotel served quality food. ,4,0.891
was expecting more. hence disappointed. but best to go without expectaions.  very different from my last stay. that is why i have chosen my birthday staycation here. but many things / services are different now,3,0.6819
"We bought this deal, Run of house, way before the Covid19 breakout so it was more pricey compared to the price in March 2020.  The location of the hotel was superb. It was literally in the center of Orchard, so it was a walking distance to many places in town. But because of Covid19, we stayed in most of the time except to head out for food. The gym facilities were not too shabby, it was pretty spacious.   The bathtub was smaller than expected, and it was placed together with the shower head. The room itself was pretty spacious.  Housekeeping was done twice a day, so that was unexpected too, but thoughtful. Room service was quite slow, had to wait almost an hour for a bucket of ice and 20 minutes for a wine opener. But I think it was because of the Covid19 situation hence they",4,0.8462
"It was my first time having a staycation in Mandarin Gallery. However during the check in process , the staff are not aware of the promotion of the reservation. The check in process took a while before we are checked in.  The next day we had a breakfast at Triple 111 in the morning, we have ordered the American Breakfast Set and then the baked beans they served to us had turned bad, it tasted sour and spoiled. We informed the service staff and they took them away and that's it. Nobody came back to let us know what had happened.   Overall the room and location was good however with such experience at the check in process and restaurant, I will not book here again.",1,-0.1531
"The most disappointing is the breakfast. It's not a buffet at all. My room doesn't comes with breakfast. So I paid additional for my breakfast.  While at the counter no one informed us about the set menu that I need to order. The order takes so long that i took some breads while waiting and by the time the set menu arrived I am already full. The rooms are ok. Overall due to bad breakfast, my stay feels awful!",3,-0.883
"It's a famous hotel on Orchard Road - Singapore's principal shopping belt. This hotel has undergone several facelifts and I don't remember when the last one was, but it's clearly showing its age. Room was a good size, and the staff is excellent. I was lucky to get the room at a discount, but its usual price is 300% more and in my opinion one can get better deals.",3,0.9682
"Second time staying here and the experience is just as good. I cannot emphasise more on the great level of service I've witnessed during my stay. Love the rooms as well, with two sinks in the toilet with a mounted anti-fog magnifying mirror. The hairdryer holder is conveniently placed outside the bathroom at the full length mirror as well. Food at Chatterbox is delicious as well albeit on the pricier side. If you have the chance, do check out Shisen Hanten as the food and view there is marvellous.  Some things to note: - TV has no connectivity to Netflix - Pool closes at 10pm - Gym has a water dispenser - Nearest MRT is Somerset Station on Red line",5,0.9651
"Service staff is great. Had a complimentary cake for birthday celebration with friends. The hotel need to upgrade its facilities like tv, coffee machine and also clean the exterior windows. Will stay again if there is promotion",4,0.936
"Located right smack in the middle of Orchard Road offering shopping opportunities at nearby malls. Stayed in one of the refurbished rooms which was generally clean, except for the exterior window which looked like it has not been washed for ages with patches all over. Breakfast was decent. Gym was good. Swimming pool was disappointing.  Online booking was dodgy. Promotion price was the same for both king and twin rooms as advertised on their website. But on making payment, the price for the twin room was more than double that of the king room. Had to book the king room and called the reservation staff to change to the twin room at the same price. Management have to look into this issue.",4,0.6808
"Staff were great but the walls are rather thin, I could hear the impact on my door whenever my neighbours closed their doors. Other than that, the location is great and the room was spacious. Not too sure where the Swimming pool was, don‚Äôt think I saw any signs  ",5,0.7755
"strategic located, very friendly service, clean room, reasonable space. Have been here for many times and always come back to this hotel. Everyone in each functions are very informative, responsive, caring and friendly. Recommended!",5,0.9537
"love it! hope to have a good price promotion again. love the location. thank you for the high floor room. HOWEVER, breakfast wasn't fantastic... little range.. Triple Three has always been great with food...breakfast wasn't fantastic for your standard ",5,0.9594
"Very clean, comfortable room, toilet is also very clean. Good service from front desk, customer service, housekeeping and room service staff. Room service is very prompt and delivered our supper within 30mins. Food is excellent.",4,0.9472
"From the time we arrived in the hotel until we checked out, we were very happy customers. I like the Swimming pool very much. The place is very convenient. Hotel service is perfect. Everyone smiles and helpful. I feel at home in their hotel. I just love everything there!  ",5,0.9676
"We always come to Mandarin Orchard at least once a year. Top of the M was the reason. This time round, we were responding to a come-back rate from the previous manager who checked out our previous stay here before.  It was a bit disappointing when we checked in that Top of The M was under renovation. I felt a little sad because Top of the M was the reason to enjoy the Club Room at Mandarin Orchard. But the experience changed at the 5th level Club when we had a chance to interact with the assistant Club Manager, Elinna Ching. She was friendly, approachable and professional as we had a chat with her and she was ever so willing to share with us her experiences in the hotel industry. The other staff helping to man the club lounge were fantastic too, with a particular name by Weng,",5,0.9195
This being the Mandarin hotel the rooms had a bit of Chinese feel with dark wood furnishings and oriental art works.  I chose this hotel because of its location; you can't really beat this which is right smack in the middle of famous Orchard Road.  Lots of shopping and dining choices in the area.  MRT station is nearby so getting around the city is really easy and convenient.  We also ate the famously expensive Mandarin chicken rice at Chatterbox.  I can't say that it was worth the money at all.  Singapore has many chicken rice restaurants at only a fraction of Chatterbox's price yet they taste better.  I would recommend skipping Chatterbox unless you want to experience it yourself then do it just once.,4,0.8687
"I still like staying in this hotel because of the location that is so close to takashimaya, paragon, and other malls that I like to visit. Convenient also for my 2 young kids to find good restaurants to eat and shop for...well, toys! ",5,0.8016
Situated right in the heart of Orchard road with staff round the clock monitoring temperatures in this dire period give a very reassuring vibe to guests. Watched as they professionally and cordially handled drunkards who wandered into the hotel past midnight. Kudos to the team.  Very honest housekeeping staff who are not tempted by money left lying around or valuable electronic products. They keep the room spick and span.  The rooms are quite dated but well kept.,4,0.726
"The special stay rate for locals are attractive for a birthday treat. Spacious King Deluxe room is so calming, could have stayed there without leaving the room. My little girl loved the bed. Was further treated with birthday cake and the family had buffet dinner at 1 for 1 deal.   Buffet was a mad house, as Mon. has free flow of beer. Tempura counter was slow and would not entertain guests' prawns-request, BUT this intern, Willy, served a whole plate of prawns to his friends who dine there instead....that was very very bad. On the 2nd visit to 333, MAGGIE was worst, slower and much fewer cooked. I gave up on the que.  Steven was sweet who coaxed me with a chocolate slice cake with fruits.",4,0.3956
"I enjoyed a staycation here to celebrate my birthday. The team was vigilant, professional and friendly in their screening in this time of COVID-19, staff was frequently seen sanitising common areas. Check in and out was a breeze thanks to their efficiency. The room was comfortable with all the amenities that you require and we were well supplied with bottled water by the team.  The location of the hotel was excellent, with an attached mall, late night entertainment options just round the corner! ",5,0.9808
The Mandarin Orchard is so close to all the shops. The staff are very helpful. The breakfast choice is amazing. Near to public transport and the Hop on Hop off bus route that takes you to all that sites. ,5,0.7841
Check-in and out was a quick and smooth process. The rooms were well maintained with air conditioning at the right temperature. Bath was clean and the water temperature can be easily controlled. A wide variety of TV channels were available too. ,5,0.7351

Good Hotel at Orchard Road with great service and good hospitality. The Cleanliness was good. They handled the Virus Outbreak very well such that we as residents didn't feel panic at all. The staff were also more cautious on our well being.,4,0.9558
Room was big and clean with very good location around orchard . Late check out was extended to us and a baby cot was sent to us for our kid. Really appreciates !

"Room and their service are very good. Breakfast was very tasty everyday. The staff was very friendly and told us the recommended restaurant. There was Japanese staff, so it was very helpful. We are satisfied.",4,0.9243
"Due to COVID-19 crisis, I contacted both Agoda and Mandarin Orchard Singapore in order to postpone my stay, however, they both were helpless and even charged me very high for the postponement fees. Shame on both of them for taking advantage from guests during this crisis circumstances. To compare with 4-star-hotel like Novotel even give full refund to their guests, Mandarin Orchard Singapore is NOTHING!!.",1,-0.9335
I lost my item inside the hotel. I sent several emails to their FB messenger but no one ever replied. They just read my messages. So bad and I'm very frustrated and disappointed with this hotel. I hope they will act on my inquiry ,1,-0.9466
Staff lovely and helpful Room spacious and clean except windows. Bottled water free and tea and coffee making facilities Electronic room key worked well Lifts lightening fast Breakfast choice good  Position just off Orchard road so great if you like shopping as 26 malls on one road Bed was very hard,5,0.974

"I stayed here for 3 nights on business. The rooms are fantastic, they are large and have standard amenities. The bed was very comfortable, the toiletries provided were nice and the robe/slippers were a nice addition. The breakfast buffet had a ton of variety and was the best I‚Äôd ever experienced at a hotel. Hotel staff was very nice, entire place was very clean.  There is a lot of shopping directly around the hotel and taxis were easy to get right outside of the hotel.  I highly recommend staying here!",5,0.9813

"The rooms are spacious and laid out to maintain comfort and functionality.  Housekeeping service was always impeccable, housekeepers are very polite and ensure your comfort in the daily service and turndown service of your room.

"I arrivd at the Mandarin Hotel in Singapore at 8am following three weeks of touring India.  They allowed me to check-in early, upgraded my room and then I slept for 8 hours.  For this part of my trip I was travelling solo so it was especially nice to be greeted by name almost immediately by the people at the desk, the bell captain and the staff inside and out.  The concierge found a city guide for me as I had only 36 hours in SIngapore and didn't want to miss anything, he alsoo suggested a night-time safari - totally safe in SIngapore!!! The restuarants and tea rooms had fabulous food, I could relax in the lobby and sip a latte waiting for my guide.  Just wonderful service from a friendly warm staff!",5,0.9749
Room was large and clean. Separate powder room helps when there are visitors to the room. Living room and bedroom segregated nicely. Only issue was that the aircon for living room was not working optimally and it was quite warm. Air con at bedroom side was fine.,4,0.8493

"Hotel was in great location but breakfast was something else, couldn't drink the tea or coffee and bread must have been a week old! Would rather have booked room only and got our breakfast elsewhere!!",3,0.5308
it's not a 5 star hotel standard at all. i don't recommend and never go back again. staff very rude. rooms not clean. the price is not worth it at all. but  the location is good. there are many better options around there. ,1,0.617
"We stayed at Mandarin Orchard at Singapore in big group. We were on a business trip ( Professional Training). The hotel is at the city center, close to local transport station. Local Metro was very close. The porch of hotel is at the main road and Local Rental Taxi comes direct into the Porch. Moreover the local shops, are very close. Tourist spots were nearby. The hotel rooms gives direct view of famous tourist attractions. The concierge services were also very professional. The restaurant services were prompt .",5,0.4215

"a good balance of central location on orchard road itself. i tend to avoid orchard road hotels due to sense of over commercial feel and business. but mandarin has a cozy side entrance while sitting smack next to takashimaya. lots of good local food in comfy foodcourts within 5min walk. the reception level is on 5, not particularly obvious when you arrive n have no prior experience. swimming pool entrance could be better located, smack nxt to main reception. 24hr gym is kinda secluded with only stairs access after u take d lift to 37th.",5,0.7391

The room was spacious and has a nice view,premium ambience and amenities.Plus side is the location which is in the heart of the busy shopping district Orchard Road.The downside?

Although our stay was short 3nights in total I would highly recommend the hotel for all small families, business travels or any short term trip. The restaurant and bar have a luxurious setting and during a trying time such as this Corona virus issue the staff actions make you feel comfortable in the fact they are doing everything possible to maintain safe and healthy environments for both staff and clients alike. A beautiful luxurious place with the a convenient location and service to suit all needs. ",4,0.9647

Club floor has great views and excellent food. Yet, for me, it didn‚Äôt quite hit the spot. Little things, I thought the hotel lacked an identity because it‚Äôs integrated with the shopping mall. I had a club premier room which was huge and beautifully fitted out with a marble bathroom, super multi jet shower, full bath, loads of wardrobe space...but my oh my the bed was hard, even the pillows were like boulders.

"For this hotel you‚Äôre paying more than anything for the location, which is superb. Great to be able to walk straight out into the middle of Orchard road. Had a run of the house package.  Room I had was large, if a little dated compared to some of the other offerings in Singapore. All the various towers and different elevator combinations also take some getting used to, perhaps because of the way it has developed over the years.   Service was fine, whether check-in / out, concierge or breakfast.

well located hotel on orchard road. staff who checked us in was very nice and polite and addressed our requests. staff at the club level were very polite and attentive especially the young gentleman. the door man on arrival was not helping until I went to  him and told him to help with the bags. It would be nice if the hotel offered returning guests some incentive or special prices  for the rooms or even a bottle for the returning guest  .any way  we had a good time in this hotel. the only problem I had was that after we checked out and travelled back home the house keeping manager sent me an email saying that the umbrella that was in my room was missing and that if I do not return it they will charge me for it. I sent back my reply saying that the umbrella was in fact inside,4,0.9062

"I've reviewed this hotel a while ago and figured it's time to refresh the review since I've been back a few times.  As always, the hotel itself is great. Still a bit dated but that aside, the staff has always been wonderful. I've had an incident in one of my stays but the hotel manager, Mr Danny Wong, was prompt and efficient in looking into it.  However, this review is more for the Meritus Club lounge staff like the Club Manager, Elvie and Assistant Manager Elinna who go above and beyond and delivering heartfelt service to their guests.  They are truly an asset to Mandarin Orchard and exemplify great service delivery.  The Meritus Club is another great asset with sweeping views of the city. The food offered constitute a dinner rather than snack but if there is one thing I can",5,0.9923
"Overall, it was a good experience staying at Mandarin Orchard although there was a minor issue during check-in but Rochelle was very quick to sort it out. Well done, Rochelle. What amused me though was I had to download the hotel‚Äôs app in order to go through the check-in process (in my opinion, unless you have hundreds of hotels globally, then it‚Äôll make sense to download the app. Alternatively, why not use a web-based app? Wouldn‚Äôt it be easier for guests if the hotel insists on having an app?). The app itself was only used ONCE because after that, it constantly required me to reactivate it at the Front Office! Anyway, the room was well-kept, spacious and adequate for a 5-star hotel. ",4,0.9325
"2nd time to stay at Mandarin Orchard in Singapore. The checkin went smoothly and we were being upgraded. The original room is spacious enough yet this time the room made us feel homey. It was clean, the bathroom is also spacious. The sofa was in leather which we love it in consideration of hygiene issue. The hotel pays attention to the safety and healthy of its room guests. We love the bedding and the ambiance in the room. The check out went smoothly as well, with clearly explanation  of all the expenses before we had to check. Everyone we met carried a warm smile. It‚Äôs already the only choice for us when we travel to Singapore! ",5,0.9785
I don't think the problem is completely solved with the hotel yet. I'd like to make a detailed review after a sincere response from the hotel. I am looking forward to hearing a reasonable response from the responsible person.,1,0.8793
The hotel location is perfect. The staff were overall nice. The check in counter is at the fifth floor and the bar at the fifth floor is quite nice. The hotel also has several restaurants and one adjesant mall. Overall good hotel.,4,0.9042
Excellent location. Homely atmosphere. Good food with a committed and caring staff who add value to the hotel. The bed in the premier room could have been better. Honesty of restaurant staff is highly appreciated re: Halal food. Overall very pleasant experience. ,5,0.979
It was a holiday trip but the main reason was to see a lion dancing show on the Chinese New Year day like we did last year. However it was disappointed that the show was cancelled due to a certain reason. Nevertheless we enjoy our trip and the meals that we have had. Thank you.,5,0.8248
I got an executive suite for almost less than a room Probably biggest room I stayed in. What a great value  You are totally pampered and well taken care of from checkin to check out. Great location for shopping and nightlife  I have stayed in Singapore about 8 times. From economy hotels to grand Hyatt. The Mandarin is on par with the Hyatt but a better value. If you stay definitely get use of Meritus club. Great experience ,5,0.9793
"Friendly, helpful, professional, clean, comfortable, home away from home. I felt safe and help was always offered with house keeping and laundry service. The channels on the tv gave a good variety with plenty to choose from in English.",5,0.9612
I was given the old room on Orchard wing while paying the same amount as my colleague who was given the new room on main tower. The room is old and the cupboard smelled bad. No powerplug near bedsides. I stayed at GrandPark Orchard in December and the room was much better at similar price.,3,-0.4215

"Firstly, when my girlfriend and I checked in on 17 January 2020, your staff who politely assisted us with the check-in, did not inform us of the breakfast timing nor venue. My online purchase via Agoda included breakfast, hence it should be expected that your staff provided us with the necessary details, like all other award winning hotels, but that information was not conveyed to us. We checked the dining menu in the room (which clearly indicated the breakfast menu) and thought the timing for breakfast would be the same. We turned up for breakfast on 18 January 2020 and found out the timing was wrong and were very disappointed to miss out on breakfast.  Secondly, there was an error in the room safe and we were not able to store our valuables. It was frustrating to have to wait",1,-0.399

Rooms were large and clean.  Hotel had all the basic amenities.  Breakfast buffet options could have been a little better.  Staff at the breakfast buffet weren't very friendly.  The location is FANTASTIC!,4,0.7957
First time I had been to Singapore. This hotel is in a great location if you like shopping and good food. Room was comfortable with great amenities. Breakfast was exceptional with all anyone could want - good proper coffee as well. Good range of food from the internal restaurants and the many in the mall below and around the hotel. Pretty much all you could ask for.  ,5,0.9805
"Arrived in the evening and was happy to be given a complimentary room upgrade. However, was very disappointed by the amenities in the Premier room.  Had to wait at least 10 mins before the water became hot in the shower.  Was the same problem for the bathroom sink.  Also, the TV programme freezes on you!  Annoying!",3,-0.4361
"central location for shopping, lots of F&amp;B choices, decent bar at lobby.  Disliked ¬∑ We book an executive floor room, but the aircon blower fan is hollowing noisy in the middle of the night. Fail to get any good night sleep and executive floor manager fail to resolve the noisy fans. Although the front office is speedy but it give me a very lame excuse that hotel invoices can't be printed. I am very shock that hotel invoices excuses, especially the hotel made a prior advance payment to my credit card.",2,-0.8365
very central location with excellent service - various breakfast and friendly service at the bar- happy hour recommended. Best way to downtown access at metro station summerset. pool at the hotel hardly used and therefor enough place to relax after sightseeing,5,0.9612
good hotel and comfortable sray. Breakfast buffet is wide and very good spread. Shower in the room is excellent and is one of the best i have used worldwide. Front office( reception) needs to be a bit more professional and customer friendly..didn't like them at all.,3,0.9422

"Location was perfect and room condition can't be better. I was generally satisfied with the service Even, during check-in and check-out, I was so satisfied with gentle service. but feeling racism from concierge guy. He ignored me and my husband, and didn't care at all. only concerning westerners and Chinese. Even, he was yelling to us in Chinese.  I thought he couldn't speak English, before I saw how he treat westerners. So disgusting.. he ruined our good memories from Singapore. It was our honeymoon, he ruined...",2,-0.6005

Even the movement of luggage trolley in the corridor can be heard in the room. People walking in the corridor and speaking there can be easily heard in the room. Sound proof of the room requires urgent attention. The corridor appears unclean and the carpet needs to be changed. ,3,0.4939

" Bad experience at check in, check out . The creation of more than one reception is problematic as I did not know that the corporate check in was at ground floor and was asked to pproach 5th floor. Here they charged 200 GD to my card despite the instruction not to do so. ",3,-0.7269
"We went Mandarin Orchard to stay over the weekend to celebrate my husband‚Äôs birthday. We chose this hotel because it is in the heart of the shopping strip along Orchard Road. It has such an awesome location. We can go back and put our shopping bags and go out again for meals.   The room is big enough to accommodate our family (2 adults and 2 children). They have a shower closet and a bathtub which the kids love it.  Upon knowing it was my husband‚Äôs birthday, they had a little decoration put up for us and even sent a cake up to our room! They also sent extra set of toiletries and towels when they saw that I was traveling with 2 children, without me requesting! How thoughtful of the hotel!  Initial thought of the hotel when I walked along the corridor was that it was rather",5,0.9475
