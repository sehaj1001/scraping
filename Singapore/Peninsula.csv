"I hate leaving bad reviews, but I really was disappointed about this hotel given the cost. The location is good as it is centrally located and close to metro and other major attractions, but the rooms are not impressive. The bed was comfortable. The biggest mistake we made was prepaying for the breakfast buffet. This needs a huge improvement. The food was no better than a Marriott Courtyard hotel. It was pretty obvious the fruit was canned fruit. I highly suggest to save your money and go to one of the many places near the hotel. I also felt like I was being forced to eat at the sky lounge as we were ""given access"". The view is spectacular, but  it's really ""access"" to the restaurant where everything is overpriced.",2,0.9374
"Stayed here for two nights , we have stayed here previously years back and thought our room was tired looking it was quite small but had everything you needed . The staff were helpful even whilst going through the covid 19 crisis. The location is good across the road from the metro station and an easy walk to Clarke quay , sun city and a 25 minute walk to gardens on the bay.",3,0.5859
"Hotel is in a good location. Food court very near. Recommend that guest get access to the Sky Lounge. Nice pool. Reception is on the first floor but this presents no problem.  Thank you to Assistant Duty Manager, Melvin, for ensure our stay was pleasant.",4,0.8587
"My partner &amp; I stayed here for our 3 night stopover on the way home to Australia after a tour of Vietnam.  From the moment we arrived at the check-in counter we felt valued. I'd left my phone on the airport shuttle but they very quickly contacted the shuttle company &amp; I was reunited with my phone within the hour. As an Elite Member, our Deluxe room that we'd paid for was upgraded to an Executive room. It was perfect for us.  It wasn't the biggest room, but it was big enough for us.  The bathroom was quite spacious, with separate bath &amp; shower.  The real feature of the room though was the view.  Our window overlooked the National Gallery &amp; we had spectaular, picture-perfect uninterrupted views of the Marina Bay Sands complex, Theatres on the Bay, the Singapore Flyer &amp; the city",5,0.7814
"Great location from all the Area, that's why it has City Hall MRT, Friendly and helpful staff make your trip worthwhile at reception like (lifeng) . Hotel is bit old, but if can be renovated than, will be key prime property in Singapore. If you happens to be lucky like me to get the MBS view,  than you have beautiful view from your room. Staff is always helpful to understand what exactly needed, they will take extra step to make it happen. I happens got offer to club floor and was delighted by happy faced girl Vasanthi providing the needed items in the room (if not available).",5,0.9877
"I am always mindful of the price of the hotel when writing a review and in view of this find that this hotel  surpassed expectations. It is literally on the main square within walking distance of Raffles etc, 1 minute from the subway and next to a great  food centre, where one could find ample choice of the freshly prepared delicacies Singapore is famous from.  Lovely rooms, lovely swimming pool, very good value.",5,0.9611
Our stay at Peninsula Excelsior Hotel Singapore was above and beyond our expectations..I want to say thank you to Vivian and Vasanthi to take the time and bring personally celebrated my birthday with a amazing presentation of a slice of cake to my room. Highly recommend Peninsula Excelsoir Hotel. Must mention the view is breath taken..just love it❤️,5,0.9583
"Having read some of previous comments I thought even before I entered the hotel that it would be terrible.. And yes my first ""deluxe"" room made all my worries come true :(.. The room was very small, the bed hard and I looked as if I saw stains everywhere.. Sio I went to the front-office and Mr. Khairi took a good look in his available deluxe rooms and was able to give me smooth transfer to a deluxe room at the front-side of the hotel and this room was excellent! beautifull look at the Marina.. This made my 4 day stay very pleasurable and I am looking forward to return to this overall a little bit dated hotel.. time for an overall overhaul of the hotel.. :)",4,0.9421
"Moved to this hotel after disappointing stay elsewhere. Booked a club room and was given a room on the 22nd floor next to the club lounge. The reception staff were efficient and helpful. The room was spacious and had a large window with a view of The Marina Bay hotel. Many thanks to the sky lounge team, Ariane, Vivian, Liying, Vasanthi and Mahrane who made by birthday an unforgettable experience. If I return to Singapore I will certainly stay here again.",5,0.7717
"We arrived after 2 days travelling due to storms in UK  After getting our rooms showering putting on lips we staggered to eat something Down to the restaurant in a ‘mind of it’s own lift’ we reached the restaurant where we came back to life!! Meal beautiful ...squash soup and Chocolate  lava with ice cream  Mmmmmmmmmm The service was good ,the waiters full of humour and the surroundings very pleasant Then up to 27 th floor to see a magnificent view of Singapore at night...what a feast for the eyes...lights every where But the rain poured down so we hastily retreated from balcony and into bed sleeping 13 hours..phew we are human today",4,0.9606
"most disappointing was that money was stolen from the hotel room and the staff did not report the follow up until checked with the reception staff. around S$200 was taken from the bag left in the room while the guest went out.  the hotel staff explained that after investigation only the cleaning staff &amp; hotel guest entered the room. so who took the money?  the response to simply claim from insurance is unsatisfactory. this means the hotel staff know that there is no way hotel guests can prove the money was stolen by staff so they can continue stealing without any penalty by the law.  this is terrible. would not recommend this hotel to anybody else.  the room size and toilet etc is a standard hotel, aircon is very cold in the room and the thermostat seems to be not working or",1,-0.9554
"I'm writing you this review for the wonderful service experience me and my friend had with Farah from Craft bistro on 29 Jan 2020.  We were wandering at the lobby area deciding where to settle our dinner. Farah was alert and and spotted us. She was very patience in answering all our queries. During our dining, she was very attentive to us and her warmth hospitality made us feel very welcomed.  As it was raining heavily and we couldn't get to outdoor for our puff, we approached Farah for the nearest indoor smoking area.   She was quick to act upon our request and allowed us to use the club house balcony which was meant for hotel’s guest upon checking with the club manager.   We were impressed by Farah’s excellent customer service who went the extra miles for us.   Research has",5,0.967

"The room is tight, old and ....the most disappointed is.....dirty!! The desk and sofa are dirty, the bed is very wet and the bathroom seems never be cleaned. It ruined my holiday.  I like this garden city but I will never choose this hotel. 4 star hotel? Are uou kidding me?",1,-0.448
Great location but room is rundown and old. Stains on the wallpaper and some furniture. Elevators took forever. At one point the queue started from outside the lobby. Breakfast was decent. Time for some rennovation.,3,0.4019
The hotel is located in the center of the city. We would like to compliment the Sky Lounge team especially Vivian and Vasanthi for their service and kindness. The Sky Club is located on the 22nd floor with beautiful view of the city and very quiet atmosphere.,5,0.91
"1- The lobby is level 5 and there was only 2 small lifts - you needed to wait for a lifetime to get out of the hotel or go to breakfast  2- The rooms were extremely small, so if you had a child with you, it would feel like we were on top of each others at all time 3- The wardrobe was so small, we could not even put one thing in it 4- The bathrobes were see through and stained 5- The Bed was so hard, forget getting a good night sleep on it 6- The room blinds does not close properly, so forget it if you wanted to sleep past 7am 7- The bathroom was so dirty, we demanded that it needed to be re-cleaned so we can actually use it and the bath curtain stunk  8- The flour we were at  (15th flour) it stunk of smoking, and people just having a jolly good time our of their rooms  9- We",1,-0.4268
"We stayed at the hotel as part of a Singapore Air stopover package arriving on the morning of New Year’s Eve. The day may have had a bearing on the service which was almost nonexistent. There was very clearly no chance of getting into our room a moment before the official 2pm but the hotel did take our luggage. When we finally got into the small room it was old and more tired than us! The sheets and bathroom were generally clean but that was about as good as it got. The air conditioning had two working settings, freezing or off. Most definitely would not recommend staying here.",2,0.7198
"I was looking for a central base in Singapore so that I could check out lots of different sights by the bay and further afield They don't come any more central than this one. It was so handy for being able to take the MRT from City Hall station. If you're like me and a hotel is basically just a place to sleep so that you can explore by day, this place is superb and has a really affordable price tag. A couple of small problems arose during the stay, and all were quickly rectified by attentive staff. What did disappoint me was the single bed. When you pay for a hotel for a solo stay, you always dream of a nice large bed to spread out and sleep comfortably. Unfortunately, the single bed just didn't quite hit the mark. Staff placed two single beds together, but the bedding was still",4,0.4588
"Went there in Nov 2019. The team did a great job in surprising my daughter as she had graduated from her kindergarten. She loves it so much &amp; enjoyed herself as much as we do. Then, we went there again in Dec 2019 (X'mas Eve). And again, the team did a marvelous job in surprising all of us. The deco is so nice. The team took alot of effort in surprising us especially Ms Ariane &amp; AC. We SURELY &amp; DEFINITELY be back again for our future staycations with Peninsula. Great view on Sky Lounge LVL 22 &amp; an awesome team (Ms Ariane, AC, Vivian). Thanks for making us your family at Peninsula 😍.",5,0.992
"My partner checked in to the hotel and we stayed there for about 3 nights. The first room we were in , we couldn't sleep at night. The room was tiny but still bearable but the toilet was big. The bed was very uncomfortable with every movement felt whenever the other person moved even an inch. Airconditioning was either blowing too cold or not cold enough throughout the whole night, was loud as well so both of us could hardly catch a wink. To top it off, TV was not working though we called 3 times for an engineer to come fix it. They only come end day and said cannot fix,said will come back tomorrow to try again. Really?  We called for a change of room the next day and we moved to a bigger room but very tiny bathroom. Can't have both of both worlds when the room comes at a very",3,0.0027
Smallish rooms. But location is nice as walk to Clarke Quay and also to the Singapore Museum we found good. Mass Transit Railway at City Hall is close by. They also have transfers to and from the Airport. Level 5 is the nucleus of this hotel. Loved Level 5. The problem is that noise insulation is non existent. Did not have good night's sleep.,3,0.8689
"Initially after reading some comments about this hotel, I was quite concerned. After staying for a night during the new year I really think it was great. It was new year eve and the lobby was crowded. The manager at the lift lobby never fail to put on a smile on his face. The front desk staff, Ella, was friendly and accommodating too. Breakfast has quite a variety. Only the house keeping was abit slow. We have requested an extra towel during check-in. After we came back from our dinner, the towel was not there yet. Nevertheless, its a great hotel and I hope to come back again. ",4,0.9631

Very polite employee - wanted to now what kind of beds - room we would like told them,  clerk went to another desk, came back and told us they had a room available and checked us in.

Check in absolutely sucks. Online says check-in after 2pm. Was told to come back at 2.30pm. Queued for 20 mins only to be told that room MAYBE available after 3pm and I have to re-queue again. Wasted good hours of new year's eve queuing. Fantastic.,1,0.1298

"Booked this hotel in early October for a one night stopover for a family of four (kids 9 and 11) en route to a relocation to Australia. We requested an additional bed in the room and an early check-in as our flight arrived at 7am. We received confirmation that the extra bed could be provided. Early check in was subject to availability. We are still sitting in the lobby way past the official 2pm check in time with no room on the verge of requesting a refund. As it is, the hotel is very grubby, tired and run down. Loads of other guests who arrived after us got rooms straight away, including those with families. Truly awful service.  ",1,-0.539

"The hotel lobby is quite confusing as you have to take the lift first before you get there. We arrived about half past twelve but didn't get a chance to have early check-in. Upon waiting, we enjoyed the free refreshments at the lobby quenching our thirst from the hot weather of SG.   We have loads of luggages plus stroller so we asked for a bellboy but we were escorted by a front officer instead. He's quite confused that he took us to the wrong lift before we got to our assigned room. He was very apologetic though and he was talking to us suggesting where to go and where to eat nearby.   Our room was great with a view of skyscrapers but the wifi is very slow which is so annoying. Bathroom is superb we got a nice tub and of course hair dryer is a must! :)   We went for a swim at",4,0.9469
"I stayed in the hotel last week and it was far from my expectation. I feel very cramped in the room. The worst thing was the complimentary Wi-Fi was suck. I called the operator and the phone was not connected and I realized that it only worked with the speaker phone on. I talked to the operator and they directed me to the front desk. The front desk then redirected me to the Operator for assistance. Finally, they asked me to go down to the lobby to get it fix instead of sending someone to my room.  I spent more than half an hour just to make the WI-FI connection work. Then I sat down and turned on the beat-up TV to watch the news! Fine! It got no signal at all. I asked attendant to come and repaired it for me. He fixed it but it stopped working right after he stepped out of the",2,-0.6842
"The only good news about the Peninsula Excelsior is that it is an interesting part of Singapore. However, that is the end of the good news.  The ground floor entrance is small and the two elevators are inadequate for the size of the hotel. Take the lift up a few floors to the lobby which reminded me of an airport... large with no atmosphere.   My room was on the executive floor and had been recently renovated (I guess).  The TV was broken and required 2 visits by the hotel engineer; there were no washclothes and I had to call housekeeping for them.... at 11:30 in the evening after a long flight, I didn't need this.  The next morning I found the hairdryer didn't work so I called housekeeping and asked for a hairdryer. Nothing. I called again, nothing.  45 minutes elapsed and,",1,0.0258

On a more positive note, the concierge were helpful and friendly and the location is very convenient both for walking downtown and reaching the metro.",3,0.662

"We booked through Singapore Airlines, we thought the rates were reasonable, but on arrival and staying in the room allocated, we thought otherwise. This tourist hotel has an overall tired look, the check in staff, not very friendly and to a point, officious. Our room had carpets that needed a good cleaning, the bed was comfortable, the linen clean, however, the bathroom had seen better days. Position of the hotel is good, one can walk to most places of interest like the museum, art gallery, Chinatown etc. Wouldn't stay here again though and would book independently like we did before on our last visit to this amazing city.",3,0.985

"This hotel had a great location, staff friendly, etc. Everything you would expect from a hotel with it's current ratings. However, a word of advise for those who bed comfort is important. Their beds (stayed twice, two different rooms) are HARD - and I'm not exaggerating. I think a campers foam mattress would be softer. If it wasn't for disturbing my husband who was already asleep (he also concurs on this issue), I would have shifted to the window seat! As it was I propped all the spare pillows around my body. I did sleep but had sore hips and back the next day, which I was able to walk off thankfully. I don't know if all their mattresses are the same, but maybe you could make enquiries if this could be an issue for you.",3,0.7956

A small bar tucked away in the corner of the lobby, not everyone has access to the sky lounge.

"What is the first thing we look forward to once we enter into a hotel   - Smooth check-in. Keep aside smooth check-in but if you are faced with RUDE (and may be overworked) staff calling you 'selfish' and showering with all expletives just because you have placed a request? Shocking is the word.   Let me briefly explain the check-in issue we faced. The check in time at the hotel was 2pm. We checked in at around 9.30am. Since this is the first time I was travelling with my senior parent and small kid, I checked-in at the reception and when I conveyed the booking name the staff bluntly told - There is no booking in your name.

Room 1023 excelsior tower, the bathroom grouting and sealant in the shower is disgusting, and the bathroom is very small. The carpet in the room needs a good hoovering.

Booked a premier room, got upgraded to a top-floor executive club room on arrival — Leny was very helpful on check-in; thank you.  On entering the room, it felt rather old-school. Clean and tidy nonetheless. Mattress was comfortable, at least to me. Housekeeping, though quick in answering my requests, needs standardisation: one day there were two flannels, other days there were none; different numbers of bottles of shampoo on different days; one pair of slippers one day and two pairs the other day etc. Breakfast was alright.

The Big Bus tour stop was across the road, then by chance we realised the Big Bus terminal was a short diagonal walk past the WWII Civilian memorial. It is also a short walk to Boat and Clark Quay, Chinatown, Raffles, Canning Hill, Singapore Museum.

Booked into this hotel by an angent as part of a package trip to Singapore and the Maldives. On check with friends we were given room keys to adjoining rooms in the Excelsior Tower. Our friends entered their room but when I opened our door I was facing a very suprised female guest who had been given the same room and just been settling in! Needless to say after apologies I went straight to the hotel reception to express my dismay. No manager on duty but the young lady who dealt with my complaint could not have been more apologetic or helpful. Eventually our friends and my wife and I were given new rooms on a high floor in the Peninsular Tower. Great stay from there on in with later check-out before we had to head to Changi Airport for our flight to the Maldives. Included,4,0.9133
"We stayed here for 5 nights on the 21st floor. The staff are helpful and friendly. There are 2 pools you have access to. The bed we had was very hard but they placed a full size pillow mattress down which made the bed much softer to sleep in. The buffet breakfast was very good with a large variety of Asian and European foods. A large selection of hot and cold dishes as well as pastries. The shower was good but it was a little awkward to get the water to be at the right temperature before you stepped under it. A great start to the day. The MRT (train) station is an easy 50 metres away and transport is so simple to use. The Funan shopping centre is 20 metres from the front door and has eating and shops as well as a 7/11 store.

Hotel is located conveniently in downtown Singapore and nearest MRT (subway) station is nearby. I stayed at newer Excelsior tower at a room which had excellent views over Singapore. Pretty long wait to get checked-in in the afternoon - more staff required?  Room itself was of much better quality than I was expecting for a hotel of this age. Decent quality breakfast offered with some variety.  I truly suggest to make a pit-stop at Sky Lounge at 22nd floor - it offers stunning views over Singapore harbour area.,4,0.9432

And it was indeed a pleasant surprise. I was greeted by Ms Ariane &amp; AC who happened to surprise me with a small slice of cake &amp; birthday song. I was taken aback but at the same time, I really appreciate all the surprises that they have done including decorating the room. My kids love the room as much as I do.

The location of the hotel is very central with easy access to Clark Quay &amp; the Marina. We walked to the Gardens by the Bay which was a pleasant stroll of about 25 minutes.  We also had couple of drinks at the 57th floor of the Marina Bay Sands hotel, which is often seen on pictures of Singapore. Great views, expensive drinks but good vibe. Worth a visit and not too far to walk from Peninsular.  The room we had was fine &amp; comfortable although the bed was quite firm. Breakfast was fairly bland but average.

Overall this is a decent hotel with the main benefit being the location - nearby Clark Quay.

The location is very central so I could walk to the office and the Sky Lounge bar has excellent views over the city, but unfortunately that is where the compliments end.

"After a quick check in procedure, we went up to the room to find ourselves allocated in a smoking room. We both don't smoke so we left the room right away and asked for a different room. They moved us from the 19th floor to the 10th floor and although the view from the room was way less, we were happy with the move. Unfortunately, the new room had two single beds which they have put together. The set up of the outlets and light switches was not designed for this and one light switch was directly behind my pillow. Thanks to this I've woken up multiple times during the first night because I accidentally hit the light switch a few times.  The bed itself was very hard. After the second night we left a note on the bed where we requested for a topper which they placed and made it",1,0.2128

On returning at 1pm, check-in is 2pm, we were allowed to check-in but the process was really slow especially as there was only us in reception. We were also told nothing about the hotel or what was close by, which was disappointing. The person on reception seems like they didn't want to be there and wasn't bothered that we were checking in for the first time.  We were in the Excelisor tower and I was surprised at how small the room was. We had issues both of us having our suitcases open at the same time!

Was a bit surprised by the reviews online but this hotel is great. Great location right in downtown and perfect for people attending the F1.  Rooms are much bigger then others in Singapore and nice and modern in the excelsior tower.  Upon check in I was told there is no double beds unless I want to stay on a smoking floor but after a short 15 minute wait was was available on a non smoking floor.

"We stayed here as part of Singapore Airlines package. After reading all the negative reviews we checked in with  an open view. Front staff friendly enough and our room was adequate for a 2 night stay. The hotel and rooms very tired and dilapidated. The bathroom looked liked it had been very poorly renovated. The shower over the bath worked well but the hand basin took forever to drain. The towels were threadbare and frayed at the edges. Two of the towels on first night had dirty marks on them, not useable. A Buffet Breakfast was part of the deal. It was very average and the staff in dining room were not a happy bunch.

While under $200aud per night, it is still not at the cheap end of the scale, but I was horrified to see the mouldy blind and bath in our bathroom! Surely, removing the blind would be a far better solution than just drawing attention to the problem?!  Friends had booked in the evening before and had a wonderful view of Marina Bay Sands (maybe I was envious) but as we had booked at the same time and the same room type, I called reception for clarification.

Secondly the hard bed and the noise of the roof top bar till 2.00 at morning, couldn't let us sleep well. Thirdly the breakfast was OK but with small variety of things and the room which was the breakfast had damages at the roof.

Luckily the smell was not present in my room. I can't recall if I had inadvertently chosen to stay on a smoking floor. Perhaps it's my fault for thinking that by default I would be given a room on a non-smoking floor. Anyway, I'll be more careful next time. Room was OK. Looked a bit old, but then again this is a rather old hotel and I think in need of refurbishing.

We bought tickets to Garden by The Bay and the Obeservation Deck at discounted price through a vendor there.  No issues with checkin and checkout.  Hairi and others were quick to help with our luggage.  Swimming pools are nice and clean.  Towels available in the gym.

For the first time I was asked plz give cash as collateral even when I had paid for full for my booking in advance.

The room was nice and appeared to be clean, with cleaning service every day. The mattress was a little hard, but I have stayed in other countries within Asia with the similar problem so it might be just different to what I’m accustomed to. The hotel is centrally located with close proximity to the City Hall MRT, walk to Clarke Quay and walking distance to the Singapore Museum.

On arrival at the hotel we were greeted at the registration counter by a less than friendly team member as we had remembered from 8 years ago (not all reception staff had this trait).   The cleaning staff were much friendlier.  When we arrived in room 1431 in the Excelsior Tower we were pleasantly surprised.

We discovered this just before we left. We weren't too concerned but did inform the person at the desk that this had happened. She was not concerned nor apologetic. Fortunately, this was the only time we had experienced this on our entire holiday.   Probably wouldn't stay here again.",3,0.9088
"We enjoyed our stay at this hotel. Lobby was nice and our room was OK and we were given a free upgrade at check-in as an added bonus.  Location is very central with the nearest mrt station just a quick 5 min walk from the hotel.   There's also a currency change place in the complex directly across from the hotel, as well some shops close by offering convenient access to items of need.   Raffles City Mall is very close by, while the hotel is within 15 to 20 min walking distance to Clarke Quay, Chinatown or Marina Bay if you do choose.  Otherwise the strategically located mrt station will provide quick access to anywhere you want to go via Singapore's efficient and world class transit system.   I'd stay here again the next time I visit Singapore, as the hotel is reasonably priced",4,0.9644
"It had been a wonderful and pleasant stay. It was very convenient also as the conference was held in the same hotel. The staff and people are very straight forward and helping in nature. Especially the Manager who sensing our taste for a kadak tea, arranged a special British Tea for us. The amenities are excellent. The hotel is ultra modern and clean. It is also very near to Clark Quay, China town and even Marina Bay Sands is also visible.",5,0.9612
