"Arrived at the hotel early in the morning after a long flight, rooms were ready for us and we had been upgraded.  Reception staff were so helpful and couldn't do enough for you.  Rooms were lovely, spotlessly clean and very comfy.  Reception staff went above and beyond to be helpful, always offering us bottles of water and tea and coffee.  We were only there for one night but I have to say this was a great start to our holiday and I would absolutely without doubt recommend this hotel.",5,0.9574
"This is our second visit to the Scarlet Hotel Singapore and it is perfect for a city break to Singapore. Built in a series of remodelled low rise picturesque older-style buildings from the colonial era, it is very comfortable with stylish decor.  The staff are extremely helpful and courteous.  We dealt mainly with Rozie who looked after us perfectly, helping out  with an additional booking of  a couple of days, and booking taxis etc.  Nothing was too much trouble.  There is a roof top bar which opens at 5.30pm which is a delightful place for cocktails or a light bight to eat.  The hotel  is located in a part of Chinatown which at night is very popular with locals and tourists, with many good restaurants and bars.  The atmosphere is sophisticated but lively!  Downtown is only a",5,0.9675
"Been to Singapore any number of times and never really taken to the place, I was looking for one nights accommodation following a cruise and looked carefully, didn't want to stay in the city centre. I found the Scarlet Hotel and I looked different so I booked it. From the first view, the reception and wonderful receptionist I was sold. The room (with a rear facing balcony) was a treat, I can't say enough about it. When we ventured out into the heritage Ann Siang Hill area we were equally delighted. Lots of coffee shops, bars, restaurants but good quality. At night, the street was traffic was blocked off and the restaurants spilled out into the street. The underground train service was a few minutes and very interesting walk  away and those that know Singapore are aware that",5,0.8963
"What a delightful hotel to stay in, with wonderful friendly staff especially Rozie, always there with a smile and so helpful. A great location, with a good choice of restaurants and bars on your doorstep.",4,0.9738
"Stayed here for one night en route to HK.  My husband had stayed here many years ago when the hotel first opened.  It’s in the heart of Chinatown and well located for restaurants and exploring the interesting streets and old shop houses, most now renovated.   The rooms are very small, some do not have windows so be warned.   We arrived mid afternoon and were checked in promptly.  Unfortunately it transpired that our room was not quite ready - the curtains had been removed for laundering- and were not back in place!   This was dealt with and we were quickly allocated another room, albeit slightly smaller.  The rooms are well decorated with extremely comfortable beds and pillows, and a well kitted out, small, bathroom.  The rooms have everything you need.   The restuarant was",4,0.6984
"The staff and concierge are superb (Leslie and Rose are wonderful). My family and I arrived early and they accommodated us by allowing us to keep our luggage in the room that was ready. They also served us drinks, showed us to our room, and gave us helpful tips about the surrounding area. The hotel is clean, great wifi, and has a beautiful vintage and classy look, with gorgeous chandeliers, mirrors, and antique furniture. The location is excellent - one block from Chinatown and across from a great food court with tons of authentic food options (the Maxwell Food Center); not only do locals eat there, but you can share tables and talk with people about Singapore.  Overall, my party and I were very pleased and impressed with this gem of a hotel.",5,0.9857
"Stayed in The Scarlet Singapore three years ago and was as impressed with the hotel as I was the first time. The location at the edge of Chinatown and a ten minute or so walk to Fullerton Quay by Marina Bay is ideal. Upkeep and service at the hotel are first rate. Special thanks to everyone at Reception, including Nigel, who seemed to always be there with a smile and helping hand. We will return! -Park and Michael",5,0.9601
Fantastic location just on the border of Chinatown but still enjoys a quiet neighbourhood. The staff were always friendly and asked how we were and if we needed any assistance each day. Whilst our room was in the basement we didn’t have any issue with lighting as there was a light well in the ceiling which provided natural light. Room was small - compact  but felt enough. And bathroom was good.  Definitely recommmend if you want to stay in Chinatown. ,5,0.9771
"Very Friendly Staff.  They even provided us with recommendations on breakfast places to consider in the morning.  There was a lot to see within walking distance of the hotel and there were two train stations within 5-10 minutes walk as well.  It was very close to Chinatown but just off the main street so we couldn't here the traffic noise.  The room was good too.  I thinks they may have upgraded us from a room without a window to a room with a skylight.  Don't worry about there not being windows ( I was a little concerned about this aspect prior to arriving, never having experienced it before) as it makes for a very restful sanctuary during the day when escaping from the heat outside.  It does make it hard to gauge what time it is though.  I would stay here again.",5,0.9208
The hotel is lovely and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Great location right near china town to get some good food. It is about a 30min walk to Merlion Park which was a straight road.   The room was clean and tidy. Nice shower and bottles of water also included in the room. ,5,0.9743
Overall Perfect place if you’re keen to explore Chinatown and have a different kind of experience than usual big chain of hotels like Bonvoy Marriott or Hilton.   *Wonderful staff who’s willing to go an extra mile to make your stay comfortable.   Check in Very helpful staff Marcelle assisted me on this. Simple and quick. She will usher you to your room while carrying your luggage bags.   Room We have the room with a window on second floor. The room smelled like it hasn’t been aired out for a while so we left the window opened for a bit. The room was clean. There’s a safe in the room.

"We stayed at this hotel as we spend our anniversary.  We are greeted when we checked in with a glass of ice cold tropical juice. After the check in, we are escorted to our room.   The room is small but comfy.  The room we got has a stand in shower and no bathtub. It has a king size bed and a window. There was some issues with our power but was rectified immediately.   Staff were very friendly and attentive. Kudos to Rozie and Benson who both helped us and gave us places to go to shop and best places to eat. Since Benson is clocking out, he even showed us the way to one of the Kaya Toast place famous in Singapore on his way home. He also showed us one.of the building where there are some displays of old traditions of Singapore during the 19th century.   Rosie and Benson is an",5,0.9407
"The hotel is right by Chinatown and also right by club road which has many restaurants and bars.    The room was clean and average size.   The staff was very friendly and helpful.   We walked everywhere from the hotel.  We did have some people come in at 6am from partying all night and it was loud.   Not the hotel’s fault, but it woke us up out of a sound sleep.  We would still stay there again.",5,0.762
Stayed 4 nights in this little gem of a Hotel in the 'China Town' district of Singapore. A former Mid Victoria Chop House now an agreeable cozy little hotel - I was impressed. Shout out to Rosie the Manager and and her able assistant Macelle who seemingly were ever present and always cordial. RECOMMENDED,5,0.8003
"Whoever had the idea of converting this former street of derelict Chinatown ‘shophouses’ into a hotel did a great job.  You can feel some of the history of the area in this property and it has close proximity to the centre of Chinatown and the excellent Chinatown Heritage Museum.  We asked for a room upgrade at this hotel because we had been warned that some rooms don’t have windows.  However the ‘Executive’ room that we ended up in was extremely cramped and the décor looked tired.  There was no room to store our suitcases to the extent that we had to climb over them every time we got in and out of bed.  Clearly, they accommodate very small executives in this hotel.  The hotel is opposite a food market and construction site.  Consequently, there is noise as every room faces onto",3,0.6486
"We stayed at The Scarlet over NYE and had a pleasant experience. The concept is fantastic: an entire row of heritage terrace houses refurbished and converted into a hotel. The room was on the small side, and though the check in staff was kind enough to accommodate our request for a window, there really wasn’t much of a view to speak of...also, the rogue green light emanating from the smoke alarm was bright enough to be a distraction through the night - but at this price, we couldn’t really fault the place. It does have a real charm, from the lavish lobby to the unbeatable Chinatown location, adjacent to Maxwell Hawker Centre and Club Street, which more than compensated for the blips.",4,0.5873
"Had a very nice welcome, the person in the reception walked me to my room, showed the amenities while giving me cote's information. Did not interact much, but staff always courteous  The room was great for Singapore standards, I stayed on an Executive room, only complaint light leaking into room at night, but that's a personal thing. I prefer total blackness in order to sleep I checked out earlier and kept my suitcase at hotel. I came back and I was offered complementary shower! I never had that before. Machelle was wonderful, she booked a grab taxi and waited with me until the taxi came and she even waited to say good bye outside the hotel door, I never that happened except some places in Japan",5,0.9732
"We stayed at The Scarlett for 4 night in November and had a very wonderful stay prior to our wedding. All the staff were very helpful specially Leslie, Rosie and Emily for all the support when my partner had an injury. Thanks you for your wonderful hospitality and we hope to see you again when we are back in Singapore.",5,0.95
"Booked a room for New Year’s Eve. Check-in was uneventful, our booking said welcome drinks but none were offered. We asked for information about the bar and the concierge told us to go to the 4th floor to ask...  the room was nicely decorated. The bed was comfortable but the bathroom stunk! Not sure if there’s a plumbing problem in that room(225) but the smell of rotten eggs was everywhere in the bathroom . In the morning, we woke up to 2 cockroaches wandering our room... nice morning touch . There is not reason for this hotel to not have a robust pest control system. There was no food in our room...   Checkout was worse then checkin. The lady didn’t ask us how our stay was, just said have a nice day Not sure if the horrible service was due it being New Year’s Eve and day but",2,-0.9206

"Both my fiancé and I loved this hotel. The location was perfect and only 200 meters to the nearest MRT. The hotel was beautiful and celebrated their historical heritage.  We were very impressed with the friendly staff and the cleanliness of our room. The bed was a little hard, but the staff gave us a couple of duvets to make it softer.   We will definitely return to this hotel. ",5,0.9371
"we stayed here our last two nights after a 17 day cruise from dubai the hotel was very nice set in old china town very close to shopping and some good street food  we stayed in a room with a large balcony over looking the street ,the room was old but still well looked after  the front staff upon arrival were very friendly and accomodating for sure   Singapore is not a cheap city so be prepared for breakfast costs and other attractions that cost far more than one can imagine but all in all we had a pleasant stay and would stay again because of its proximity to transit and things",4,0.9757
"Loved the concept of this hotel being a heritage property above a row of shops. Great location close to lots of fab restaurants and bars, the Maxwell Road hawker centre and Chinatown.  Our room was very small and it was difficult to store our luggage. But it was comfortable and had everything we needed.  Nice touch that we were able to use the shower facilities before heading back to the airport for our flight.",4,0.9393
Amazing boutique hotel. Super close to Chinatown and walking distance to many other sites. Lovely rooftop restaurant and bar to relax in after a busy day exploring. Highly recommend. Room 202 was spacious and had a balcony with double doors.,5,0.9531
"Great location, easy access to 2 tube stations and walking distance to most things anyway. The room we were in didn't have a window which was a pity, because otherwise it was perfect. Reception staff was helpful. We didn't like the smell at reception, some sort of deodorant which didn't smell nice at all. Other than that happy with the choice. ",4,0.911
"Having arrived at the Scarlet rather earlier than the official check-in time from a long and tiring flight from London, I was able to take advantage of the 24/7 shower facilities at Soda (the hotel's spa area) to freshen up ahead of my room being available.  It was my third stay at the Scarlet, and - as with the previous times - the Executive room was super clean and very comfortable.  There are numerous excellent eateries (including Michelin-starred and Michelin Bib Gourmand ones) within a short walk of the hotel.   A big thank you to Emily and her colleagues for their superlative customer service throughout my 2-day stay at the Scarlet.",5,0.9545
"The front desk lady (Rosy/Rosie, don’t know the exact spelling) was not helpful at all when i ask to borrow an umbrella because my cab was arriving soon. She refused to even check for any available umbrella but insisted i walked back up to my room to get it. Instead it was a inhouse guest/tourist who helpfully offered me his umbrella.   The aircon in the room was not cold enough despite tuning to the lowest temperature. ",3,-0.0557
This is the perfect base to explore Singapore’s China town. Love the attention to detail. Love the extra items supplied. Excellent base to explore China town for shopping and eating. The street in from of the Scarlet is a one way street. ,5,0.9501
The Scarlet was a very clean &amp; quiet hotel at the edge of Chinatown. Plenty of places to eat &amp; drink nearby. Good base to explore from. Staff very friendly especially Machelle on reception. We were offered chance to shower and freshen up as we arrived a few hours before our room was ready. Recommend to stay here if want away from standard hotels. ,4,0.9402

"Stayed for 2 nights to watch the U2 concert. We chose this hotel based on recommendations and proximity to restaurants and bars.  The hotel is beautiful, really chic and full of character. The rooms are tastefully decorated, the beds comfortable. The staff are amazing and very professional. Will definitely return and highly recommend this hotel.",5,0.9593
We stayed here on a short break en route back to UK from NZ.  Had a lovely time!  Staff were really helpful (special thanks to Machelle) and nothing was too much trouble.  Room was really comfortable and very clean.  Location of the hotel is great too - just a minute or so from the heart of Chinatown and within easy walking distance of the MRT (make sure you have small denomination notes when you go to buy your ticket from the machine).  The area felt very safe and the food in the nearby hawker center was great and not expensive at all.  Have already recommended the hotel to friends and will definitely book again when we go back.  Thanks for a great stay,5,0.9925
"It was my wedding anniversary stay. My husband and I were surprised and touched by the anniversary card signed by the manager and staff. The staff even helped me to trick my husband (I was busy preparing). This place has really friendly and hospitality level was excellent. The place is very nearby to cafes, bars and restaurants and walking distance to Chinatown Point and MRT. Really love this place. Hope to stay again!",5,0.9483
"We went to singapore for the first time and stayed in the scarlet hotel.  Firstly the location is fantastic, in the heart of chinatown around the corner from the Maxwell food centre which is a must visit not just for foodies and not far from the chinatown mrt station. The staff are friendly and very helpful and we were welcomed with a complementary drink which after an 13 and half hour flight was a nice touch.  The room was clean and tiny and the right size for the 2 of us. We visited the roof top bar in the hotel which has a fantastic atmosphere with good Italian food and views.  A lovely hotel and we would definitely come back.",5,0.9843
"The staff at the scarlet have been fantastic and the hotel itself has many services that you might not have thought about, such as the shower room to freshen up before your return trip home.   The room was great, with a free, complementary minibar that was restocked daily (comes with the more premium room).   We would stay again. We easily used the local MRT to get to all of the tourist hot spots and regularly enjoyed walking as the area is stunning and very safe. And if it’s raining, there’s lots to do locally and the staff can get you a cab in less then five minutes.   You won’t be disappointed with a stay at the scarlet. It might even make your holiday.",5,0.9686
"Coming back over and over, tried many different rooms without being ever disappointed (and yes, be advised that lots of them are either tiny or have a skylight instead of a window -if that's a problem for you, don't stay in a heritage district building, go for faceless business hotels elsewhere). Location couldn't be better. Hotel with a real personality, decoration is deliciously ""lil' bit too much"", rooftop bar and outdoor jacuzzi are a big plus at the end of a tiring business / shopping day! A big thanks you to the helpfull staff (Nazir and Jonathan mostly) for going out of their way to send me back a pair of reading glasses!",4,0.7602
The Scarlet Hotel fit our needs this trip to Singapore.  We wanted to move away from the harbour front and Clarke Quay and decided to try this gem in Chinatown and it certainly provided us with a great location and lots to see and do within a short distance.  The rooms are not huge but are large enough for a couple and have all that is expected.  The short walk to the MRT proved very handy and the quiet rooms allowed us to catch up jet lag.  The only short fall is no pool to cool off although there is a small spa.,4,0.1454
"The location is right next to China town, plenty of restaurants and hawker complex. The highlight of the stay at the Scarlet was the staff, thank you Leslie Lee for administering first aid to a bruised and bloodied shin, thank you to Bincy for helping with cases and offering post check out showers. Big thank you to all the other staff who ordered taxis for us, kept an eye out for them, opened doors and general helped where they could. Taxi are cheap and a source of tourist information.",5,0.8779
We had a great stay at Scarlet. We were only there for 2 nights as a part of a layover on the last leg of our trip. But it was in a great location. We didn’t fly out till late the next day so after check out staff held our bags for us so we could continue exploring and allowed us to use the shower services to freshen up before the flight. I really like the decor but some areas do seem like they need a bit of r&amp;r. Some spots of the wall paper are looking a bit worse for wear and it ages the hotel. Otherwise it was very clean and had great staff and amenities,4,0.9449
We  booked our room at the Scarlet after our Air B'nB had some complications and we're glad we did. We didn't arrive until after midnight (nearly 3:00am) and were greeted by two ice cold flutes of juice which was quite refreshing after our long flight. When we woke up we were surprised to see how close we were to Chinatown and there was a Hawker Center right around the corner. The Chinatown subway stop was about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. Would highly recommend and would stay there again in a heartbeat.,5,0.7645
Hotel was convenient for location to areas that I wanted to visit. The guest services were extremely helpful and the staff was very knowledgeable in providing information on the city. I would definitely stay at the Scarlet again for future trips.,4,0.6997

My husband and I stopped in Singapore for one night on our way to Europe but in hindsight should not have bothered as we didn’t get much sleep in the hotel anyway. On first appearances the hotel reception was quite nice but the room was like a dungeon with no windows and so tiny I had about 35cm between the bed and wall. The bed cover was so small it didn’t cover the bed and the pillows and bed were rock hard and the sink clogged up in the bathroom. Terrible experience!,1,0.2788
"Booked a large room (forgot category).  AC was too strong, so I off it but there was still freezing cold.  No drama but their blanket was very thin and I was actually cold.   Main issue was that my room was on a street level and  since the area is full of bars, it was very noisy with drunk people shouting, fighting, breaking bottles etc.   Good service . Staff was always smiling and friendly which in Singapore is not common.",3,0.3949
"My husband and I stayed at The Scarlet for 5 nights during our trip to Singapore. Check in was quick and the staff explained all of the amenities with an added welcome drink. We were in a standard double room which was small but clean and had everything we needed. Location is great, right across the road from a hawker centre, turn right you head in to china town and turn left for club street. For us it was a great base for getting out to explore Singapore. We had a late flight on the day of our check out but we were able to store our bags and use the shower facilities which was great as we could still do some last minute site seeing.

"If you want a one size fits all, multinational cookie cutter hotel experience then this is not the hotel for you. But if you want to experience the heart and soul of Singapore, the you really should consider staying at the Scarlet. Set in the heart of Singapore, the hotel is literally adjacent to vibrant trendy restaurants and bars, frequented by Singapore’s young and affluent. Meanwhile, cross Erskine Street and you’ll find yourself at the Maxwell Street mall, the heart of Singapore’s famous street food culture. And at the other end of Erskine Street is Chinatown with its bustling markets. But that is just the location. The staff and management of the hotel are unbelievably friendly and helpful. You don’t just feel at home, you feel part of the family. They really go out of",5,0.8899
My sister and I stayed for three nights in this gorgeous boutique hotel right beside Chinatown.  Staff are so helpful and made us feel very welcome.  It was my birthday during the stay and they surprised me with chocolates and a birthday card.  Room was very clean and a good size.  Hotel has two great restaurants also. Our only criticism was the location of our room near the neighbouring 7/11 store and street was very noisy in the night.  If we stayed again would request a different part of hotel.,4,0.9634

"I was in Singapore for a night and wanted to book a hotel experience instead of just a 'normal' hotel. I booked The Scarlet and when I checked in Rozie from the front desk team was extremely friendly and welcoming and even upgraded my booking from the standard room to The Passion Suite (the hotel's best room), I even got my own Jacuzzi on the balcony where I sipped a glass of wine under the moonlight. It was such a great room, very boudoir sexy, and I loved my night there. Super friendly staff and I even had a long conversation with the front desk staff the morning I left.  Highly recommend booking in with The Scarlet if you are looking for an 'out of the ordinary' experience in Singapore. Slept like a baby in the bed, had a beautiful hot rain style shower and of course lapped",5,0.9918
"We used to frequent Casa Tartufo (within the hotel premises) when we lived in Singapore and I was intrigued by the hotel. Now as a visitor, I thought I would try The Scarlet for a change instead of going for the usual big hotel names, particularly as I like its location.  We stayed 2x within a span of a week as we went for a short trip in between. I booked the Executive Room for both bookings except the 2nd stay had the balcony.  The rooms are small but I expected that. What I didn’t expect was how the room with the balcony is actually much smaller inside.  It costs more but it’s not worth it unless you really plan to spend a lot of time on the balcony where the view is not even nice. With the balcony, they’ve compromised on the room space.  The room designs are okay although it",3,-0.192
"The hotel is in a row of converted shop houses and could not be in a better position, just a couple of minutes walk into Chinatown where you can get the underground or buses. It is also an easy walk to many of the main attractions including Clarke Quay, Raffles and Marina Bay. The public areas of the hotel are first class and a little unusual however the room was one of the smallest I have ever stayed in. Having said that it was well equipped with just about everything you would want for a short business or leisure stay. Breakfast was a very limited choice but was freshly prepared and very enjoyable. On the last day of our stay it was great to be able to go back to the hotel after a hot day exploring the city to have a hot shower before going off to the airport.",4,0.9386
Due to severe delays from London Heathrow and a diversion to Bangkok we arrived at the Scarlett Hotel very late in the early hours of the morning.  Exhausted and grumpy we were greeted with smiles and help with our luggage. The hotel is clean and comfortable and in a good location but it is the staff that makes it special. Professional and friendly from the receptionists to the porters and concierge they made our brief visit very enjoyable and we will definitely like to return and stay longer next time.,5,0.9771
"Stayed at The Scarlet for four nights, a very well appointed most unusual boutique hotel, positioned close to Chinatown and many bars and restaurants. Marina Bay was a short MRT subway ride away or a steady 25 minute walk if you fancy it. We had an executive room with a balcony which was small but enough for the amount of time we spent in it. The room was beautifully furnished and kept spotlessly clean by our maid. Front desk could not have been more helpful and friendly, a special mention for Nigel who went beyond the call to help us when needed. We would highly recommend this hotel, and would stay here again without hesitation. Sue and Paul Bishop",5,0.9863

The rooms aren't huge but they have everything you need. The bathroom had a good shower and nice toiletries. The gym was small but functional and there was a small hottub too. On departure day, they allow you to leave your bags and then use a shower room when you return to collect them, which was excellent. Good value too given the location. ",4,0.9762
"We spent part of our honeymoon here; we loved that the hotel had a sexy vibe and was unique. The staff were friendly, welcoming and accommodating and decorated our bed with gifts to help us celebrate our honeymoon. The only reason for 4 stars and not 5 was because of a booking error on their part resulting in us missing out on breakfast for 2 out of the 3 days. Although the hotel gave us a bottle of wine to say sorry, we probably would have preferred a partial refund instead (especially as we'd paid extra for an upgrade when checking in).",4,0.9393
The hotel is immediately welcoming with very nice decor! We were immediately greeted with a welcome drink at the reception and the check-in process was smooth.  The room itself was very quiet and comfortable and location was also good.  The staff members were extremely helpful and caring - special thanks to Nazir for immediately making us feel welcome and also for his assistance and also thanks to Rozie who was very willing to share her knowledge with us when we asked for some recommendations.

The Scarlet is a real gem of a heritage hotel. Not a smidge of chrome or artificial swan lines. Just a genuine historical building in the most fantastic location.

"We booked this hotel back in September 2018 for our 6 days in Singapore in July 2019 and so glad we booked this beautiful boutique hotel.  I really can't fathom the bad reviews for this hotel.  We opted for an Executive double room with Balcony, the room was beautifully designed and well equipped and large enough for our short stay following 18 days in Borneo.  We had 2 large rucksacks which were stowed easily in our room, there is a large enough wardrobe to store everything.  The bathroom had a decent sized shower cubicle with a lovely shower, so clean and the toiletries were lovely.

"Stayed here just recently and could not wait to get out of the place. The room was like a dungeon with no windows so always dark and completely dismal. The bed was so hard we couldn’t sleep, the bed covers barely covered the bed and the room so small there was a mere 10-12 inches between the wall and the bed to try to get in and out. The towel rail was inside the shower cubicle so got wet and although I asked for another it was not forthcoming. The attached Italian Restaurant had terrible food. Do not stay here if you want to be comfortable.",1,-0.6552
"What sets this boutique hotel apart is simply this - customer service. Yes, it is very comfortable and yes, it is brillaintly located. Recently my wife and I had a one night stopover booking. We felt like regular, valued customers. Two staff in particular did all they could to make us welcome when we arrived early and checked out leaving our baggage there as we had a midnight flight. Leslie Lee, Assistant Guest Relations Manager and Nazir, Guest Relation Executive gave us amazing personalised service allowing us to gain entry to our room early and then shower before we left to go to the airport. They were excellent communicators and seemed to genuinely enjoy their jobs and making their customers' experiences the best they could be. Other staff we dealt with in small ways were",5,0.9882
I visited the hotel almost 7 hours prior to my check in and the staff at the hotel was very receptive of me. They were overbooked the day I arrived and they made sure I was at home the time I was waiting by them to arrange a room for me. The people working at the concierge were just such amazing and lively people Leslie and Michell,5,0.8402
"My friend and I stayed at The Scarlet for 2 nights. Whilst the rooms are on the small side, it is perfect for a few nights and when out exploring all day. The hotel has an old fashioned and quirky feel but oozes luxury which makes it so unique to Singapore!  The staff were accommodating and extremely friendly - a special mention to Rozie for being so welcoming. We visited Aria rooftop restaurant on our final night in Singapore and although we hadn’t stayed at this hotel for 2 days, we were able to store our luggage safely and relax whilst having dinner. Something which the hotel definitely did not need to do!  The location is great - less than a 5 minute walk from Chinatown, a hawkers food market and quaint street with independent restaurants, making you feel like you are in",5,0.9915
"This boutique hotel is at the heart of China Town, right by the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Amoy Street Food Centre. The hotel is in a row of old shop houses with a real colonial feel. The roof top bar has a nice view. Don't be fooled by the clever use of lighting and mirrors. Many rooms do not have a window and they won't necessarily tell you. It's essential to check when you book.",3,0.8309
My wife and I travel to Singapore at least 3 times per year. We are always looking for good options but I suggest giving this one a miss. The rooms are small as are the beds. It is run down and unclean. The location is average with access to the China town area across an uncontrolled busy road. The staff were disinterested. Be careful of the hidden penalty charges is small print on the check in forms - $200 is a significant and unwelcome surprise after you leave. Overall very disappointing.,1,-0.8702

"This is a beautiful boutique hotel in a great location. It's situated in Chinatown with a 5 min walk to China Food Street and behind the hotel are a few nice bars. There is a 7 Eleven at the end of the hotel and a few shops situated at the front of the hotel exterior.   My room was a good size, clean and quiet. Staff were very friendly and helpful both at at check in and check out. The hotel itself is nice with a rooftop restaurant and a hot tub available to guests. I would definitely come back!",5,0.9813
"This was my second stay with Scarlet this year. I was so impressed with my first short stay I came for a longer stay to explore Singapore more. Due to an issue with my requested room I was advised in advance and generously upgraded to a Premium room with a bath and that as nice to soak the day away.  The staff are very kind and professional and it was great to meet some of them.  It’s awkward to say, but breakfast wasn’t up to scratch, BUT in saying that, the hotel are so caring they hopped straight onto the restaurant tenant to rectify the teething problems of transitioning to a plated breakfast service. I stress here the breakfast is provided by the restaurant, not the hotel, but were keen to make sure it was up to standard for guests.  We felt very looked after by all the",5,0.942
"We had 3 nights at the scarlet hotel in august. the location was great - right in chinatown and very close to the bus stop for the hop-on hop-off bus. Plenty of restaurants near by. The staff were helpful and kind, though we didn't really have much to do with them other than check-in and check-out. The rooms however are very small, only just enough space for the two of us. We had an executive balcony room. There was nowhere to put the suitcase other than on the bed or right in the doorway. The room seemed to have an un-functional layout.  I think the location is just enough to recommend that people stay here, given we spent so little time in the room - just there for sleeping and thats it. However if you planned on spending extended time in the room, maybe choose a different",3,0.8836
"Found the hotel online and liked the look/sound of it. And what a find. It more than met my expectations and the high standards I look for when travelling. The hotel is housed in 1880's shop houses and is a fabulous blend of heritage and modern.  The bedroom was huge and beautifully appointed (it lacked nothing), with a very comfortable bed.  A bonus was the mobile phone provided for personal use, including free international calls, and preloaded with apps useful for a visitor to Singapore.  The hotel is very well located, especially for exploring Chinatown, and the fantastic Maxwell hawker centre is just across the road.  The staff are super friendly and helpful, especially Jonathon, who kindly arranged a late checkout for me and access to shower facilities later in the day",5,0.9923
"We stayed at this hotel a few years ago and it was amazing but our return visit was a disappointment. It is in a great position in Chinatown and within a nice walking distance of downtown Singapore about a slow 30 min walk about 45 min drive from the airport. There are loads of great looking restaurants within walking distance of the hotel if you want to stay close and there is a nice rooftop terrace serving food and drinks/cocktails. There are two MRT stations fairly close if you don't fancy the walk. The hotel lobby is amazing when you walk in, bold colours and deep velvet chairs and beautiful chandeliers. The staff are very helpful and knowledgeable about the city and will do anything to help you in anyway they can. Our first problem was that we had booked a deluxe room at an",3,0.9901
This hotel is awesome and the location is super. Next to Maxwell food market and other shops in the area. The breakfast was very limited. Still would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in a luxury hotel,5,0.8862
The Scarlet was positioned well in Singapore's Chinatown area. The staff looked after us well. Close to subway train system MRT and transport options were easy. Plenty of choices for restaurants in the area.,5,0.7269
We enjoyed staying at the Scarlet for a quick layover in Singapore.  Good hawker center across the street.  Pleasant to walk around Chinatown at night and check out the bar scene around the corner.  The rooms were quiet and the staff lovely.  Great breakfast with western and Chinese options.,5,0.9545
"Fabulous location. Room was very suitable. Glad we booked here over our first chosen hotel. First two days staff didn’t service room properly but when queried, it was promptly amended each day after that. Reception staff didn’t always go out of their way to greet - but generally the service was very good, prompt and friendly. I would stay here again and recommend for a suitable 4 star stay. A pool would’ve been good as the weather was super hot each day but frankly we were so tired sightseeing we probably wouldn’t have used it! ",5,0.9749
"The hotel staff couldn't be happier to see you and are extremely helpful. The breakfast is an eclectic mix of European and local food which is an interesting change, but you soon come to enjoy it! Very clean and sparkling. A lovely relaxing place from which ChinaTown is very easily accessible. It is a great location and has a unique style of its own. Great hotel, excellent staff.",5,0.9933
"I booked this hotel for my parents who love boutique hotels and they loved it. Amazing location.  Fantastic staff .  Beautiful rooms.  Bathroom is quite a decent size which is unusual for a small place. Aria Rooftop bar and restaurant is also attached via the internal lift, which was a plus  On the down-side, the rooms are very small. With 2 big suitcases my folks were struggling for space. just one person though? perfect  NB: some people warned that not all rooms have a window so i booked one with a balcony. the balcony was quite big actually.",4,0.9648

"The Scarlet Hotel feels homely the moment you walk into the foyer. We loved the character of the decor, the exceptionally friendly and helpful staff and the great location. We were easily able to walk to most things and other places were no more than a couple of stops on the city’s unbelievably efficient metro. The bed was super comfy, the room spotlessly clean and we had the benefit of a jacuzzi right outside our door. Others on here have commented on some street noise but we actually found it to be incredibly quiet. A great place to stay and good value by Singapore standards. ",5,0.9799
"Due to its Low-rise building structure, it might be disturbing to have all the noises made by the traffic directly outside of the hotel 24/7. However it has excellent staff especially Leslie whom gave us an room upgrade and free breakfast due to a booking error that I’ve made. Overall 4/5!",4,0.3164
"At the end of the day, it's clean rooms, decent space, reasonable access to transport and eateries that you need. And the Scarlet does provide it, but at an exorbitant rate. Or so I felt. I stayed 2 nights there and everything was ok. The front desk staff (Jonathan especially) was very helpful, trying to get me an early check-in, helping me with eating recommendations etc.  It's a good hotel but frankly over priced.",3,0.9376
"This hotel is perfect for business travels, close to downtown so you can easily get to the office; and close to chinatown so you can find some nice street food in the evening. I do recommend and will get back there next time I'm in Singapore! And they have nice outside jacuzzi as well :) ",5,0.9575

"We spent 3 nights on the top floor (3rd floor) during our stay in Singapore. We chose The Scarlet Singapore for it's combination of location and price. We would not stay here again.  To get to our room from the elevator we still needed to climb an additional 6 to 8 stairs. Our room was very small, but adequate. On our second night, the electricity was out on the entire 3rd floor when we arrived back at the hotel. We had to use our phones to see the stairs in the dark and find our way to our room. Electricity was on and off all night that night, going out again every couple of hours. That meant no air conditioning, which is vital for us in hot, humid climates. When the electricity went out, we would have to phone the front desk in order to have someone resolve the issue. Though",2,0.7612
Rozie very helpful at the front desk.  Didn’t realize how big the hotel was.  Small gym but good enough to get a workout in.  Many shops easily walking distance and bars.  Jacuzzi area small but worth hanging out in if no one else is there . ,5,0.8199
This is a nice clean hotel right next to china town . I also thought it was good value for money my room was a nice size bed was comfy and WiFi was good . The jacuzzi was a nice place to relax after a lot of walking round the city ,4,0.9648
"Stayed in Scarlet 4 nights! Entrance and reception is absolutely outstanding, welcome drink was a nice touch too! However, rooms are small but functional. We had the little balcony and jacuzzi was just outside our room. We thought it will be great, but had very loud guests having fun in the middle of the night, so the sleep was really badly disturbed. Staff tried their hardest to get loud guests out, but it took them 1h and also police was involved. Jacuzzi didn’t smell good, so we only tried once. The other thing to mention is deposit. Even after more then 20 days stay my deposit is still not back onto my account. Contacted 3 times, but been told should be in my account in 7-14 days. Didn’t happen. My bank can’t do anything but wait, so frustrating. Stayed in other 2 hotels in",3,0.7718
"As someone else has reported, the taxi driver from the airport did not know where it is.  The front door says 'Scarlet' on the floor but the sign that's visible from a car next to it says something different.  Once entering, the whole place has an air of slightly off-centre sophistication.  Certainly there is plenty of red, including the hallways between rooms, but there are also lots of adornments that somehow don't quite not work.  The room itself was clean and though not the biggest, had enough space for a short business stay.  The bathroom was a reasonable size, the air conditioning worked well.  There were quite a few nice touches such as an umbrella to use on rainy days, and a 'personal assistant' (a smart phone that can be taken with you whilst you stay to give tourist",4,0.954

The floors to the rooms are uneven which didn't bother me, but might not be ideal for those with mobility issues. My room was spotlessly clean, beautifully decorated and well appointed with nice bath products, a mini fridge and the coziest bathrobe and slippers. They are building an MRT station nearby, but I never noticed any extra noise during my day, and it was a very quick walk to the famous Maxwell Food Centre for lunch. Would happily stay here again.

"The pictures look more inviting than the real thing. We generally look for smaller boutique hotels but this one let us down compared to others we’ve stayed in in Asia   The outside still has the old fashioned look but inside was dark with teeny tiny rooms. Nice colours &amp; all, just small &amp; claustrophobic. We did have a teeny balcony but fit only one person at a time.  The lobby &amp; all the staff we encountered were very nice &amp; the position is very handy to Maxwell Hawker Centre &amp; Chinatown.  The best thing we found though was a little bar (just up to the corner &amp; left down to a blue building) on the roof &amp; behind Scarlet.  It was so cute with the best cocktails made with flavoured teas. Superb!! Only one other thing to mention too is the outstanding brekky at this hotel. So good",4,0.9944
"The airport taxi driver had no idea where it was, but I did – in Erskine Road, just off South Bridge Road, in Chinatown. The entrance suggests either a casino or an up-market escorted karaoke bar – gold, black sparkling granite, crimson.  The street level front of the hotel comprises the original (more or less) shophouses, which means that the ground-floor rooms lack any daylight (there is a tiny skylight, perhaps to satisfy some technical regulation, but it admits neither light nor sky).  This is useful if, as I was, you are keen to readjust your body clock to some other time-zone. Otherwise it is a bit oppressive.  The room was perfectly well-appointed and decorated in a traditional, if slightly tired,  kind of way, with a good-sized bathroom, and the bed was comfortable. ",3,0.9656

Luggage space was a bit of a problem.  There was a nice rooftop bar. And the service from the employees in the lobby was terrific.

However, it then transpired that the restaurant was not open for the whole of my stay, there was no room service and the only possibility of spending money on “incidentals” was two cans of coke in the fridge!

"I embarked on a 3 week European holiday and started with a stopover in Singapore. After some research, I was drawn to Scarlet for her sense of individuality and style.  Scarlet did not disappoint.  A lovely warm welcome (even at midnight) and a beautiful room. I decided to kick my trip off in style and selected an elevated Executive room (237). The room was immaculate. Clean and very comfortable. Moreover, plenty of room to move and such attentive staff to look after you, I was quite at ease from the first moment. Everyone was helpful with local tips and things to see and do. It was my first time in Singapore and find I am returning there for a birthday in July. I was so impressed, I have already booked a return stay with Scarlet. Ensure you choose a rate with breakfast included",5,0.9766

So we were booked in a room with one queen size bed. I am not a quiet sleeper so it will be a problem with my colleague. The hotel manager, Leslie was kind enough to offer us to change our room if there is an available one, unfortunately, all the rooms were booked. But Leslie can work wonders and luckily he found a room with two beds and not only that, iit was a suite. This make our stay more memorable and I highly recommend the Scarlet hotel Singapore for your next visit to Singapore. It is also near the Maxell food center, yummy Sinagaporean food.",5,0.8313
"Great location if wanting to explore Chinatown.  Staff welcoming, helpful and informative.  Rooms small and in our case the decor was a little tired.  Bed hard but comfortable if not a little small for people of above average height.  Shower strong and lots of room but no fan and damp patches on the ceiling.  My main concern was what might happen if there was a fire.  The hotel is made up of old terraced houses that have been knocked through to make a hotel.  A single corridor runs through the buildings and in the event of a fire it would act like a wind tunnel.  We were on the third floor and while there was adequate emergency stairs you couldn’t help but feel it would be hard to evacuate in the early hours should that potential wind tunnel fan the flames in an old building.

It is surrounded by great bars, restaurants and easy walking to many attractions - Maxwell hawker centre, Chinatown, Marina bay, shopping malls and more.   Unfortunately the hotel was a let down in a few areas.   1. Room size, we were upgraded which was lovely. Unfortunately the executive room we were given was tiny. Too small for two people. As we were traveling for three weeks we had two cases and carry bags. There was just no room to store things. I completely get that the hotel is converted from shops and the size comes from this. With that in mind I would recommend to single travellers.   2. Avoid breakfast. We had it included in our booking. There is not a good selection.
