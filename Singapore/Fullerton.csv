"I booked a night at Fullerton to celebrate my mother's birthday. Decided to splurge a little since my trip to Austria in May turned to ashes.   Check-in was smooth and we were given a room upgrade. One of the staff personally showed us to the room and also informed us that the room was newly refurbished. The room was a pleasant upgrade with a view of the quay and was nicely decorated with balloons and a slice of cake (a thoughtful gesture indeed) in view of the occasion. If case you are wondering, you would have no issues watching Netflix as Chromecast is available :) There's also a nice big tub to fulfil any bath bomb fantasies.   We headed to the courtyard for high-tea after putting down our things. The club room is closed due to Covid-19 (a bit of a pity) and the high-tea and",5,0.9169

"We stayed at the Fullerton Hotel as a stopover in Singapore, en route from New Zealand to London. What a fabulous colonial style hotel this is, the staff are excellent, friendly, efficient and knowledgeable of their city. The Hotel was the old GPO office and government buildings during its colonial life, once the busiest in Asia. It‚Äôs had an amazing renovation into the city‚Äôs best hotel, we‚Äôve been to Raffles, and the Fullerton is better. The public areas are huge, immaculate and spotlessly clean, so are the bedrooms, we had room 603 on the front of the hotel, facing the marina area, fantastic views, and a lovely room. It‚Äôs probably in the best location for visiting all the attractions, and a few minutes walk to the MTR. We would recommend the Fullerton to anyone visiting",5,0.9927
"The Fullerton hotel offers the best value for money in top end accommodation.  Location is perfect for on foot travel: Boat Quey, Merlion park, Raffles city, China town, Marina bay, Sands, Gardens by the bay.  Easiest spot in town to hire a taxi. ",5,0.9313
