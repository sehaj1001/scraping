"Originally planned for a 2D1N staycation but extended it to be 3D2N. Had a great time cycling by Changi Beach and enjoying the various eateries. Would love to explore Ubin if we had more time.   The breakfast buffet is quite small but sufficient. Friendly &amp; helpful staff around.   Swimming pool was pleasantly warm. Despite the breeze, the water wasn't freezing like some other hotels that we've been at.   Overall, a simple staycation while celebrating my husband's birthday. Had a wonderful family time!",4,0.9921
"My wife and myself had another very pleasant stay at the hotel. I think this is our fourth stay and it didn't disappoint. The location is very good, close to sparsely occupied clean beaches, nature trails, local and international food outlets. A welcome change from the bustle of Clarke quay. The staff in the hotel are very pleasant and helpful, with a special mention to Benjamin and the staff in the club lounge. I would recommend taking advantage of the club lounge as this gives you a chance to meet fellow travelers and exchange experiences. The hotel also offers other bonuses such as late check-out and shuttle services to the airport and city. Hopefully we'll be back in later this year for another pleasant stay.",5,0.9895
"Book a Deluxe room, requested for smoking room and advice that this reservation was a birthday celebration for me. We managed to get a smoking room on Level 4. A little disappointed with the room as it was not as clean as the other reservations we made at this same hotel. The hair dryer was not working too , the bed was squeaky when you get on or off the bed. Furthermore it looks like no cleaning has been done for some time under the bed.  Now, we do wonder if we should ever come back here for another gateway or maybe it's time to go somewhere else for our gateway.",3,-0.581
Overall this location is splendid with eating facilties readily available. Changi beach is nearby and overall service is good. A setback is the free access given to members of public as the card readers in the lifts are not working. This allow any members of public to go to any levels. Safety and security are compromised,4,0.9265
Nice hotel with good roof top swimming pool and kids pool downstairs next to the restaurant. Nice quite area with a nearby park and possible trips to Pulau Ubin. Breakfast was good and stocked up without any shortage at any moment we were there ,4,0.9176
"Will update name in future, was told to wait for king size bed but the staff asked me wait for half hr n I m ok but when I return he ask mi wait for another half hr n I waited too but wait till halfway he went off without informing me n I hv to go to the counter n asked another staff then she say yes the rm is ready . Got another bad experience with another staff during previous too",3,0.5927
"Everything was great except the food at salt water. I love the gym, the location, the service but the breakfast was not up to standard in my opinion. I would recommend the hotel for the overall experience but you would do a lot better by skipping the meal and heading to changi village food centre for your meals. ",5,0.9052
"The location may not be in town but it's the airport and it's a relaxing place with easy access to food and other necessities.If you would like to explore nature, you can hop over conveniently to Singapore's offshore island, Pulau Ubin.",5,0.9081
"Room was not available at check-in time. I booked a Queen room but it was not available and front desk didn't try very hard to help me find one. He just allocated a 2 single bed room to me and said housekeeping will put the two beds together. However, houeskeeping never came. The phone was spoilt so I couldn't call room service, housekeeping and front desk at all. There were holes in the blankets. TV reception was poor. Wifi was slow and patchy. The wireless@SG at the nearby food centre was stronger than the hotel wifi.",3,0.6078
Hotel was OK but staff efficiency at counter should be improved as we took more than 30 min just for check in. The swimming pool was all right but water looks abit murky so we didn't enter the pool. The staff were friendly generally. ,3,0.9283
"If you prefer to stay out of Singapore city center this is a nice alternative, close to Changi airport. And with free shuttle bus to the airport. Friendly and helpful staff, Clean room, comfortable bed, Infinity pool++",5,0.9524
"The hotel is a little frayed around the edges but the staff were pleasant and the room was clean and a fair size. Breakfast was disappointing, particularly the limited choice of either black coffee or tea.   Location is good for getting around.",3,0.8286
"My third time here for a staycation. Allowed us an early check-in since room was available. Room is big and clean. Realised the hotel has made changes to the free bus to the airport. Pick up from airport is now clearly indicated at terminal 2, which is an improvement since it was not specified the last time I stayed. Pick up is now consolidated at terminal 2, stops at T1 and 3 were scraped. We don't mind anyway. We came back because we love the location. Walking distance to Changi village, loads of good food. Near Changi Point Ferry Terminal to Pulau Ubin.   Nevertheless the walls were pretty thin. We can hear our neighbours...but since I use ear plugs its fine but for people who dont they may have a hard time sleeping. ",4,0.875
"Came here for 1 night staycation, room is clean and everything is okay. We were given twin bed even we booked a deluxe room. Called reception to ask if we could change to King Bed, and they sent the housekeeper to help joint the bed and put on new bed sheet and duvet. We were okay with that. We were given connecting room, 1.15am we were asleep and woken up by the guest next door talking on phone with VERY LOUD SPEAKER! Hope he will hang up the call, but even after 20mins still same. Called to the receiption to complain and staff told me will action. We were trying so hard to get sleep. Hoping to get a relaxing and recharging staycation,but disappointed.",2,0.6813
"Wonderful family experience at Village Hotel Changi, great hospitality offered by staff especially to Ben and Lynn for remembering my birthday celebration .Hope we will get another chance to come back again. Thanks!",5,0.9422
"From the get go, it was a good experience. Alvin, the staff at the front counter, was very friendly and accomodating. The rooms were nice and facilities were well maintained. Will definitely come back again!",5,0.9229
"The stay in Changi V hotel was a great and memorable one. The check in service is fast, the staff are friendly. The surrounding is full of good food and peaceful ambience not to mention the swimming pool at Level 8. It is a must to watch sunrise there. ",4,0.9246
"The price is worth for staying.The room is clean and comfortable.Only thing to be improved is the room service, the tel phone for room service is not working.we have to go down to main hall to ask for service, when we asked for additional blanket, it took four times we finally received the blanket. ",3,0.7717
"My friend introduce me to this hotel aa she went before and she mention that it was good, so at a point of time the hotel had a member offer price at only $99 which is super cheap!  Booked 2 day 1 night, went to the infinity pool at level 8 (view was awesome ) the rooms are super spacious, bathtub, WiFi all good the bad part is the soundproofing of the walls are too thin. We can hear people voices just by them walking pass by. Overall a super good place. Location wise is very good, there's famous changi hawkee food center with alot of yummy food, nearby there's park and to pula ubin!! Also opp the hotel there's a club for people who want to sing karaoke, play bowling and etc. Will go there again! ",5,0.9895
"Hotel is 20 minutes from the airport, a cheap taxi ride. Enjoyed the location, despite airport proximity there was no noise. Had a nice clean room, well appointed, big bed, ample bathroom. Friendly staff.",4,0.8979
I go for value over money. I got issue on reservation about late check out which you charge me of 60sgd even I called your center to help me out. This was so inconvenience and not transparent. I even called your center about this but never called back. ,5,0.1102
"A beautiful hotel with excellent service. We enjoyed the club lounge access and a clean, large room. The location of the hotel is perfect for coastal walks, beach walks, and exploring the delicious food Changi Village offers. ",5,0.9682
i was quite impress my previous stay with this hotel but this weekend staycation experience was a bad one. first it started off with the check in process which was slow and as a local resident i was being prioritize the lowest and the tourist got served first this happened when i check in at 4 pm which is way beyond the standard check in hours there was no check of my temperature at any point of time during check in or during my stay at the hotel. Secondly was the room condition which was very dusty there's ants on the reading table which the convid virus around they fail to keep the room clean . My room was also assigned at the very corner of the hotel which across my room was the utility lift room i can hear banging of door and sound of trolleys throughout the day. very,1,-0.9012
"Dirty hotel, poor service (the service counter allowed another customer to cut my queue when I was waiting to check out), the balcony curtain, shower curtain, bed sheet and bed frame all had stains, the shower leaks. TERRIBLE. ",1,-0.8986
"Close to airport, bumboat wharf and wide range of restaurants. We liked the top floor swimming pool overlooking the bay. Handy also was the availabilty of guest washing machine and drier as we had 1 weeks washing to do before continuing our travels.",4,0.5574
"The hotel is tired, in need of decoration and a good clean. That said our room was decorated and relatively clean, although the floor could do with a good mop! The outstanding feature of the hotel are the staff in the executive lounge, Ben, Pam, Lynn and Hafiz couldn't be any better, they really looked after our needs, thank-you we really appreciate your efforts and warmth. Hotel reception was indifferent with the exception of Yusri, he is the guy to see if something needs attention, he was always happy to help, great guy. We weren't told about the executive club benefits when we checked in, hence the indifferent comment, it was another guest who sold us on the idea and benefits of the upgrade and the chance to Ben and co in the lounge.  The hotel is in Changi village and the",4,0.9838
"Good choice if you want a quiet location away from the city. The hotel provides an hourly free shuttle bus to/from the airport (T2) and to the city, which is very convenient. Lovely hotel and staff, clean and well-equipped; gorgeous infinity pool on the roof and a second pool on ground floor. Quiet vicinity close to walks, islands, beach, local shops and hawker centre for great food. ",5,0.9697
"If you require the space and is particular about cleanliness, this is the choice hotel.  Staff is very friendly and helpful.  Location-wise, there are many eateries nearby the hotel that offer local food at reasonable price.",4,0.762
"We enjoyed the stay in Village Changi Hotel. However, the checking in system needs to be improved. It is not nice to let guests queue for more than 1 hour just to be attended by 2 receptionists. Hence, not much facility and service information transpired between the checking in guests and the receptionists. Other than that the service was very good.",4,0.8053
Efficient check in and out. Friendly staff..lobby personnel were attentive to our needs asking if we needed a taxi etc.Quality of coffee and toiletries and towels need improvement. Extra blanket /pillow would be great.,3,0.9201
"Great for weekend getaway and gatherings! Enjoy the sun, sand, breeze and food within the vicinity.  There's efficient shuttle service to the airport.  Just a perfect place to unwind, chillax &amp; recharge:)",4,0.9336
Would recommend the toilet to be cleaner and cater for all races as it wasn't equipped with a Hose or WC.  More programmes could be added to the Television. Food from the kitchen is very pricey but nearby eateries are helpful.,4,0.7003
"Stayed here while transferring to Hanoi. Hotel staff were attentive, location was good and transfer went well. The shuttle bus provided was worth it.  Only disadvantage to this hotel was the shower, I had to climb in, which was difficult due to my height ( I'm just below 5ft) and at one point I slipped and banged my knee against the bath.   Would stay here again if I was transferring again.",4,0.1531
"It's a very warm welcome, staff are very friendly and efficient, room is very clean and comfy, very good location for food lovers and fishing hobbies.  A very nice location which is near to the seaside ",5,0.9742
"Excellent location,  right by the sea / beach /eateries . This is the place to go to if you want complete relaxation, and Orchard  Road is no longer a temptation.   However, the hotel badly needs some upgrading to keep up with the  2020 demand .  ",3,0.3818
My overall experience is sleeping quality no good due with the pillows too soft. The front desk staffs can improve further in handling customers request. Front hotel ambience should create like beach atmosphere as is near beach and welcome guest greeting effort is important for first impression.,2,0.9382
"Staff were friendly enough, the room had a terrible musty odour, similar to a mouldy smell, amenities very outdated and could use a revamp, it was clean, the food was very expensive and average quality. Location to the airport is good. ",2,0.6908
"Good clean room, excellent room service, good shower and bathroom. Bed was comfy, plenty of choice on tv, i asked for a smoking room and was given a room with no window to open and no ashtray! But they supplied one later. Free shuttle to airport",5,0.908
I will always staycation here as it is a family friendly hotel and so no hanky panky or sleazy stuff so it is a clean hotel. Always love the location because I love to go to the beach and eat at popular local food market named Changi Village.,5,0.9382
"This was our first stay in Singapore and we were looking for a hotel close to the airport that was in a relatively quiet area, with good transport links and also close to nature reserves.  This hotel was absolutely ideal for our needs.  Walking distance to Changi Beach, and a short boat ride to Pulau Ubin was perfect for wildlife exploration.  The hotel is close walking distance to numerous food outlets including the Hawker Centre. There were numerous local transport options to explore further  afield in Singapore.  We used the shuttle bus to the airport to then use the MRT, although we could have used the local buses to connect to the MRT. The hotel itself was clean and everyone was welcoming and friendly.   We booked a Club room which gave access to the Executive room for",5,0.9638

I recently stayed for one night costing $248.50 Singapore dollars for room only. The standard of the hotel certainly Does Not reflect the price l had tp pay. No upkeep l would say for many years. Room air-conditioning vent dirty painr work terrible. Carpet dirty at lift with crushed biscuit during our stay. No hotel information in room. Wanted to contact reception didnt know what number to press. The price atrocious for the quality of hotel. I could have got a comparable price in the city and a much nicer hotel.

"I initially made a reservation believing that this was an airport property. On arrival at Singapore's airport I was told I had just missed the bus and would have to wait one hour for the next one. After a long tiring flight I did not want to hear this, so off I was in a taxi.  20 minutes later I arrived at what was supposed to be a property close to the airport.  The check in was a nightmare. I waited nearly 20 minutes to be registered. With one person on duty, I finally got to the agent.  My over priced room was old looking, no decorations - bare walls, small and stuffy. Very little worked in the room and the bed, booked as a queen was in reality two singles.   I ate at their roof top Italian restaurant adjacent the beautiful infinity pool.

The shuttle  service could improved as we waited for an hour at the airport for pick and there was no sign of the shuttle coming.Finally we have to book a cab at our own expense to reach hotel.

"I can hear the noise produced along the corridor and the rooms next to mine. This is very irritating. The rooms are worse that a ""Bed and Breakfast"" hostel. It does not deserve to be a 3.5 star hotel. Very terrible experience.  It also toke me 20 minutes to check-in even when there are 2 counters serving. ",1,-0.8685
"We first booked this hotel in 2019 for a 1 night stopover on our way back to the U.K. we decided to book it again this year on our way out to Australia and have a longer stay. The hotel has great facilities, 2 pools and a gym. It also had 3 restaurants to suit a number of tastes. It is also a 5 minute walk from the beach so ideal for families. Okay, you are not in the City but you are close to the airport, with a free transfer service and, if you are trying to avoid Coronavirus, it is away from the crowds.  You can book directly through Far East Hospitality and if you register you get a discount.  In the hotel, if you pay by MasterCard you get a 15% discount.

Decided to book this hotel as i want to get away from the city. Hotel is surrounded with eateries and a food centre. 10 mins walk and you will find yourself at the Changi Beach. I was greeted by friendly hotel staff and checking in was quick and smooth. Room allocated (425) was facing the road with little view of Pulau Ubin. Room was neat and tidy. The only negative part of my room was the presence of tidy ants on the desk as well as in the bathroom. This is something i hope the hotel can look into. Did not opt for breakfast as food hunting was never an issue when i stay at Village Hotel Changi. Roof top swimming pool is nice with an overview of Pulau Ubin &amp; Pulau Tekong. Am lucky to have a preview of the Airshow as the planes with rehearsing for coming Singapore Airshow. Hotel,4,0.936

Good clean hotel near Changi. We stayed just the one night as taking an early flight to Australia. Nice room and very good staff. Be very careful taking a cab from the airport. If they offer you a limo say no as it will cost twice the price of a normal taxi. Limo will cost 55 Sing. Versus 30 in a taxi  Good brewery restaurant opposite in Changi village. ,4,0.9214
"It's a nice hotel in the furthest east of Singapore. It's near the airport and a whole lot of old town Singaporean shops around the area. The Hawker Centre nearby is a gem to try a variety of local hawker fare. The hotel was decent and clean. The staff were efficient but you can tell the hotel is getting older. However, generally still a good stay for the weekend. It can get really crowded with patrons. Otherwise, recommended for the price and the nice surroundings of Changi Village. ",3,0.9246

Which room number? Which level? Breakfast details? Check out time etcetc. The staff just pass me keys and expect me to find out the rest myself? Direction signs are not obvious, lift lobby at level 3 is dark. I can't find the direction to my room. Have to stand at the corridor to figure out.  Bathtub choked. Water flooded until it covered my whole feet. The shower hose is SO SHORT that i have to bend down to shower. i cant even lift it above my head to bathe. And im only 1.7m tall.  TV is not connected to anything. It's just a screen that you can switch it on to watch black screen. What's the point",1,-0.8698
"Good location, near to seaside (opportunity for night walking) as well as the airport (incl. hotel shuttle bus), more restaurants around. Nice staff. I enjoyed comfortable club room as well. Hotel swimming pool also good for relax.",4,0.9664
"We stayed in 2 Club Rooms in mid December as a family of four.  We found the Hotel to be very comfortable, nice cold airconditioning, friendly staff and a lovely little Club Room where we seemed to spend our short stay.  There was a nice selection for afternoon tea and for the canapes in the evening and for breakfast.  It was a nice quiet haven.  Our rooms were also quite good.  Good size and comfortable.  The Hotel may need a little maintenance when you first see it, but inside it was just fine.  Would recommend staying here in the Club Rooms.",5,0.963
Far surpassed my expectations. We had an 18 wait for flight home to UK so booked here to pass time. Room very comfortable with sea view on 7th floor. Tea/coffee making facilities in room and also shampoo/shower gel/toothbrushes. Shower just a little dated. Wonderful outside pool on 8th floor and one also downstairs. Amazing views from top too. We ate at Harry's next door and the food was very very good. Free shuttle to airport when we left at 10pm. Don't think they run through the night but perfect for us. Just book at reception and wait inside 10 minutes before. Transfer to Terminal 2 only but easy to get to other terminals once at airport by Skytrain which are frequent and quick. Highly recommend this hotel. ,5,0.9737
We had a comfortable stay at the hotel. Room is clean. Toilet is abit on the tired side.  The club lounge is situated at the 6th floor. It has a beautiful view. Lovely outdoor seats available too. Mr Ben n team hosted us with good food(not extensive but sufficient) and always ready to lend a hand. ,5,0.9371
"Thanks Christine for allocating a room side by side and with a balcony in one of the rooms with the help of Usher (Quincy) too! Thanks for the great stay and hospitality! My family enjoyed it very much.. Thanks Abdullah, Sari and all the front office and housekeeping team! Teamwork makes the dream work! Mask up and gloves on! Let's fight this time together! ",5,0.9605
"I would like to commend Mr Arvin , for his excellent service and professionalism when handling the guest check in.   We checked in on 1st of Feb around 1530hrs and there was a long Q of guest waiting at both counters . During the process of waiting, i observed Mr Arvin' service behaviour. He consistently displayed high professional service behaviour even tho at times he was abruptly interrupted by some impatient guest. He attended to each and every guest attentively.  This is my 2nd time staying in Changi V hotel for our family weekend staycation over birthday &amp; anniversary celebration. And on both occasion, i must say that it has been an awesome stay.   The first touch point , which how the staff handled the guest contributes to the 70% of the service experience satisfaction on",5,0.9136
The best thing about this property is its location. Easy to reach from airport. Away from crowded area yet in a sweet and serene place. Food is good. Staff is friendly too. Rooms are clean and amenities are good enough for the price you pay. ,4,0.9735
"This is about my 12th stay at Changi Village over the past 9 or 10 years and I always feel that the place gets better every visit. The place is very clean, the housekeeping staff seem to be always cheerful despite their workload and they cannot do enough for you. This also applies to the other teams who help to make this a top notch hotel. I must make a special mention on my last visits in January to Benjamin who managed the Club Lounge, Ben, excellent service and commitment to your duties and this was noted not only how you dealt with me, but every guest passing through the lounge. If my health and wealth continue to be good...I'll be back next January!",4,0.9445
"This was a good place to break our journey from NZ to UK. The hotel could do with refurbishment, but we were comfortable, and enjoyed the view over trees to the bay, and it's also convenient for a walk along the shore. There's a lovely pool on the roof terrace. We particularly appreciated the Club Lounge: thanks to Ben and his team for their friendly welcome and efficient service.",4,0.9904
"Thoroughly satisfied. The service and quality of the room were excellent. Special mention to Ben, the service executive who attended to me at the club lounge; I have stayed at Changi Village Hotel for four times and all four occasions left me feeling satisfied and happy thanks to Ben. He has provided me with excellent service and he exuberated a sense of passion and warmth to all the guests that he came across.",5,0.9824
"Good respite from flights Clean and  efficient hotel  good staff clean air, some breezes from the bay. worth the trip away from Changi airport- but it is quite a long trip . They have shuttle buses but taxis are also cheap and you don't have to wait for the hourly bus.",4,0.7876
"Nice and friendly personnel,clean and spacious room. The location is quite good with lots of food options neardy,like 2 minutes walk. Transportation to and from the airport is an advantage. Overall, recommended.",4,0.8999
"We arrived In the evening and were told we just missed the shuttle. It would be 1 1/2 hours later before the next shuttle would come. We took a taxi because we were tired from our flight. The hotel is not close to the airport, and in an industrial area. After waiting through a very long line of people checking in, we  finally got to the room, where we were assailed by the mildew smell. The room was exceptionally cheaply furnished, with something sticky on the desk. There was mold in the shower. We called the front desk and told them we would not be staying, as we had reservations for 2 nights. We would have left that night had it not been so late. I checked the rate quoted on their site -$73.00- and the rate we were charged $200; and complained to the front desk. They said",2,-0.8225
We wanted to break the long flight back to Australia. Close to the water and the park for a relaxing walk. Few restaurants to choose from not many vegetarian options. Hotel little older however nice and comfortable for the break. ,4,0.8417
"Shocking - Was falsely sold a $440 room from Agoda that was worth $90 - Laid a complaint with both the hotel and Agoda and now a week later, we are out of pocket and the compliant is still UN-resolved - Left waiting in reception for 45 mins to check in, on the phone for 2 hours laying complaint after traveling 15 hours from New Zealand  - Over all a big let down and I recommend that you stay well clear of this hotel as there is something very dodgy going on - They blamed Agoda - Agoda blamed them - No one stood up and sorted it out - Shocking ",1,-0.8832
Very good hotel for stop over between flights. Maybe bus service should include 2 terminals ex T2and T3 but is very positive that you offer airport transfer. The breakfast compared to room rate it seems expensive. Any time I will come back,5,0.7805
"We received at the second day the towel only 1 pc, while it should be 2 pcs. the clean service did not clean the bath tub, it is still a lot of water in the bath tub.Also the small towel it is only 1 pc instead of 2 pcs",5,0.6597
"Had a staycation to celebrate two birthdays in the family recently and was delighted to get a free upgrade from deluxe room to club room with lounge access. It was a pleasant and comfortable stay, and we were very happy to have Ben and Lynn attending to us in the club lounge on both days. They were helpful and friendly, attentive to details, personal and excellent in their service, and go the extra mile, with Ben swiftly attending to late-night requests for things like cake and water when we couldn't reach anyone on the operator and manager phone lines.   The only shortcomings were not getting a sea view room this time round (happy problem, as the hotel was fully booked) and having encountered some hostile Cantonese-speaking guests hogging deck chairs at the poolside when they",5,0.9833
"Excellent free shuttle service to airport, and a neat infinity pool at the top - no one else was there when I visited though, despite great weather - so felt a bit remote. Wonderful views! The huge amount of rooms in the hotel makes it tougher for them to maintain them I think, for instance nothing in the minibar when I arrived. At 11 PM after a long flight you don have the energy to and ask about it :) A few restaurants, breakfast seemed overpriced to me (26 and 28 Singapore dollars when this was written). Wondows not completely clean, but rooms otherwise has a lot of space - good when you want to keep it tidy, put away bags, clothes etc!",3,0.9217
Walking distance to food centre and beach. Ferry terminal to Ubin Island is nearby. For those who love to chill. Quite a few  places to chill and relax within walking distance. Near the beach there is a cycling kiosk. Those who like to explore may rent a bike and cycle to the back of the airport where you can see airplane taking off and landing.,4,0.8625
"It's a convenient spot with the shuttle service and several eateries nearby. The beach is a 5-minutes walk away and you can rent a bicycle near the entrance of the beach to ride along. A recreation club just opposite the hotel provides more options of fun activities during stay. Room is spacious and clean, shower is great and bathtub is wide. Toiletries provided were of good quality. There's also an ironing board and iron in room. The operator who picked up my call for bathrobes was friendly and efficient.  The lifts were in need of an upgrade though. It was a little inconvenient when the lift was flashing 'Overload' when it was not even 50% filled and definitely way below the maximum weight limit. The line for the concierge counter could be better placed to avoid confusion. ",4,0.9604
"shuttle, comfortable bed, excellent shower ,perfect for a stop over in Singapore would definitely recommend and visit again would have preferred the shuttle ran later as we missed the last one because of a delayed flight",5,0.891
"When you book a club room here, you can enjoy happy hour(s) from 6-8 in the executive lounge Floor 6. You will be even happier if advised on your yummies by Hafiz, who assembled my amazing coconut and shrimp based soup, taking care to add the right balance of chilli, tofu, fish paste and veg. The other staff, Pamela, Nara, Lynn and Ben, quietly glide around, restocking the tasty snacks and clearing up. Outside you enjoy the warm breeze, watching for the soaring eagles and listening to the chirruping of the mynahs. One or two may hop down to see if you leave a crumb! Meanwhile, drinks are complimentary, the service great and the ambience superb. Thank you, Hafiz and team. Maggi and Norris Millar. ",5,0.9883
"Could hear planes flying over all night. Refrigerator didn't work, cupboard doors wouldn't shut properly meaning cupboard light glowed all night and grab rail into shower (shower over bath) was very loose, however on advising hotel staff of problems, they had an engineer to our room within 5 minutes. Plenty of good and cheap street food very close by",3,-0.3384
"We stayed 1 night after a cruise prior to heading back to Australia.  Great to have the free shuttle to T2.  The room was spacious and the bed very comfortable; overall cleanliness of the room was good.  The hotel is looking tired as has been said but for the money paid for a room with club lounge access it was wonderful value for money.  The quality of the items in the club lounge at breakfast and happy hour was very good.  Can't comment about during the day as we were out and about.  Staff were friendly and accommodating, allowing us an early check-in which was very much appreciated.  Would definitely consider staying again for a bit of a relax prior to heading home.",5,0.9916
"Had an enjoyable stay at the Village Hotel Changi.  The room was quiet, the bed comfortable and all spotless.  Good choice of food in the Club Lounge and the pool was superb.  Good location as it was only 15 minutes from airport and an enjoyable board walk close by.  Would recommend.",5,0.9661
"This year again I have stayed two weeks in this lovely and welcoming place. There are in fact not that many changes compared to last year, mostly it is concerning the staff who is moved around to other positions in hotel and a, as always a few new faces. In many of my reviews I am focusing mostly on the staff as (at least in my case) they can always 'make it... or brake it' ...  and this regardless of hotel physical amenities and other.ess Taking about the staff, I really have to mention one name: Benjamin (Ben) Tan, ex Singapore Airlines flight attendant  and currently the Manager of Executive Club. It's someone that you can start absolutely any topic at any time. He knew all the last names of all clients around. Amazing. ...and all that with that famous and fantastic ease of",5,0.9538

"Great hotel, friendly staff, especially Ben, Lynn, Hafiz and Pam in the Club lounge. Excellent attention to detail, remembered my name every time I visited.A lovely location with plenty to see and do in and around Changi area. Would definately recommend. The hotel itself could probably benefit from a lick of paint, or even a good clean on the outside,but inside my room was very clean, and the beds extremely comfortable.",5,0.9851

Hotel needs to paint and look better. Facilities seem a bit run down. The staff are friendly. The prices for the hotel not worth the stay. Very close to a lot of eatery. And free shuttle to airport. Not helpful driver to take the bus down from the shuttle. ,3,0.7508

The hotel location was really nice with a lot of food places surrounding the hotel. The problem is that there's no mrt so traveling from hotel can be expensive. Theres lack of clear communication when I asked questions about the airport shuttle before I booked and on the day of my flight I did not received a wake up call when I asked for it the day before ,3,-0.1298
"We chose this hotel due to the four circle review,  we just needed a a place to stay the night and it was close to the airport.  Check in was scheduled late and was handled poorly.  Even though we would fill the shuttle in the AM (runs every hour) we could not be guaranteed a space and there was no compromise to run another.  We would take a taxi instead.  No amenities available for a bite to eat when we arrived as they were all closed.  Room is poorly finished and worn.  There was mould on the ceiling by the vent and in the caulking.  I have seen better mom and pop motels in Western Canada and the US for half of what we paid.  Price does not reflect what you get.",2,-0.4019
"I absolutely loved this hotel. Nicely tucked away from the hustle of the main streets, this hotel is clean and the staff are accommodating. The hotel gives you a 'passport's guide with where to visit around the area and I loved all the places recommended. Situated in a place where there are many options for food- I would highly recommend the hawkers center about 300-500m from the hotel. The food here is incredible for the low costs you pay and the people are so kind. The amenities in the hotel such as the gym and pool are kept clean and all equipment is up to a high standard. The restaurant located in the hotel is also amazing. Such great quality good and staff cater to your every need. The rooms are well kept and the beds are very comfortable which is exactly what I needed",5,0.9903
This was our third stay at this hotel.  We had an overnight layover in Singapore and this is an ideal choice for a short stay.  Chose a club room this time.  Room was fine.  Evening drinks and canapés were very good.  Club lounge breakfast was disappointing.  No egg dishes and attendant was missing in action!  Otherwise our short stay was ok.,3,0.5081
"Booked this staycation through the ""Birthday Treat"" EDM sent by Far East Hospitality to its subscribed members to its mailing list.   Check-in took approximately an hour as the room was not available, despite us only checking in at 3.15pm, which was way past the official timing of 2pm. However, this is negligible considering this is a Saturday where there may be a high turnover of guests. Room given was again far from the Club Lounge, (and again on level 5). I have booked the Club Room multiple times and is always given rooms on the level 5 and the same reason given was ""We are having full-occupancy"".   We stayed in Room 540, and there were several issues that we wished to highlight and to be taken seriously. 1. The torchlight and its casing attached to the wardrobe has came",4,0.5267
