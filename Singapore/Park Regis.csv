"We initially only planned to stay 4 nights at the Park Regis hotel. However, due to changes to our travel plans we ended up staying for 10 nights and I am glad we chose this hotel. It was a great location in Singapore and good value for money being only a stones throw away from the busy tourist spot Clarke quay for Bars and Restaurants. As it was our first time in Singapore we were offered complimentary breakfast for each day of our stay which came in handy as food can be expensive in Singapore and the breakfast buffet selection was really good, they changed the menu every few days which was a positive as well.   The bed in the rooms is very comfy and the rooms are cleaned daily. I turned 30 when I was staying in this hotel and I didn’t mention to the staff as I didn’t want to",5,0.9726
"We stayed for 3 days and 2 nights. Highly recommended for family with kids  to get the room at the second floor with direct pool access. My son enjoyed our stay so much because of it.  Location very convenient. A short 3 mins walks to  Clarke quay MRT. Walking distance to Clarke quay and Chinatown, and a short ride to Sentosa and Orchard road. Staff are very friendly and always ready to help. Special thanks  to the front office and concierge team for being so accommodating and friendly the whole time. Breakfast spread was good too.  Thank you , we will definitely comeback ",5,0.9822
"It is hard to know where to start. The Park Regis has a wonderful location close to Clarke Quay, the CBD and China Town. It was the perfect base for our holidays. The room was magical yes some people could say small but the space is so cleverly used, the bed the most comfortable ever, by the first morning I would normally have a sore back, but after eight nights, no issue. The pool is fantastic and amazing ambiance for an inter city location.   Finally the staff, every single one of them and it does matter where they worked within the hotel, were just the best. We feel like we were being cared for by friends. Full of information and assistance, we will be back time and time again. ",5,0.9918
"Excellent location. Convenient for MRT, near to river and riverfront restaurants/bars.  Good facilities - pool, gym and restaurant. Friendly and helpful staff We had a pool side room with balcony which was great",5,0.9493
"We only stayed one night at the Park Regis Singapore but were thrilled with its proximity to great food and the Clarke Quay district, with its lively nightlife, riverside bars &amp; restaurants.    The hotel is very clean, with excellent customer service and a breakfast buffet sure to please- omelette station and all.  We hope to stay here longer during our next stay in Singapore!",5,0.988
"We had booked for four nights but our flight was brought forward one day so I had to book a extra night and it booked a city view room for the extra night unlike the other nights but your staff let us stay in the city view for all five nights and gave us complimentary breakfast for all five nights and the breakfast was wonderful, but all the staff were so helpful and friendly and the room and view were wonderful. Thank you so much ",5,0.9831
"I was looking forward to visiting Singapore and staying at the park regis but unfortunately  due to the coronavirus I cancelled my trip. I was disappointed in speaking to park regis staff about my change in travel plans. not only was staff very rude when expressing my concerns  but I was denied a refund citing a non-cancellation policy. Despite the current worldwide health crisis and provisions to keep people safe, the park regis decided to enforce a non-refund policy only offering the inconvenience of rescheduling my stay to a different date. Not expecting the Park regis to follow alone with many other hotels, airlines and business to softening there policy I was reminded that common sense and good customer service are both priceless and hard to find.....",1,-0.973
"During our stay, my Dad was unfortunately in hospital for 3 days. The staff could not have done more for us. Their customer care is outstanding. I cannot rate the hotel highly enough. The location is excellent, short walk to the tube station and to the restaurants in Clarke Quay.",5,0.8591
"My 10 yesr old Son &amp; myself recently stayed at this Hotel for two nights. I have to say that the Staff are incredible, so friendly &amp; attentive. They made my Son some paper animals &amp; gave him free biscuits &amp; Sweets which I thought was a lovely thoughtfull things to do for him. Our room was lovely &amp; exceptionally clean.  I have stayed in lots of Hotels over the years but I have to say this Hotel &amp; the staff are exceptional &amp; I HIGHLY recommend the Hotel. I have to Thank the Duty Manager called Rank Tan who was so helpfull aswell.  Thank you everyone at this Hotel &amp; we will be back one day without exception &amp; if you are going to Singapore make sure you stay at this Hotel.",5,0.9772
"Excellent staff. Clean rooms. Only stayed for a night but if had the time to stay longer, I would. One of the staff members graciously reserved free breakfast because it was my first time in Park Regis.  ",5,0.9201
"The room, location, and facilities were good and standard for a 4-star hotel.  I was very happy though, with the staff members, who were extremely friendly, helpful, and understanding. Kudos to Charley, the receptionist, and the 5th floor housekeeping uncle that I didn't have the chance to get to know. Other staff members that I met were also great.  Would definitely stay here again!",5,0.9723
"Very clean hotel with helpful and considered staff. The location is perfect for a first time sightseeing trip in Singapore. Perfectly situated near 2 main MRT lines. Also in walking distance of a lot of the main attractions, bars and restaurants.",5,0.9476
"Elegant and confortable room. Very clean like everything in Singapour. Hotel very well situated, walking distance to metro stations and Chinatown. Very nice staff. and nice swimming pool. the only thing maybe is the mosque call at 6 AM... but the hotel can't do anything about that. ",5,0.8283
Had a great 1 night stay.  Staff were friendly and efficient especially Chandran and Dana who welcomed and assisted us during check in.  Hotel is well located.  Very near Clarke Quay. We also had a good room with direct pool access.  Thank you for making our stay enjoyable!,5,0.969
Excellent place to stay when in Singapore. Outstanding service. Great Location. Wonderful amenities. Happy feeling throughout the stay thanks to everybody at Park Regis. *I felt the door boys were too young.  Thank you Park Regis.,5,0.9779
"For me was Park Regis Hotel a very good choice. I celebrated my birthday in Hotel too. Thank you to the Hotel for best wishes and a piece of cake. Very nice. The Hotel Location is very good, service excellent, room very clean. I enjoy it. ",4,0.9851
Was in Singapore for the Airshow and hotel choice was Park Regis. Friendly and effective staff during check-in. Very well cleaned everywhere I was around at the hotel. The room wasn't that big but for just two nights and being just one it's fine. If you share room be sure it's someone you know very well due to the funny bathroom setup. Btw. would you share room with an unknown?,3,0.9663
Good room. Only thing to fault is that the bathroom is not really separated from the bed area. You can see and hear everything that goes on in there. Would be uncomfortable with someone you don't know well!,3,-0.5432
"I stayed at Park Regis 4 years ago and, after extensive research, could not find a property which would surpass it for my recent 10-day ""Food Adventure"" stay. Easy walk to Hong Lim and Chinatown Complex hawker centres (dozens upon dozens of fascinating stalls offering myriad gustatory Asian delights). The property is, in a word, ""spiffy."" Thoroughly turned out with top-end amenities and with a staff of English speaking young men and women who would do anything to please you - and they did. Was there a glitch? Yes! The bar had no bourbon - Gad!  Highly recommended.",5,0.9213
Had a wonderful stay at Park Regis. Beds were very comfortable and shower had grest water pressure. Excellently located very closely to China Town and Clarke Quay with  great variety of restaurants near by as well as public transport. Staff were extremely pleasant and helpful.,5,0.9721
"I stayed for 3 nights. It’s location is excellent as many attractions are near by.clark quay, boat quay,China town and marina bay are near to this hotel. Room was clean and bed was comfortable.The best thing i liked was the sitting area in the room to enjoy outside view. Service was excellent and staffs were very supportive. The only thing I didn’t like was bathroom layout.There was no privacy.",4,0.9774
"Stayed for 1 night after cruise, wish it was longer, check in was efficient and safe(temperature check was required for health and safety )  Staff was professional and very helpful, Location was excellent, close to Chinatown. Pool, gym and room were clean and had sleek, modern design.",5,0.9501
"Recently stayed here for 10 nights. Room okay apart from the noise off the aircon &amp; fridge. Even when the aircon was of off it still made noise so bring ear plugs.  Location wise its a 5 minute walk across the bridge to Clarke Quay. Its a 10 minute walk to Chinatown &amp; Peoples Park food court   Big special mention to Akif &amp; Ayla who work there, great enthusiasm, local knowledge and generally nice people who make your stay that extra special.   Pool is also nice although the sun creeps over the top after midday so you are left with cloud.  Will return again",4,0.9712
We spend 4 nice days in a large family room. The room was large and overlooking the pool. The nespresso machine in the room was appreciated. Breakfast was okay and with a good selection. Location is very good with a lot to see within walking distance ,4,0.9153
Great location as across road from Clarke Quay and only a short walk to Chinatown. Enjoyed an early morning stroll along the river after a hotel breakfast. MRT Station close by so have access to all districts of Singapore.,4,0.8126
Park Regis Singapore is staffed by friendly professional people.  In a great location.  Rooms are spotless and well looked after.  Highly recommend for a short or long stay.  Lovely pool great to relax in after a day out and about.,5,0.9719
"Stayed here for a holiday with my wife and our 1 year old toddler. The property is located at a nice location just a 5 mnt drive from Clarke.  The room size was decent, the linen was spotless, the room was bright and sleep quality was good.  I had a couple of issues, which I am sure if they work on are pretty doable and not at all heavy on their pockets  1. Infant food- They denied making anything for my baby, not even a simple mashed potatoes. Even after explaining them the situation  2. They instead offered us bananas, after we pais for it. A couple of bananas for the  infant and I had to pay for them too.    I have stayed in a lot of 5 star hotels in few countries and they are generally happy to provide infant food  and milk for free. How much a 1 year old can really eat.",4,0.9612
"As you would expect from a Singapore hotel. Everything about this hotel was first class. The underground is a very short walk away to get exploring. Breakfast was a good choice, didn’t get to use the pool but sure that would have been great ",5,0.8898
"Great location to Clarke Quay, public transport, and an easy walk to many attractions.  The room was small but a comfort bed, small bathroom and the toilet was a bit short. However the hotel had great facilities, lovely pool and a well equipped gym.  The staff were excellent, pointing out where to have dinner and the best advantage place for watching the New Years fireworks.  We had a nice breakfast., the hotel was clean and tidy.",4,0.9926
"Staff friendly and helpful, clean rooms well appointed.  Close to everything.  Beautiful pool and the dining area clean with beautiful food.  Concierge are happy to recommend great local things to do and see.  You wont be disappointed staying here",5,0.9863
"Great location across the road from Clarke Quay, however the room was quite small with no full wall separating toilet and shower (only frosted glass doors) which was somewhat uncomfortable.  Breakfast was average - hard fried eggs, hard not pleasant tasting waffles, had to run bread through toaster at least 4 times to brown sufficiently, milk tasted strange so could not drink coffee or tea. Did not like the long tables in the hotel restaurant, there were only 4 tables for 4 people and the rest were huge long tables for anyone to sit with you.  We were signed up the the stay well rewards programme but received an email after our stay ended that we were not eligible to receive rewards points, so did not see the point in signing up to this.  We certainly thought this hotel would be",3,0.8156
Very well placed hotel for a short stopover in Singapore- very clean and well equipped. Rooms are on small side. Staff very helpful and efficient. Very good shower and good quality towels.  Would recommend.,4,0.9675
"The hotel is extremely well located for all the cultural experiences in the heart of Singapore.  The room, whilst not particularly spacious was vert well laid out and very comfortable.  The breakfast were good.  Staff were excellent, both very welcoming and extremely helpful.",5,0.9651
"Convenient location close to Clarke Quay metro station. Very comfortable bed and friendly service. Separate toilet and shower cabin in room. Sufficient choice at breakfast (toast bread, omelet, fresh fruit &amp; yoghert, English breakfast, local hot dishes).",5,0.8439
"Location is near MRT clarke quay, use exit merchant court n then pass cross road? Hotel is new, soundprofed, rain shower, reception at 3rd floor, clean hotel, good swimming pool, gym and fast check in, value 8/10",5,0.7906
We stayed here for 2 days before embarking on a cruise.  The hotel is located close to Chniatown and across the street from a metro station.  The lobby is on the 3rd floor and there are staff at the door to direct you to the lobby floor.  The room was clean and bed was comfortable.  I would stay there again.,5,0.7351
"The ideal place to stay in a picturesque place as Singapore. Smiling and really helpful staff (special thanks to Alya for everything!!), cosy and always clean room!! Gym and swimming pool excellent !! The restaurant offers you tastefull dishes -Chinese or Residense kitchen-!! Park Regis thanks for all!! Looking forward to come back!!",5,0.9763
"A smart, friendly, efficient hotel. Small rooms but very well equipped, nice pool and great location.   The main lobby could do with a lounge area and bar. The dining area was quite impersonal, though to be fair we never used it for dining and chose to go out instead as Singapore has such a fantastic selection of eateries.",4,0.9729
"From the outside terrace you can see into rooms at that level and levels above.  The natural light is enough to see guests in their rooms. I opened the curtain in the morning to see the gardener looking at me. So I went outside to check - you can easily see in! Also, the inner blind does not reach to the bottom of the window. Otherwise the room and hotel were fine. ",2,0.497
"The hotel staff were very friendly and the check in was easy. Our room was not ready as we arrived before check in time, but they happily took our bags and once the room was ready they put the bags in the room.  The room was pretty basic and the layout was very strange because of the bathroom. The bathroom is part of the room with a frosted glass door in front of the shower and toilet. The shower wasn’t great and the drain was very noise. Cleanliness seemed ok.  We had an issue with the light in the wardrobe which remained on even though the door was closed, however the next day this was sorted and we hadn’t even spoken to the staff about it.  2 bottle in the room and the pool was nice, but cold! ",4,0.9682
This is a fantastic hotel in a great location. The staff couldn’t do enough for us to make us feel welcome. With Clarke Quay just across the road we were right in the centre of everything from the moment we stepped out through the doors.,5,0.8934
"Arrived late from long flight,checked in quickly.short walk from Clarke quay mtr,and the bars and restaurants.comfy bar,good aircon,separate Wc/shower,with opaque glass.no problem for us.minibar,which we did not use,and complimentary water.did not have breakfast or dinner. Very pleasant stay.",4,-0.1313
"Good staff, particularly in housekeeping, very helpful and cheerful. Handy location for Clarke Quay. A bit soulless but good value for what you get. It is harder and harder to find hotels with character in Singapore so this is a reasonable compromise.",4,0.9067
"Stayed 2 nights and loved the location close to Quays, Chinatown and MRT. Decent breakfast and great pool, although a bit cold. Nice feature is that you may use the pool and showers even after checking out! All staff very friendly and service-minded.",4,0.9391
Easily accessible hotel in a great location close to Clarke Quay and Chinatown. Rooms clean and tidy and had all that I needed. Breakfast and dinner available at good times plus the length of time. Thanks.,4,0.9325
"Fantastic hotel, close to everything with informative and happy staff. Samuel at Concierge was awesome at helping with local attractions. The room was clean and well presented and the room service meals were lovely. Loved the pool and waterfall - so nice after a day walking around Singapore. ",4,0.9855
"First, the good part - the staff was extremely courteous and helpful.  The staff gets 5 stars.  Then the bad part.  The room was well worn.   The sink was cracked and didn't drain.   The water pressure (and temperature) varied in the shower enough to be borderline dangerous.  The toilet is a glassed in stall with plenty of air space above the door, so nothing you do in there is at all private.   There are limited power outlets.  At least on the 5th floor you can hear every conversation by the pool clearly.  The worst part.   We happened to be staying there the night they were doing electrical maintenance so the power was off, but the emergency lighting in the room works.  Good news: the emergency light works.   Bad news: it shines right at the bed.    The hotel was courteous",2,-0.6164
"Quiet Hotel in a Central location between Clarke Quay and Chinatown, MRT few meters from the Hotel allows a great mobility. Good service and attentioned staff. Nice asian food for the breakfast! Pool allow a nice rest if needed after sightseeing.",5,0.9299
All of staff members were very kind and they kept my luggage after check out of the hotel until night. The breakfast was very delicious. The location is near Clarke Quay and it's not far from Marina bay so good good !!,5,0.9498
"The hotel was not known to us before and was recommended by our travel agent. The hotel was recommended because of central location to many interesting points. When it comes up to the room, what we found did exceed our expectations by far: We found a nice and quiet room to feel well-being. Especially we did enjoy the breakfast and the pool in the afternoon. Super friendly staff, helpful with all questions!!!",5,0.9696
"We enjoyed our stay at Park Regis. The location is perfect, the Mrt is just across the road and so are the restaurants by the river. China town is just a short walk away from the hotel. The pool area is nice. Staff are really sweet, always greet you with a smile, and when we had some problems with printing some important papers they did everything they could to help us, much appreciated. The only negative is that there is no separate bathroom in the room, and the toilet is just inside glass walls with a door that doesn’t even go all the way up to the ceiling. ",4,0.9465
"NO REVIEW. All was ok, including staff, service, cleaning, etc... Location is also good, very close to Marina Bay and very close to the restaurant and the evening life of Singapore so, it is an hotel which is very good for everybody.",4,0.6208
Had a great stay of 4 days.  Hotel Very helpful in arranging tours and was great to be able to use the pool on check out day. (We had a late flight). Good location. Handy to Chinatown and lots of restaurants. Will be back. ,5,0.9348
"Great location for ease of access  to sites around Singapore but rooms , although clean and well appointed,  are overly crowded for a couple to move around in comfort.  Some staff were very helpful and friendly but restaurant staff were particularly unhelpful and the cost  of eating and drinking at the hotel encouraged us to go elsewhere for all our meals. I asked if i could  have a small amount of milk for one cup of tea in my room (dislike the creamer supplied)  and  was told  I would have to purchase a cup for $4. I thought this ""Company policy"" was very poor, considering what we paid for the room. ",3,0.965
"Good location , very good service , except restaurant very good amenities in room, sadly no separate bathrooms. Good value for rate. Otherwise very nice hotel, nice pool and gym.  Restaurant food was bland  and overpriced, combo dish of french fries was OK , no dipping sauce  was provided , request for hot sauce brought Ketchup. ",3,0.9477
We stayed here over the New Years Period and had a fantastic time. The staff were extremely polite and helpful. They really knew what to see and where to go in Singapore. The facilities were very good. We had a small studio room which had direct access to the pool.,5,0.8707
Comfortable stay in excellent location . Access to subway and Clarke Quay great . Nice touches provision of towels at swimming pool. Air conditioning also great as Singapore can be very humid . Great stay 3rd time at the hotel . Staff helpful and polite .,5,0.978
Nice place to stay. Equidistant to every important places in SG. Nice please to stay. Only feedback will be Staff at Bell Desk/restaurant need to be little more polite and non discriminate. Cleanliness was very good and would love to come again. ,4,0.9441
"Traveler or Family short staycation who is looking for a stay in Singapore Hotel, i would recommend Park Regis. Their location is good, near to MRT and shopping area. Their service is good. Staffs are very friendly.   ",4,0.8955
"Recently stayed at the Park Regis. The hotel was in a good location the room was neat and modern. I did find it a little small around the bathroom area and difficult with the space and accessing the wardrobe was a bit tight. When calling housekeeping they were fast to respond.  Would i stay here again no, i would rather check out another venue.",4,0.296
"When we arrived the concierge staff were really lovely. We arrived early and was told the room wasn’t ready but we could leave our bags and come back. We came back at 2pm as we had to get ready for NYE night at Marina Bay and they said the room would be ready between 2-3pm. When asked the room still wasn’t ready. Just after 3pm we was allowed to check in.   The staff again were really nice.   Our room was nice and simple.   The layout of the bathroom wasn’t the best and we had little tiny bugs around the sink and taps.   The bed was really comfy however when I woke up in the morning I couldn’t stop itching and had little bite marks all over me, this happened a lot more on the last night and when checking out I told a member of staff and they apologised. And offered some cream",4,0.9791
"Great location and a lovely hotel if a little over priced. Lovely swimming pool and gym. Was charged for beer I didnt have so beware!! I would have returned here in the future but not now. When I say I had  nothing from mini bar, it means I had nothing from the mini bar!!!",3,0.7897
"I arrived at the Park Regis to a delightfully appointed room. My first impressions were good. My impressions over the next 4 days only got better. The house maids were excellent, the concierge crew were a wealth of local knowledge and the buffet breakfast is one of, if not, the best I have come across. It's central to the MRT and very conveniently located. But I should warn you about the beds. Once you lay down you will just want to sleep. Extremely comfortable.",5,0.9603
"There are hotels that make one's stay in a distant land comfortable. But Park Regis can make your stay convenient and comfortable. Just like your home, only that it is away from your home. Conveniently located in Singapore, one will never ask for more.",5,0.8442
"Very Good Location Near  Chinatown, Clarke Quays and short  way To get To Garden by the Bays. We will recommend this Hotel. Good Price, clean rooms, friendly staff and delicious meals. See you next time....",5,0.9551
Good location. Service was good and staff very helpful. Strange setup with lobby and dining in the entrance and you have to go up to level 3 to check in. Rooms are small and awkward for 2 people. A strange design.,3,0.672
Good located hotel and suitable rooms. Very good for us for an overnight staying. The check in was very quick and the room was earlier available!! The concierge was helpful with an umbrella to avoid the rain of Singapore.,4,0.8062
"The hotel is located in a great area of Singapore, beside Clarke Quay which is where most of night life happens in Singapore and only a few minutes walk to the metro. Room was very clean. Bathroom was very small, so couples might have to behave during shower :)",4,0.8777
A good place to stay some days in Singapore. China Town and clarke quay just around the corner.  Subway nearby.  Service in the Hotel was great. The Pool was the best Place to relax after visiting the town. ,4,0.9337
"Overall good.but for family with young children will not be ideal, but for couples is still more suitable and those who like clubbing or chill out will be nice. Room are tidy and clean, the passage way to room is cooling.",3,0.8629
"Made to feel very welcome, very attentive staff . Daughter even got a birthday card and cupcake as a surprise. Was offered complimentary room to get changed as our flight to SYDNEY wasn’t till the evening ",5,0.807
"I do not find my slippers changed everyday. The room is a bit small for business purpose. Toilet and shower room, in general, are acceptable. The lighting in the room is insufficient for business purpose. If it could be adjusted to a bit brighter, it is definitely much better. Noise easily come from the corridor. I hope it could be improved in future.",5,0.9509
I am travelling regularly to Singapore. Park Regis has been convenience in term of distance from my office area. This is my second stay but I do not feel the service quality as per my expectation. I can have a better experience with other nearby hotel.,3,0.5927
We stayed at the Park Regis for 2 nights. The hotel was very well located for visiting the city and the price extremely reasonable given the location. We worried about the typical musty smell of the cheaper hotel rooms in Singapore but this hotel was absolutely fine. Swimming pool was very good as well. We would definitely recommend the hotel for those who are either on business trips (v close to the business district) or holidays.,4,0.9653
"All sevices and staffs are nice and kind! The location is so great because it is took 3mins to go subway staiton by walk and easy to find bus stop surrounding hotel. So, if you're considering convenient traffic condition, this hotel is perfect to you :)",4,0.9644
The hotel has a really great location with many things to explore nearby.  And the service by all staff is great. A special mention to the front desk people as they were really helpful for us. The rooms are also cosy and comfortable.,5,0.9576
The location is excellent. The breakfast is good even I would like to include more variety of western food. The gym available 24 hours is an excellent option and location is very convenience when you are in business trip.,4,0.9153
"It was an enjoyable stay. Thanks for making my stay comfortable. The service quality was excellent however I wish the rooms (including bathrooms) were more spacious. Also, include more vegetarian options for in-room and restaurant dining.",4,0.9382
"The room and staff were all very helpful land informative. My only complaint was that my wife and had to have COLD SHOWERS in the Gymnasium area, prior to us collecting out luggage and heading to the airport.  If that facility is available to guests checking out then HOT SHOWERS should be provided.",4,0.2247
"We had a great 3 night stay here, yes we had read the reviews about the rooms being small but location wins every time for us, I don’t think we could have wished for a better located hotel. It was only a short walk to the MRT stations ( Clarke Quay or Chinatown). Literally on the door step you have Clarke Quay offering a great selection of bars and restaurants. China town is approx a 15 min walk and was our favourite area of Singapore, particularly for food. Back to the rooms, we booked a standard room ( 2 adults /2 toddlers ). We read the reviews before travelling so we knew it was not possible to fit 2 rollaway beds / cots in the room. To keep costs down and get around this issue we packed 2 of those ready made inflatable toddler beds in our suitcases and this solved the",4,0.9738
"this hotel got really nice and cozy room, good coffee by segafredo, nice minimalist room and i got room that facing the pool and street, so give me nice view in the morning and night, the food i must say, average, the accommodation good, a walk away to clarke quay and the MRT station also near, the price average , nice hotel",5,0.9529
"A more than decent hotel, where the staff attends to your needs! Walking distance from several interesting Singapore spots (e.g. Clarke Quay). The pool has a good temperature, but the chlorine percentage is a bit high.  ",4,0.4753
"What I liked: Location is nice Property is clean A couple of staff is good  Disliked · Rooms too small, but clean. Staff is efficient but not friendly. Bathrooms are really tiny. Suited for a short stay. Breakfast is terrible",4,0.528
"I went there for a business trip. Since I had not much time to prepare and my selected hotel was full so I let my secretary find a new one for me.   She gave me this, ok, 4 star good review. Ok take it.  When I got there I was shocked. The room is so small and the bathroom and the toilet was open area. I was there with my junior colleague and we had to share also open bathroom.   Absolutely everything you do in the toilet can be heard. And you can almost see through when you have a shower.  Goodbye and no more",2,0.6486
"In reading reviews online this place looked great. Amazing location, clean rooms. When we got to our room it was nice, small but nice until we realized that the shower was literally on top of the toilet separated only by a curtain so every time you showered the floor was soaking wet. Also room smelled of mildew. The location is great though! If weren’t for the bathroom maybe would have given higher rating. ",3,0.9615
"Staff is kind and helpful. Rooms are clean. 25m Pool is very nice and not crowded. There are shady areas around the pool if you don't like to get too much sun. Breakfast buffet is quite good. Eggs the way you like, waffles, local fare, cereal, lots of fruit, yogurt, free newspaper.  Toilet does not have a fan and really stinks up the room after use, need to open window to expel the foul miasma. Floor near shower gets wet but there is a towel provided for the floor. The room can get cold even if you shut off the air conditioner. The gym is not large but open 24 hours. Bring a set a pajamas or sweat pants/sweatshirt just in case. Tell the  driver to approach from the Ministry of Manpower so that he can take you to the hotel lobby directly to avoid a U-turn and a longer ride and",4,0.3411

"everything was good, few mins walk to MRT, Clarke Quay, Chinatown. Lots of food and shopping choices around.  personally I feel the bed is too soft, the semi-open restroom is not my cup of tea. I like the side couch next to the window.",4,0.6597
Very nice Hotel nearby Clark Quay and the Bay. The MRT Station ist just over the street. The service was very good! I will come back next year and for sure I will choose the Regis Park Hotel for may stay!,5,0.847

"Hotel is comfortable and staff was efficient and nice. The pool is excellent. It is strange to have lobby on 3rd floor and restaurant on 1st, right next to the lifts.

"Great location, within easy walking distance of Clarke Quay. Hotel was good value, our room was a little on the small side and not nearly enough wardrobe space for 2 adults. Single wardrobe with 6 hangers!",4,0.9117
Good location for biz. Close to downtown but also convenient for Clarke and boar Quay. Hotel functional clean and tidy. Easy and good for a quick biz trip..no frills but perfect for a quick stop over.,4,0.9473
"Stayed here for 2 nights. Nice hotel, spotless and very good service from all staff. The room layout is a bit odd with lack of privacy when one person getting dressed or in bathroom. The rooms are also quite small. I didn't like the limited smoking area only outside the hotel in a tiny corner. There was an empty unused platform by pool that could have been used? Overall nice hotel but i would try somewhere else on my next visit.",4,0.2126
I have stayed here many times over recent years and have always enjoyed my stays.  This time the service was shocking and the new kitchen/breakfast/restaurant the food is terrible. I wont be staying here again.,1,-0.3612
"Great location, close to most attractions and best of all, it’s only a 5 minute walk to Clarke Quay. The only downside is the breakfast, we only paid for 2 days, and we missed 1 as the food was very average, uncooked bacon, they don’t cook the eggs the way you want, waffles were old and hard as a rock. Other than food, it’s a great place to stay in. ",4,0.9254
"Stayed at the Park Regis during the Grand Prix weekend. Chose the hotel based on the walking distance to the track (along the riverside) and the pricing given the high demand during the race weekend. The first Park Queen Room we were offered was quite grim; there wasn't much of an outlook or natural light, and the decor was very dated. Due to the length of stay, we requested an alternative room which appeared slightly updated and was overlooking the adjoining mosque which was preferable.  The standard room is fairly generic with a queen bed, flat TV etc but the bay window is a nice touch. The layout with the ""open bathroom"" is a little annoying for a couple in terms of privacy etc, but its workable.  We did not have the daily breakfast or eat in the ground floor restaurant.

"This is our second stay here.  The hotel is in great location near Clarke Quay and a 1,5km walk to the Marina Bay. Grabs are easy to attain. It is well insulated against the external noise and allowed for a sleep in after a night out. Definitely will return to this venue for future visits!",4,0.902
"I have nothing bad to say about this hotel. There's a catwalk in front of the hotel that connects to the Metro, which gives you east access to the places that aren't within walking distance. I really enjoyed my stay here. ",5,0.7538
Great location only 5 mins walk from Clarke Quay and China Town. 2min walk to underground station. Hotel has a welcoming atmosphere friendly helpful staff outdoor pool  so  relaxing after a day's sightseeing. breakfast plenty of choice for every taste. ,5,0.9525
"Stayed here for 4 nights in October, in their standard double room.   Hotel is in a good location, being only 10 mins walk to the bars and restaurants along the river.  Room was a typical city/business style, - clean and adequate.  Accommodation in Singapore isn’t cheap, - and for the price I paid, - you would get a lot more elsewhere in Asia, - put the price seems average/fair for the area.  Breakfast was nothing to write home about, - though I’d prefer if the coffee was a stronger Italian style, rather that the insipid American sort. Staff were courteous and professional.   Overall, my stay was fine.  The only annoyances were being woken in the morning as a lady was shouting down the corridor asking if any room wanted their laundry done !! Also, although the hotel has a pool",3,0.8395
The hotel is centrally located.  Waking distance to Chinatown and Clark Quay.  Close proximity to Marina Bay Hotel/Garden/Marlion/etc.  The staffs are very friendly and the hotel is so clean.  I didn't specify any room when booked but they gave us a room with two balconies.  One of the balcony takes you to the swimming pool.  ,5,0.5411

Poor quality hotel but all the staff were amazing and friendly and helpful.rooms at hotel very small and poor design.location was good close to clarke key.on the whole i would say a three star hotel  breakfast selection was poor needs more choice need to cater more for guests with special dietary requirements,3,0.7756
"I stayed here for 4 nights on a business trip. The staff were welcoming, helpful and efficient. Location is great; close to Clarke Quay and 200m from an MRT station. The room was comfortable with a good bed and sufficient room. Minibar and coffee making facilities (which I did not use) and good wifi in the room and in the lobby. Breakfast (buffet) is sufficient with a mix of western and oriental foods. I did not dine in the hotel. I would stay there again.",5,0.9674
"The Park Regis is in a good location with access to a few metro stations and walking distance to the excellent Clarke Quay complex of food and beverages plus night life. The room was excellent, clean and secure. The swimming pool was refreshing and with pool towels available from the gym area right next to it, helped us to have a wonderful experience in Singapore on our first trip and despite a big wide world, a place we will go back to.",5,0.959
"The hotel is in a great location in the center of Singapore. The hotel staff are extremely friendly. But I was forced to search for another room. Specifically, the hotel claims that their rooms are built in an ""open concept"" style. The toilet, shower and bed are all in the same space. The toilet door only partially and visually separates the space between the bed and the toilet! I could not accept a room where I sleep only a meter away from the toilet, which does not have the ability to completely close the door. At my insistence, I was given another room, this staff was very willing to respond to my request. My suggestion is to make the hotel clearly indicate on its Web site the characteristics of rooms that are ""open concept"" Talking to other hotel guests, I realized that they",3,0.664

"All hotel staff extremely pleasant and more than helpful, be it at Concierge, Reception and the restaurant staff, with the exception of (not sure of his name) one male staff, who was stationed at the bar in the afternoons, seemed to be irritated and was a little rude by the fact that I had not returned an ice bucket from our room when I asked him for a bucket of ice again the next day - I advised him I thought the cleaning staff may return it to the bar, but he barked at me it was not their responsibility, it was mine, which clearly I was not aware of! Consequently I brought the empty ice bucket back to the bar the next day.  Other than that particular grumpy male, could not fault the hotel staff.
