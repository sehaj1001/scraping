"We attended just before the travel restrictions imposed due to the corona virus. The staff were very friendly and helped us to book attractions as well as giving us some masks. They always helped out with getting taxis and giving us information. The bed was a bit hard but they provided a mattress topper which helped. We stayed here for five days and on two of those, they forgot to bring us toiletries. The tv remote batteries had to be replaced as the cursor did not work. It was good that you could use youtube on the tv.There was an electrical problem in the room as every time the light switches were flicked and the tv was on, it would make a cracking noise and when my partner touched an adapter near the tv he got an electric shock. They did have someone fix it the next day which",1,0.3912
"Guess doing a staycation this time is tough but it shows how well the hotel management is trying to cope with the quick changing situation. I managed to stay in both a club room and also a family room. The Club Room was on Level 5 which has direct access to the pool and a nice courtyard (other club rooms are on the higher floor), the family room had 2 queen size bed and a bathtub which was great for the kids although the room design is a little dated. They have themed rooms which I think is much better, so will try those rooms next time.  This staycation was actually a birthday celebration for my girl and they were very nice to give a complimentary slice of cake and also some balloons too. Kudos to the team.. As for the Club Lounge at the Waterfall Lounge, very simple canapes",4,0.9828
"The worst receptionist ever,  they MIX REGULAR GUEST AND ISOLATED CASE ON SAME FLOOR?  irregardless what they claimed they are extremely clueless to what they're doing.  Thrash of these isolated people are left out of their room the whole night with their used plastic container left on hall way...  The sudden log book , conveniently placed in case these isolated people goes out.  Reception lied , claimed constant housekeeping spraying disinfectant, NONE HAPPENED, in fact both on 26 and 27 at 0845 a note was slipped under the door ""receipt written was here at 1300""   *photos of isolated guests used thrash from their meals left out on the hallway entire night.  Bento box order form for this isolated people.  Gym log book for two days was not updated nor checked by hotel staff. So",1,-0.9624
"We are both disabled, my partner is totally blind and I am in a wheelchair, which can make travel difficult. But from the time we got out of the cab we wanted for nothing, the staff were all amazing, so helpful and considerate, they have ramps up to the resturant . I really must mention 1 member of staff who went beyond the call of duty, Sanjiv, he even accompanied us to the airport and got all our luggage booked in for us and he also bought us a cup of tea, thank you so much, we will never forget you and our stay at Furama RiverFront.

A stopover before heading back to England has given us a great oppurtunity to stay in this wonderful hotel. Lobby structure was extraordinary and the facilities built in it living up to it's expectations. Stayed in the deluxe room and the city view from 16th floor was awesome. Check-in was pretty quick and was attended by Sanjiv as he was very friendly and accommodating. Sanjiv's above and beyond attribute to help us get a room immediately knowing me being pregnant was a beauty of his hospitality nature. Would never forget this trip and certainly to return to this place for longer stay.,5,0.9833
"I had to cancel my booking with Furama RiverFront Hotel due to not being able to enter the country because of Coronavirus restrictions.  Even though this was done at the earliest time when this information became available, they have decided that I am eligible for a refund.  This does nor sit well with me and in good faith I can't recommend your book with this company. Unfortunately I have no idea what the hotel was like, they wouldn't let me into their country.",1,-0.0834
"I booked this because it was promoted as a “ newly renovated hotel “ on Agoda and the pictures looked good. It also said there was a city view. All a huge misrepresentation.  When I checked in, I asked if I could have a room in the new block but they said they were fully booked (yeah right).  I went up to the room and was shocked by everything. Even though it was non-smoking, the moment you step out of the lift, the entire floor and room just reeks of stale cigarettes. The room furnishing is so old and nothing like the photos. Floor carpet looks gross, bath tub is yellow, view is terrible.   I went back down and asked if I could change a room because of the smell, they again said they can’t do anything about it. It’s the first time I ever encountered such unhelpful staff in a",1,-0.9241
"Initially we were meant to stay in the classic rooms but it’s just too run down. The executive room however was amazing. The best part of our trip was definitely the staffs. Every point of contact I felt welcomed. At the check in, the lady was extremely pleasant and assisted every step of the way. However the best part for me were the 3 staff(syed,Sanjiv and a lady in the picture). They were very welcoming and brought smiles upon my husband’s face especially since it was his birthday. It’s the small touches that made his day and honestly so happy to see such kind and happy faces greeting us with a song. Thank you all! Besides that the room was incredibly large and comfortable . Overall I would recommend a stay in the executive room, not the classics",4,0.9978
"I was staying in Furama Riverfront Hotel recently. This hotel is located just a stone throw away from the Clarke Quay which is teamed with upbeat international restaurants and also watering holes for the yuppies.  This hotel has a very nice cafe with a very a garden as backdrop and a small waterfall This hotel provides a good spread of buffet breakfast at a very reasonable price and also a huge swimming pool which is well maintained. The staff in this hotel is well trained and helpful despite the fact that there must be a cutting down of staff during this season of much uncertainty. I would like to specially highlight Miss Lisa, the hotel manager who has been especially helpful and professional in ensuring that we have a good stay in this hotel.",4,0.9661
"Everything was great especially your swimming pool. My kids really enjoy themselves. We are a frequent staycation family, by far your pool is the best! Plus all the staff are friendly &amp; helpful. Our late check out request was granted without much question asked! Thank you Furama!",5,0.9725
Had a 2D1N staycation with friends in the family room. Bed was very comfortable but limited TV channels. (Only local channels) Ants started coming after we placed our snacks on table. Toilet had a foul smell. Breakfast was good and very crowded. ,3,0.6653
"3 day stopover at our favourite Singapore hotel. After nearly 2 years it was a great surprise to walk into the new foyer. Gone are the reception desk and shops, replaced by bright white decor, childrens' playground, snack dispenser machines and check-in consoles. All very modern. (Hello Kitty). The rooms and service are still at a very high level and make for a comfortable stay. The Waterfall Lounge is still the place for that afternoon or evening drink and snack with great attentive staff. Staying in an Executive Club room provides for a great breakfast and evening drink and snacks in the Lounge. Well worth it. Had dinner one night at the Indonesian restaurant Kintamani which was very disappointing. They could not find an al-a-carte menu so we chose the buffet and were then",4,0.9643
"Was having drinks and some bites at the lounge. Yazid service at waterfall lounge is excellent, he is super courteous and friendly.love to be attended by him.  he is an asset to furama riverfront hotel. thankyou for the awesome service.",5,0.9552
The hotel was looking great with the kid's playground set up at the corner was an amazing idea. Felt more like in a mall than a hotel and really loved it. The service extended to us was one of the best we experienced as a family especially Sanjiv who was very attentive to all our doubts and gave us many suggestions to go around singapore and made us clear with our plans to travel to Legoland in Malaysia as well. The kids were in love with his kiddie attitude towards them. An unforgettable memory for all of us and would come back again for sure to this great place with extraordinary service.,5,0.9863
"A well-appointed hotel with good facilities, welcoming, helpful and friendly staff. Not sure I liked the open-plan reception desks - never sure which one to queue up at. The pool was a pleasant temperature. The Indonesian Buffet was excellent. Lots of choice, well laid out and there were some wonderful tastes and flavours on offer. ",4,0.9604
"Staff on arrival were friendly and although it was 7.30 am they allowed us to check in, our room was one which had been upgraded, it overlooked the pool and was quiet, clean and comfortable. We did have an issue with a leak in the bathroom and staff did their best to stop it but couldn’t, it wasn’t a big problem to us. Breakfast was not brilliant, the hot food is not hot, it’s kept under lights which do nothing except maintain a tepid temperature. They really need to invest in decent hot plates.  It was a good location to walk to the nearby riverfront where we ate at Bar Bar Black Sheep, an excellent eatery.",4,0.7644
"I usually book hotels directly through their website. Unfortunately it slipped through my mind this time as I was racing for time to catch some rest. Booked this hotel through Agoda for a superior room with one Double Bed.   Arrive at the hotel to be told that a double bedded room was not available. I have to apologise that I was very grumpy at that time after a Long days work.   A big big thank you to the FO Executive and the Manager in duty. Your kind gesture goes a Long way. Your hotel staffs has shown their hospitality. Even though reviews here are mixed with old rooms, mine was very clean. Thank you for patiently serving this grumpy guest of yours.

"We stayed at this hotel for one night en route to Perth, and for a further four nights, when we returned. The lobby/foyer area looks very impressive. Upon our initial arrival, we were told that we had been upgraded to an ‘Executive Suite’ on the 9th floor. We were understandably excited as to what it would be like, however, when we opened the door, we just saw a very tired looking standard room. The only modern feature was a glass sided bathroom/shower/toilet....hardly and executive suite. Upon our return visit, we were allocated a straightforward room, and I asked at check-in for four additional pillows as the beds were so hard. I was assured they would be delivered, but after a couple of hours, still they had not materialised so I had to call reception and complain before they",3,-0.039
"Overall I would rate my stay here 6/10.  Things I love: 1. Staying in executive club rooms entitled us to free flow drinks (inc alcohol from 6-8pm). 2. The room was clean and neat. 3. Service was good. Knowing that it was a birthday celebration, they offered a complimentary slice of cake.  Things that require improvement: 1. The room that we stayed had a faulty bathtub. The water drainage had some issues and our room's carpet was soaked. Management was alerted but I had to urge them to change a room for us.   2. The breakfast was quite a disaster. We didn't like the idea that they had bananas and poached egg on french toast. The American breakfast was microwaved and the egg yolk become rock solid 3.

Firstly I'm kinda piss of, coz we are not being told that the waterfall lounge is been transfer at the level 2 when we arrived at the hotel and also it didn't stated that your hotel has a event going on at the lounge through your website. If we know that week has a events been going on, we will not book it and might change to another week. Sadly to said, i have been recommended by my Friends that this hotel has a good service and also the waterfall lounge is damn nice and that's why i wanna celebrate my 3rd year anniversary with my partner in this hotel and wanted to show her of what of my Friends told me how great it is but its not of what i have been expecting.

Nice hotel. Friendly staff from recep Kartini and the breakfast waiter Salim. They really accommodate to my request. Of all the hotels I've stayed Furama quality of bathtub is different from the rest. They really maintaned it well. No scratches or stains at all.

"Booked an Executive Suite at Furama Riverfront for a few days on the way back from Sri Lanka as it was a great experience last time we stayed.  Arrived early in the morning after an all night flight and were pleased that we were given a room immediately as we really needed some sleep. We had booked a suite as we wanted some comfort ,space and also access to the executive club .We opened the door and it was like a time warp.We were back on the 80's. Dull furniture,dull dark flooring,dull bedroom carpet and old style marble bathroom and this is the top of their range suite !!!! .We dropped our bags and hit the bed Unfortunately the bed should have been retired years ago and was lumpy,hard and totally worn out ,you could actually hear the springs groaning under you..A refreshing",1,0.8113

Unfortunately, due to unforeseen circumstances, one of our rooms was delayed by almost 3 hours. There were other issues as well that made me feel very disappointed. When I went to the looby, I requested to speak to the Duty Manager. At this point, I was already very disappointed.  The manager, Mr Lakshman approached me with a smile and sincerely listened to my complaints on certain disappointments. He assured me that my anninversary plans would not be spoilt because of the issues. He then looked at the computer screen and was searching for a way to turn around my disappointment.

Not really on the Riverfront but river in walking distance but lots of renovations outside maybe it was on the river many years ago!  Stayed here for 5 nights with 2 daughters. Had a family room separate beds. Beds and towels very clean. Room could do with an update. No check in desk but individual stations staff helpful. Front of hotel chaps were very helpful and friendly indeed always happy to see us return and give advice on where we could visit next. Breakfast was included and good value. Pool area very nice. Bar area and waterfalll very relaxing to sit in. Overall this was excellent value for money paid.,4,0.993
The hotel was in a good position and close to china town. a good 15 min walk. The hotel pool is excellent and we had great times there.

"We came back here for our Wedding Anniversary after staying here on our honeymoon 25 years ago. Although Singapore had changed dramatically in that time the level of service at this hotel had not it was fantastic, the staff could not do enough for you! In the Waterfall Lounge we received free drinks &amp; snacks between 6 &amp; 8pm and breakfast as we had booked an Executive room, this was brilliant as drinks and food in Singapore are expensive! We have to make a special note of Yasid in the Waterfall Lounge who made our stay there even more enjoyable and we had many a good chat in the evenings  when he often gave us good tips as to where to go to eat",5,0.9473

"Myself, my brother, and father was staying here for 3 nights. On arrival was a pleasant welcome with a lovely modern reception. After checking in and getting to our room there was only a double bed and a single bed, housekeeping shortly followed after to set up a 3rd bed. The 3rd bed was shockingly small and when laying down my feet and above my ankles were hanging over the end, I simply went to reception to explain in a polite manor that the bed was too small. The receptionist bluntly told me that it was standard with no apology or any intention of any sympathy. After around 10 minutes of debate as to whether or not the size of the bed was an acceptable standard i was given the option to look at an other room that in fact had 3 single beds, however upon entering the room i",1,0.9042

Also much thought on children's playground at ground floor next to reception also in The Square Restaurant. The Waterfall Lounge is an improvement with much natural lights through big area of glass panels. The equipment in the gym were new.

"I have done a last minute online booking of the room through a third party site and arrived for check in at about 2 hours later.  The Lobby Layout was confusing as I was unable to find clear and/or distinct signs that direct me to the front desks. When I found the front desk, I realised it was hidden behind a pillar 'strategically'. The Front Office staffs were friendly, nonetheless, and the check-in process was hassle-free.  The room I received was with dated decoration, furniture and colour scheme. There was a huge stench of dust, probably from the carpeted floor and I was sneezing the whole night since I was allergic to dust mites. The beds were comfortable and clean, however, the bathtub was not well maintained with chip-offs from the surface. I could hear the water tap",3,0.8265
"After leaving the NCL Jade, we arrived (very early) at the hotel and were offered an upgrade for $90 which included a club room, early check-in and late check out as well as 2 hours of free drinks and snacks in the Waterfall lounge. This was an easy decision due to the high cost of drinks in Singapore and was the bargain of this trip. The food was excellent and the drinks were free flowing and included imported bottled cider and lager. The Waterfall lounge is a beautiful place and the waitress’s ensured your glass was never empty, it definitely added extra value. The room upgrade even included a Wi-Fi hotspot to provide uninterrupted internet access across Singapore. All in all a lovely comfortable, friendly hotel close to all amenities.",4,0.9849

The best thing about Furama, apart from the generous cocktails, beverages and canapés that were included with our room, were the staff.  We were taken care of, every night, by Yazid and Salim in the waterfall lounge and could not have annoyed ourselves more.  Both being hotel chefs back in Melbourne, the customer service that we received from both of these gentlemen was absolutely outstanding.

Understood the hotel was already fifteen years ago, did not expect the standards of luxury. Upon arrival at the reception, first impression was the ambience was bright and clean, open concept. We were met with warmly smiling ladies  and requested for a nice clean room for a eleven night stay. Pretty reasonable but unfortunately our first room 1501 was miserable.

"The hotel is modern, in fact ultra modern in its room decor. Our Executive Club room had a glass walled bathroom with separate shower cladded in stone with washbasin in the bedroom. Minimal hanging space suitable for business or overnight visitor. Oversized bed with plenty of space. However, to use the room proved impractical. The hairdryer was sited near the washbasin mirror which had poor lighting and meant standing to dry your hair. This had to be used also to put on make-up and if you didn’t have your own small mirror didn’t assist in getting up close for eyeliner etc. There was a desk and chair but no mirror over it. The lighting was poor, in line with many other corporate style hotels.   Now for the good points. Executive Club entitles you to have a small buffet styled",4,-0.631
If you are going on a cruise and you are looking for an inexpensive hotel close by the cruise terminal the Furama Riverside Hotel is a good juice. There are lots of local restaurants around in this area as well as China Town. The hotel has a buffet restaurant on the second floor with lots of seafood choices. I ordered a la carte and I have to say the “Thai Royal Seafood To Yum soup was outstanding and so was the Singapore Laksa.,5,0.8402
It's a basic and a decent hotel although on Havelock road which is a little away from any of the metro stations or the city centers for shopping but the bus stop is nearby with a good frequency and on time buses. The rooms were clean although not very big and service was prompt and pleasant. Breakfast spread was also good.,4,0.9313
What kind of service would you expect when you have just 2 staff working at front desk in a hotel with so many rooms??Every time we visited at the desk people kept waiting because they were under staffed Infact Front desk was handling concierge game too..with just 2 of them.

I was like ‘what’! Was super duper obliged and pleasantly taken by the hospitality of the hotel staff. The room was awesome with the view from the 19th unprecedented. Throughout stay we saw it was not just us all the folk we spoke to also raved about the service and personal care shown by all the staff members.

Go for Club Room / Club Benefits if you want to enhance your stay by a mile (i.e. Breakfast at Lounge, Evening Cocktails, All Day Coffee/Tea/Drinks at Lounge) is worth the bill)  4.

"Pleasant as the staff are for the most part, the overpriced food is consistently either cold or barely warm when it should be hot. The rooms are poorly maintained. Rust in the sink with flaking off enamel. A light fell out of the ceiling in the bathroom. The worst thing is the air conditioning. We kept getting the maintenance men in but there was nothing to be done. It could not be made low enough so that after braving the Singapore humidity there was no escape from the heat. Apparently some floors are worse than others. One colleague couldn’t get his aircon 28 degrees. However another could get his to 22 degrees. I do not recommend this hotel unless you’re impervious to heat, are satisfied with cold food purchased at excessive expense and can tolerate poor maintenance",1,-0.7839

"We spent New Year in this hotel. Room was ok, clean and brand new, location is great too. Accessible to MRT, bus, shopping centres etc  Unfortunately, I will only rate this hotel as average because some of the staffs are not very professional. Got to be careful when you book your room and breakfast. Always get the services you required in writing because some of the staffs might forget to list down the services or even forget to reply back to your emails. I had to chase up the hotel for a refund for breakfast and it spoiled my holidays in Singapore  Breakfast is average. Same dishes everyday. No variety and it is expensive.

There are many plus points for this hotel so I will just start with the negative and that is only that it is a 15 plus minute walk to the nearest MRT station . We preferred to walk to Fort Canning MRT as that was a pleasanter walk along Robertson Quay rather than along to busy road to Outram MRT.

It was our first time in Singapore and we arrived on a very early flight from the UK . Our travel agent had requested an early check in but we knew that it could only be a request and not guaranteed.
