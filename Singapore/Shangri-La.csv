"Fantastic hotel set amidst 15 acres of tropical landscaped gardens. Very near to Orchard Road. Excellent customer service. The room is clean, beautiful and spacious. Strong WiFi signal in the room without troublesome login. Very comfortable mattress and pillow. Top quality toiletries.

Had an amazing 2 night stay at the Shangri-la! Visited with my 2 year old daughter and wife this hotel is perfect for business travellers and families alike.   The breakfast was amazing with a great selection. We were fortunate it be in the newly renovated family floor which is perfect for anyone travelling with kids ,5,0.9729
We were greeted by a welcoming vibe even during this period of CV19.   Stayed at the family room for 3d2n.   There was a playcation package ongoing and also one for golden circles member.   We stayed on level 7 all the way towards the end.   The room was clean and spacious with a private balcony where we had our room service.   Perfect for family with children as well. We brought our daughter and had a great time at the pool.   Food at The Line was good as it is. Buffet breakfast was fantastic as well.   Will recommend anyone that wants a short getaway! :),5,0.9834
"Was really looking forward to coming back to our favorite staycay in town when we checked in for a 4 night stay at the Valley Wing (to support local tourism since our flights all got grounded), but sad to say, it was off to a depressing start in here. I’m in on night 4 and will be checking out tomorrow, and still nothing has changed my mind about ever coming back again. Says a lot since this is our third or fourth stay with Valley Wing, and we used to love coming back to the welcoming environment and great team.  Our check-in was quite literally two parallel conversations going on. There was no effort to understand my question, nor was there an urgency to offer a solution. Neither was any apologies offered for my having gotten 2 conflicting pieces of information from the",3,0.8481

"I love this hotel! Everyone here is so nice and helpful. I had a room in the garden wing which I would highly recommend because I had a lovely terrace. Had room service out there one night and it was so nice. Breakfast is amazing. I usually don't like buffets but this one was great. The hotel is in a beautiful neighborhood and you can walk to a lot of places from the hotel. I walked to shopping and the botanical gardens. The lobby area is really beautiful. My bed was so comfortable, bathroom was nice and I had plenty of storage in the room. The only negative about the hotel is that the pool was full of screaming children and service at the pool was pretty non-existent. I had to flag someone down to order a drink and something to eat.",5,0.9904

"This is our second stay at the valley wing after a wonderful visit last year.The reception was fantastic carlito welcomed us back followed by edward and raja! We were overwhelmed yet again it was so nice to see them  it wouldn't be the same without them,the lovely zilla showed us up to the room and they had remembered it was out anniversary so there was wine,a cake and chocolates plus the bed decorated with swans and flowers.The summit room for breakfast is superb a real treat and Dominique is great we had a great time,the valley wing is like no where else elegant without being stuffy,the afternoon tea and canapes are of the highest quality and drinking verve clique just makes it so special. The staff are the stars here who make you feel wonderful, govinda who looked after us",5,0.9894
"My wife and I have stayed at the Shangri-la every two or three years since 1987.   For many years, it was the hotel of choice for professionals, especially when staying in the Horizon Club.   For the extra cost, one got excellent well-appointed rooms, and a degree of exclusive service in the breakfast and Club areas  On our recent trip, we found that the room had been redesigned, probably by someone who had never stayed there.  The bathroom is smaller, with the shower in a so-called wet-room area with a slippery floor, which could be dangerous.  A former feature used to be the full size bath-tub in which one could relax,  but this has been replaced by a small steep-sided one which is difficult to get out of.    For some reason, a small induction hob has been added to the",4,-0.1901
"We booked the Premium Balcony Suite for an overnight stay.  This suite has a spacious outdoor area with a jacuzzi and BBQ pit.  Understandably, BBQ food has to be prepared by the hotel - they will have their staff up there grilling for you.  We had some friends over to spend the evening together.  What was great was they found out it was for a birthday, and had the room decorated beautifully.  It was great!  The staff were warm and friendly.  And very helpful.    Thank you, Rei Kimura, Guest Relations for your thoughtfulness, and Arif who put the final touches, and the hard working House keeping team.    ",5,0.9829
"Celebrated my husband's birthday at Rose Veranda. The waitresses are all friendly, helpful and patience.

Thank you to all the staff at Rose Veranda.",5,0.9803
It has been a while - we came back for a staycation. It was a bit disappointed to find that the service level was dropped. Put a remark on the booking and the hotel emailed back that they have taken note of that. But no one was aware of it during check-in at the horizon club and throughout the stay.,2,-0.6486
"We have been staying at Shangri-la, Valley Wing, for many years and the hotel is just amazing with outstanding service.  It is a fantastic hotel for both business and pleasure.  For at least 15 years I have been staying at the hotel and for the last 3 years I have brought the whole family (kids and grandchildren) with me and we all love it.  We all feel treated like royalties in a fairytale!   The staff is providing a service beyond any expectations. In particular I would like to mention Raja, Dominique, Carlito, Khalid and Mitchell for always looking after us in the Valley Wing and Chandra at the pool. Whatever you ask for, they do their outmost to provide. They are unique and make the hotel special!  Thank you again for a wonderful stay and experience.  The grandchildren love",5,0.9899

"Our little Poppy’s Birthday was during the peak of the COVID19 pandemic. All the bookings that we’ve made were cancelled by the venue one by one. And to TOP it all off, we weren’t able to cancel the cakes, decorations and favours that we’ve booked. Shangri La was a last minute booking, and it was the best decision we ever made!  The Customer Service team, led by Yana were amazing. First and foremost, she was successful in making a hyper stressed up mum feel settled and assured that her princess is going to have a birthday she would remember. And the team at Shangri La delivered!   Right at check in, Yana and her team made Poppy feel really special welcoming her with little squirrel plushies and goody bags.

Arrived 21at Feb for a seven day stay. This is our second visit and we were not disappointed.We were booked into the garden wing and the room was of the usual high standard.The breakfast in the Line buffet restaurant was excellent and the staff very attentive.

"Arrived at the hotel during the coronavirus period and were reassured by the diligence and attention to detail from the staff with respect to control measures.  The reception staff warmly welcomed us and processed us very quickly to our rooms.  We stayed in Horizon Club deluxe rooms and they were very comfortable and clean rooms.  The bathroom facilities were excellent with good quality toiletries.  The Horizon Club was just what we needed after a flight from the Uk and it really was our home for the three night stay.  The quality and variety of food and drink available for breakfast, afternoon tea and dinner was very good.  Don't be put off by the location as it is only a 15 minute taxi ride to the bay area and a 5-10 minute walk to the shops on Orchard Road. Thoroughly enjoyed",5,0.9827
The Valley Wing was stunning. The staff could not to enough and the gardens are beautiful. Rivals the Sydney Shangri-la as my favourite hotel. We will come back if we can and will certainly choose this above other places to stay in Singapore ,5,0.836

"Into our third day at this fabulous hotel. All the staff are courteous, helpful and happy, this makes a real difference to your experience. The hotel itself is lovely. We are enjoying the Horizon Club which is great, a very nice private lounge with plenty of variation in food and drink. The pool area is also a pleasure and welcome in this heat. Singapore is fairly quiet at the moment as you would probably expect but suits us, no queues, no hassle just relaxed. Definitely recommend this great hotel.",5,0.9843

Lovely hotel and lovey staff. Due to corona hotel and attractions relatively quiet but lots of monitoring in place both in the hotel all attraction and shopping mall. Hotel quite expensive for food and drink but there are restaurants within 10 minutes walk.,5,0.8074
We loved our stay. The pool is beautiful. The pool and hotel staff are very helpful and welcoming. We were upgraded to a room with club floor privileges.

"We had stayed at Shangri-La Singapore Orange Grove for few times but this stay was the best. The Asst. Guest Relations Manager, Mica Villasenor surprised us with cake, balloons, flower petals and swan decorations to celebrate our 20th Wedding Anniversary at our room. We had a very special private dinner celebration at The Orchid Diner de Fleur inside Shangrila by Chef Hun. He prepared a very exquisite 5 course set menu that really set the tone for the wonderful evening. Not to mention,  we were pampered by the great service of Steven.  We had never imagined that there is an enchanted place at this hotel. We highly recommend to stay at Shangrila Singapore. ",5,0.9908
"Going beyond our wildest expectations. The Magnificent Shangri la team made our stay sweet and memorable. Requested to celebrate my wife’s birthday with a cake delivered to the room saying I’ll pay for it but they offered it with compliments! Breakfast at the line was wonderful and had so many selections, even the fussiest diner would be spoilt for choice. Our time at the horizon club was awesome and the place exudes class, definitely be there for the afternoon tea selection and the evening canapés ! The hotel itself is also magnificent and there are so many things to see within it itself! Won’t spoil everything, you have to stay to find out! Shangri la hotel Singapore definitely ticks all the boxes of excellence in my list! ",5,0.9918
"My husband and I spent two nights in the Garden Wing. We absolutely love the experience. Even though the hotel is in the middle of the city, it felt like being in the botanical garden. The ground was well kept. The public areas were stylishly decorated and one could see that there was great attention to detail. The hotel staff were very courteous and friendly, and they seem to always know what we need. Our room was amazingly quiet and we were able to get a good night’s sleep. We highly recommend this hotel!",5,0.9782
The breakfast buffet was the largest we've ever seen.  It's just not huge but very well chosen articles and the quality was excellent. Only complaint about the breakfast is the coffee service.  You can make much better coffee by yourself using Nespresso machines which are available there.  Room and bathroom very nicely renovated. Only complain in that sector comes from the age of the hotel. Almost 50 years ago room height was lower and there is not enough natural light in the room.  One thing I suggest is please remove those large writing desks which are totally blocking the windows and takes the last spacious feeling away.  The incoming experience was one the best. Whole lobby level staff is so awesome. Every time we were around there someone noticed us and came to talk. There,4,0.97
"My husband and I recently stayed five nights in Junior Suite at the Singapore Shangri-La.  Despite the corona virus scare, they handled themselves in a professional and secure fashion.  We sampled the lobby restaurant and Shang Palace and had fantastic meals(Peking Duck was the best in Singapore).  Special thanks to Zoe in the Horizon Club for making our stay memorable!

"We were here for 1 night for the last leg of our honeymoon and wow what a way to end the trip. We were blown away by the lobby and the beauty of it. After a temperature check (in light of Coronavirus) we were given a complimentary chilled smoothie and a free upgrade to a garden room for our honeymoon! What an incredible room it was with flowers, a card, a towel swan on the bed and a chocolate cake sent to the room for us!  The bathroom had the usual complementaries and we enjoyed the shower. My husband said that the gym was fab and the pool was huge and relaxing. We went for a wander around the hotel and it is stunning especially the waterfall and coy carp/turtles!! We loved The Line restaurant for the lunch buffet and to be honest, cannot fault this hotel. We only wish we could",5,0.991
"We were amazed at everything at this hotel, from the exotically dressed doorman who was so very helpful getting all our heavy bags out of the Uber, to the very friendly front desk, and the beautiful infinity pool sculpture they have in the lobby.  We were even given orchids as we were shown to the elevator!   There is a beautiful little garden area with a small waterfall and pond with koi fish.  Everything was absolutely five stars all the way.  I'm so glad my sister's friend recommended it to us!   We did not do the breakfast as there are so many wonderful places to eat for very little money in Singapore.

"We spent 5 nights at this hotel with our 2 grandchildren, twins aged 3, together with their parents and maids, checking into 3 rooms of their Horizon Club.  The hotel was somewhat dated, however we did check in their Tower Wing, which was recently renovated. Even then, the rooms were not luxurious as I would expect from the Shangri La hotel chain and for some inexplicable reasons, the placement of the king bed was at a 45 degree angle, which made the room very odd indeed.  The hotel was not child friendly at all - the playroom was on a paid to use basis, something like Singapore $70 for a 3 hour use and only admit one accompanying adult. The Horizon Club (more about that later) was not opened to children between 5-8pm and when they were allowed to enter, they were confined to a",2,-0.2313

"The brand Shangri-la has always lived up to its reputation, and this one is no exception but there are a few rough edges during our short stay here last Christmas.  Check-in was a breeze, and the room was probably one of the finest available in the 5-star category in the whole of Singapore.  No disappointment there.  When we wanted to get a quick bite on the night of our arrival, the Shophouse patisserie proved to be our first surprise.  Not only was the shop assistant unfamiliar with the range of their pastries and cakes available, she was also ill at ease at answering our questions on them.  Granted the products on show seemed attractive enough but without proper introduction/recommendations, we had to settle for a couple of donuts (which were delicious).  As a member of the",4,-0.0772

There is a wide variety of food and it was sumptuous. Thank You Shangri-La for the wonderful experience. We would surely stay here again, 🥂 cheers!",5,0.9163

I loved the horizontal safe - so much easier to access and a vanity unit with mirror and hair dryer - designed for female guests!

The first room I was assigned which was a pool side facing - a non-smoking room - actually smelled like cigarettes so bad that I asked for a room change (I am allergic).  The second room which was supposed to be a King Size bed was a room with two single beds pushed together not pool side facing, but finally the third room was what I had expected....King size, Pool side facing.

Well away from the River, Chinatown, Little India &amp; Marina Bay so you'll need a taxi or Metro to get to those places.

The hotel facilities and staff are great. But doing a block booking for a seminar for overseas visitors was not as smooth as I had expected. I had chosen Shangri La based on my past great experience staying there and was disappointed with the standard of the booking system that I had to intervened on behalf of my overseas guests. I had envisioned that once the special booking code was allocated all my guests would be able to do their own bookings.

"Oh what a hotel.   The staff is amazing, the amenities are amazing, the benefits if you have Amex FHR is amazing.   Most importantly they are true 5 star service. This being as I have an allergy to garlic and onions and even so called 5 star hotels refuse to make certain things without garlic and onion as it’s “pre done.”  They have specially catered to me which is a major plus beyond measure.   They have many restaurants, a barber on property and so many amenities. If you have Amex FHR they don’t just give breakfast complimentary but also afternoon tea.   I could immediately know this hotel would knock it out of the park for me.  Thank you ",5,0.9306
We stayed here for the New year. We were not disappointed. We were offered a room in the Horizon Club set. As we were on BandB basis this arrangement worked superbly for us. We were able to fill the day without stopping and then relax in the Club lounge  With complimentary drinks and canapés while deciding on Dining venues. Hotel immaculate. Food top class. I don’t believe we shall ever stay any where else in Singapore. Well done to all the staff,5,0.8933
This appearance of this hotel was grand. However the services from check in and ALL the restaurants were AWFUL! We would get our main course before the appetizers. Our kids food would come out last. The waiters would forget to bring certain plates.. We had to make several reminders to waiters inquiring about late plates. Mind you asking for ketchup and waiting for it the length we did was noticeable.  Really sad as this is a 5star hotel with one star service,2,-0.6391
"There is nothing I could really fault, beautiful lobby, great bars, great service and lovely rooms. My only issue with hotels like the Shangri-La is the size, hard to get space at the pool for example, everything always felt a tad crowded. For the price, I would have preferred to stay at a boutique hotel where you would be in a more intimate scene.  Other than the size and traffic, there was nothing I would fault.",4,0.9738
"This is a ""substantial"", well-located, ""Luxury, resort hotel"" on a large, immaculately-manicured property!  All of the employees (providing all sorts of services) are very helpful and ""professionally trained""...  The swimming pool(s) are very large- and located in a ""garden setting"".  There is also, in a small, ""jungle-like setting"", a marvelous ""Koi Pond"" (with HUGE, multi coloured fish).  The many, variously themed restaurants and bars make one feel very much ""at home"".   The Hotel has also earned TripAdvisor's much esteemed ""Traveller's Choice"" designation (based on ""feedback"".provided by travelers like you and me).   A stay here will prove to be very memorable and worthwhile!  I hope that this Review has been helpful.",5,0.974
"My friend and I had a great experience at the rose veranda. I really enjoyed the food and tea. And i was impressed by the good service provided by staffs Allie, Julia and Ms. Lina.

"I love this hotel so much! I used to visit for both business and family holiday breaks, but I hadn't returned for some years when I decided to take a week's vacation there over New Year. Apart from a few minor changes, it's remained the same. It is still as impressive as my first visit. The staff are efficient, friendly and helpful. The rooms are spacious and come equipped with everything you could possibly need. Great products in the bathroom too. I went to two of the restaurants this time and they were both excellent. The grounds/pool are gorgeous. My only pet peeve is that guests go to the pool very early in the morning and put something on several chairs to claim them for later and then disappear for hours, leaving other guests without a place to sit. There is a sign saying",5,0.9897
"We were on family vacation to Singapore. It was first trip with the young brigade. Since we were 3 couples with 3 kids we were under doubt regarding the experience as it was our first trip abroad with them. The check In process was smooth and friendly. The biggest hurdle was food. Being pure vegetarian it was difficult to find many options for breakfast. Luckily Chef Dilip Nayak and his team made their best efforts to assist us. He particularly requested for our Indian food demands and made delicious Indian Masala Tea, Uttapam, Chole and all for all of us. The dinner preparation was very opt for us with delicious Dal Tadka, Panner and Bhindi Fry.   Over all this trip to Shangri La would not have been this great without Chef Dilip and his team. Thank you for this overwhelming",5,0.9701
"As a visitor to Shangri la Singapore for nearly one decade, I would like to say what difference it makes to be greeted year after year by the same members of staff. They make us feel more valued as loyal friends of the city and of the hotel and less as just a room number. For this reason, my husband and I would like to thank specifically: Bernard who every morning at the swimming pool takes the time to greet us and a lot of other people while checking everything is alright at the same time. With his long experience, he  is able to quickly notice and calm most disruptions around the pool. Raymond who is always working hard around the pool but still wave to the guests.  The older masseur who always welcomes back returning guests. in the valley wing, Dominique who is always",4,0.9271
"Our 5yo has declared that Shangri-La is “her” hotel- no wonder, as the staff really do make it a point to make her feel at home. This goes beyond the childrens’ amenities - such as a dedicated check in area and the fabulous play and Swimming areas. We, as parents, really appreciate that they take the time to talk to and engage with her.   So, all stars as a family friendly hotel. And for travellers without children, don’t worry- the layout and space ensures that the hotel remains tranquil and there is more than enough space for everyone. The rooms are also most definitely clean and spacious, and for families, do request for s room with a sofa bed made up for the children.   Although the hotel is not within walking distance to Orchard road, it does provide a complimentary",5,0.9768
"We had a wonderful stay at the family room (our 3rd stay in the last 12 month), celebrating our little one 4th birthday. The room reservation team did a fabulous job decorating the room with balloons, a birthday banner together with a delightful birthday cake. The little one was thrilled to see the decoration. Had a separate lunch celebration with the extended families at The Lobby and the F&amp;B team did a great job pulling it together despite having 2 birthday celebration parties on the same day.",4,0.9754

"This is a long overdue review but better late than never. I had very relaxing stay at Shangril- La Hotel and it is mostly due to the wonderful service of the Horizon Club . Since we were there for rest, we enjoyed the amenities of the Horizon Club and was there for high tea and cocktails most of the time. I personally liked the concept of having a separate Family Corner for families that bring their children to the lounge.  I would like to thank Viola, Gian and Ella for taking care of us during our stay. No request was too complicated for them and they always served us with a smile. Viola especially took note of the cheese I took a liking to and asked the kitchen if they had more in stock for me. These are little things that make a difference in making a stay memorable for a",5,0.9835
"We loved our stay, we recognize the Shangri-La brand as excellent and this stay lived up to that. The location towards Orchard road is very convenient and makes easy to get around Singapore. Our room was very nice and overlooked the amazing gardens and pool. The Housekeeping was excellent.  The Hotel has several restaurant options. We ate breakfast most days at the Line, which had everything you could wish for breakfast, and most importantly great coffee. We also took breakfast in the Italian restaurant by the pool one day and we were not disappointed, very good and more quite.   As we were at the Hotel for Christmas we booked in advance the Christmas dinner at the Line, second seating and it was just great. We did dine once in the lobby bar and is was quite good and we bought",5,0.9863
Lovely hotel and in a quiet area and close to orchard road and easy to get around singapore.  The room was lovely and overlooked the amazing gardens and pool.  Used the gym which was good and well equipped and lovely changing rooms.  This is a hotel of quality.  Room was lovely and had everything we needed.  Housekeeping was excellent.  Had drinks in the lobby and bought some food from the  bakery and pizza from the restaurant downstairs.It is a great hotel  if you just want to relax.  Staff were all so lovely could not fault this hotel at all. Will definitely return,5,0.993
"Slightly out of the way lies this well appointed hotel with numerous bars and restaurants. We booked an Horizon Club room which gives the benefits of complimentary breakfast, afternoon tea and drinks &amp; canapes every day.  The choice is excellent and service attentive.  The rooms might be ready for upgrading but spacious and comfortable.  Would definitely stay again.",5,0.9279
Stayed dec’19 with wife and 2 kids. Booked connecting rooms which was spacious and luxurious as expected from the brand. Hotel offers shuttle to orchard rd on the hr every hr up until 7pm. Best to be 15mins early in the queue. Prefer the tower block rather that garden wing. Location abit quiet as hotel is in residential area with not much to do around. Andreas at check is brilliant and an absolute assist to the company as is Syra from the Restuarant. What a pleasure meeting these 2 people. Taxi or shuttle required for any trips from hotel. Price can range from SGD 7 - 20 to furthest destination.,5,0.8689
"Visited the Shangri La Hotel, Singapore for two nights at the end of a weeks stay in the city. Acc  We have stayed here a couple of times before, although the last was in 2012, so we were looking forward to seeing how things had changed and I must say what a transformation in the reception, it now looks nothing like we knew.  LWe had originally booked a room in the Tower Wing with Club access, but after being told the rooms there had been refitted a few earlier, I changed our reservation to a larger room in the Valley Wing, and boy was I impressed.  The room was very large and sumptuous with a great view over pool and gardens as well as the city. We had all day access to the valley lounge where there was a full complimentary bar all day, high tea in the afternoon and guest",5,0.9497
"I visited the hotel with a good friend who frequently eats at this hotel, I like the hotel very much and the waterfall restaurant is my favourite. I drink Decaf coffee but it was impossible to get a hot cup of decaf coffee, we gave it a last shot last night at the lobby lunch but where unsuccessful in receiving a hot cup of decaf coffee, when you charge $ 16.50 for a dubble Expresso, you should be able to be served a hot coffee at a place that is otherwise almost perfect, Iwill be back March 14th and have an other go at it!!

"Stayed here for 5 nights over Xmas with a toddler and lots of family. Overall we had a great stay. Wonderful service from all the staff. Room requests were promptly attended to and the life guards at the pool do an amazing job watching over all the kids! Rooms are decently sized, clean and comfortable. No bidet in the toilet though. Shuttle service to orchard road was very punctual. Would’ve appreciated more frequent and later shuttle services though we still managed with taxis etc. The hotel did a great job decorating the hotel for Xmas and we (especially the toddler) loved all the Xmas ‘extras’ like Santa, the train ride in the garden and the chocolate snowman left in our room. Buds, the in house indoor playground is truly amazing. My toddler went almost everyday and is still",5,0.9895

"Family of four - 2 adults and 2 kids. The service from check in to check out was flawless. The team was kind enough to give us early check in at 10am.   Ms Ketki at the front desk was extremely helpful by arranging food / special requests for my kids who were unwell.  Their kids club is amazing! although it comes at an additional cost, its worth it.  The in room dining service and restaurants offer a great vareity and quality.   Location wise, its centrally placed and allows easy access to most tourist spots.  Highliy recommended for families.",4,0.9824
"I booked a one-night stay on the 27th December, given room 1810 and then 0628. My initial check-in experience was quite a let down. Firstly, I had requested during my reservations for an early check-in as we had booked the place for a birthday celebration.   However, on the day itself at 1pm, I was told that there wasn’t any ready room. Worse, I had explained about my tight schedule that afternoon and asked for a rough estimation so that I could have a headway but only to be told they do not know in return. Without an estimation of how long the wait would be, I was left helpless as to know what to do next and could not go about the rest of the day’s program. The whole process at the reception took me about half an hour, still without any room keys issued for me to put my luggage",4,-0.6486
"We booked the Valley Wing for this stay; it is the more ""exclusive"" shall we say part of the hotel. It has its own entrance and reception and make sure you ask your taxi driver to drop you there and not the main entrance as it is not easy to drive round to the Valley WIng from the main entrance. President Trump stayed here when he met Kim Jong-Il. I believe that this was the original Shangri-La hotel. You check in at the Valley Wing entrance. Your room key will only allow you access to your own floor in the lifts.   I had a suite with an enormous living room and bedroom and gigantic bathroom. Comfortable luxurious furniture and fittings. Definitely a feel of that 1980s plush fabrics decoration rather than the steel and glass more modern places, but I preferred this. Having said",5,0.5419
"Arrived at 2am and the front desk was very helpful making sure that we had everything we needed. The service was wonderful, food was excellent and the xmas decorations were wonderful. Great location as it was a easy walk to the shopping. Overall a very nice stay, you cannot go wrong with this property.",5,0.9825
First trip to Singapore and the hotel was excellent. Very family friendly. Rooms were immaculate. The pool area was a little crowded but lots of families with kids were having a great time. The staff was professional and very polite. It’s located just off the main road but it’s an easy walk to everything. We were here briefly on the way to Phuket. I wish we had reversed the itinerary and spent more time in Singapore. ,5,0.9561
"Hopefully this isn’t normal for the hotel as it is a holiday period, but I am one of the lucky guests that has a sun lounger. There simply aren’t enough to go around. The pool staff are inundated &amp; just simply say ‘we are full’. Tempers are fraying.  I think the manager should be made aware &amp; buy more!! It’s chaos here!!  On a positive, room lovely &amp; staff pleasant",4,0.9403
The concierge and front desk staff made the difference for us on this stay they were excellent. Johnny in particular was a true professional. We asked about last minute tickets the morning of Christmas Day to the Gardens by the Bay winter wonderland and other events. Johnny would not rest until he found us tickets for everything and even found discounted prices.  He did so with a genuine cheerfulness and a high degree of skill.  He really made a favorable impression.   We stayed as a family of five in two Garden Wing Deluxe rooms. One room had a king and the other had two queen beds. We added a rollaway bed as well which we found to be quite comfortable.    Here are some of the pros and cons. First the pros:  - The rooms in the Garden wing feel modern and clean.   - The bathroom,4,0.9719

"What began as confirming Tickets to the World’s Biggest Band.  To the Biggest Birthday Surprise till date  We Opted for Shangri-la Singapore for its location which was just a Hop, Skip &amp; Jump from Orchid Road  The Hotel was Expansive with many Oasis areas dotted around.  Check-in was seamless and was pleasantly surprised with an upgrade to The Valley Wing.  This maybe the old part of the hotel but what it lacked in décor made up with sheer service &amp; opulence.   The Upgrade came with the use of the Club Lounge and Summit Room Champagne Breakfast. Not to be missed,  the service was warm and genuine. Nothing was too much trouble. They catered to our every whim.  We only wished we could have stayed a little longer to enjoy the other facilities that this Hotel offered.",4,0.8716

"Stayed for two nights in November. The Shangri La is attractive, comfortable and does feel like an oasis of calm in the bust city centre.   If you want to be on Orchard Road, it’s close, but not quite on it. So you may wish to factor that in.   The lobby and pool were excellent. Room was comfortable, with a large bathroom. We stayed in the tower on the 12th floor and had good city views.   Breakfast was pretty chaotic. It was okay but I expected a nicer feel to a restaurant in the Shangrii La. It was a bit like a noisy canteen.   So, it was very nice, but for those reasons I’ll probably stay somewhere else when I go back to Singapore in the summer.",4,0.9888

"I was slightly disappointed on arrival to be informed that the room with balcony I had booked was unavailable due to maintenance. However, the reception manager offered my wife and I a free upgrade to 'a much quieter' wing of the hotel. We were so glad that she did!

I absolutely loved my stay here and the hotel has a good location right by Orchard Road for the shops.  A very nice welcome when we arrived and then taken to our rooms which were a wow  lovely view out to the pool and the most gorgeous bathroom lovely bath with a separate shower.  We stayed in the horizon wing which offered champagne and drinks and a private breakfast area.

"We chose to return to Shangri-La to celebrate my wife’s birthday with a two night staycation and, again, it did not disappoint.  We stayed in a Tower Wing 1BR for two nights which is spacious and comfortable, not to mention quiet. It comfortably slept the two of us with our 4 y/o on a foldout. An excellent option for a small family. The facilities at the hotel are second to none, particularly the kids club which has seemingly endless options for play with interactive, fun staff keen to ensure the kids are having a blast.  A big thanks to staff and management for making the birthday one for the books and a special mention to Nesh at the pool who was extremely friendly and attentive; it made our time at Shangri-La just that little bit more special.

Good TV channel selection and strong wifi , no need to mess around with access codes . A number of restaurants although i only used the same one for lunch and dinner on a few occasions called The Line on first floor. The food was very good and saved the International Buffet for my last night , if you are a big eater then i would recommend trying it .

This looks like a nice property but the staff is clearly trained and taught to openly RACIALLY DISCRIMINATE and then not own up to it but argue with their customers. I was booked for 4 nights but had an INSULTING incident the first night at the poolside, where their pool staff, this guy called NESH openly discriminated and when the incident was narrated to the hotel , they made another story saying the routine procedure was being followed. If it's routine procedure, the same treatment needs to be given to everyone sitting and ordering drinks, that clearly did not happen to two other guests sitting on my left or right and who happened to be of a different race. On the other hand, this guy NESH",1,0.6758
