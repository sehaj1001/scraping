"Last month, my wife and I, on a 30 day trip through SE Asia, had the pleasure of staying at the Pan Pacific Serviced Suites (Beach Road) in Singapore.  Singapore was our first stop on our odyssey.  My wife and I are frequent travelers and the one thing we know is that one of us (me) gets up much earlier than the other.  Especially after 24 +/- hours of traveling!  So, we were looking for an apartment-like arrangement when we found the Pan Pacific, in the very area we were hoping to stay.  Our room was perfect, with separate sleeping/living areas.  Plus, a kitchenette and washer/dryer.  The hotel is directly across Beach Road from the Arab Quarter, with all of its bars, restaurants and shops.  And an easy walk to a myriad of places to go and things to see.  Including Sun Tec City",5,0.9806
"Stayed here for 5 nights in January. We found the suites very spacious and well equipped. Service from staff was good and rooftop pool really nice with panoramic views.   Breakfast area is very small with limited options but was still adequate to get the day started.  Location: we found this to be be perfect for us. Walking distance to 2 MRT stops (5-10mins), theres a 7eleven right outside and the Hajji lane area is right across the street with plenty food options.   Overall, good value for money would definitely recommend!",5,0.974
"Really enjoyed the stay here.   It's definitely exceptional -- the room is what you would typically find at a Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons -- it's well laid out and has everything, including a rice cooker!   Front desk staff is superb.   Had a problem with an early cancellation and they handled expertly.   Free breakfast buffet in the a.m. is outstanding.  It's a great choice for Singapore!",5,0.9954
"We stayed before this and we loved it since day one! Great room, good deal and amazing breakfast too!! So we decided to come back for our anniversary staycation! This is by far the best stay I've ever had! ",5,0.9128
"Its hard to write a review when everything about a hotel is exceptional!   We stayed here for 11 nights in March 2020 and loved every minute. The location, staff, service, facilities and apartments are all incredible. The apartment is very high spec with everything you need for a long term stay, more storage space than I knew what to do with it and I think I counted 17 plug sockets.   I disagree with any negative comments on here about breakfast, we always found a table and there was a great range of food with this changed on a daily basis. The highlight for us being french toast.  We can't wait to return :)   ",5,0.9371
"We stayed at the Pan Pacific, Serviced Apartments for 3 nights in February 2020. We had an unfortunate start as our taxi driver dropped us off at the wrong location. Walking to these apartments along Beach Road, we could not see the front entrance, as it's almost like a service road or entrance to a multi-storey car park. The building is, however, clear from the road.  Once inside, the reception was very pleasant and much more glamorous than the approach. The staff were all very friendly, helpful and so on. Screening checks were done in view of the COVID-19 issue and awareness of this situation was heightened.   We subsequently realised that you can get in via Park Royal next door. There is a link between the two, that you can use, once you have your room card. There are plenty",5,0.9488
"Very convenient location. Friendly service. Apartment was spacious and well equipped. Complimentary breakfast and unlimited teas and coffee from their library. Rooftop pool and gym, with fantastic views. One grumble about  the pool - very shallow throughout. I found it very difficult to swim.  I needed late check out as my flight was not till midnight. Would have been great if they did half day rates.",4,0.8316
"Excellent room, nice pool, helpful staff. The only downside is the small breakfast room. I would be very happy to stay again since it's withing walking distance to most sights. There are a couple of handy supermarkets just downstairs.",4,0.7567
"We were well looked after by the staff, particularly Jimmy and Taka at reception. The all round service was excellent and the buffet breakfast set us up for the day; in fact a little too well as I tended to eat a tad too much the first two days! Our room was clean and well appointed with en-suite shower room, air conditioning was essential and worked well.",4,0.7486
"The building is well positions if you like to be in an outgoing area, yet avoid the busy feeling of Orchard Road. The flats are well designed, feel fairly new, are modern with all amenities. They are maintained very well and always feel clean and hygenic. The price-quality is definitely very good and qualifies for a longer-term stay for expats. We had the sea view, which time and time again is stunning.",5,0.9638
Awesome place to stay. I would definitely recommend this. Friendly staff. Great breakfast. Great pool with nice views. Rooms really clean and staff really helpful. I stayed with young kids who also thoroughly enjoyed their stay. ,5,0.9834
"I stayed at 15th floor executive suite. It is spacious and functional with all I need. The cleanness is good.  I am not picky on breakfast, the selection may disappoint some.   The gym and pool are perfect and they are very essential for my business travels. Plus points!  Convenience store is downstairs. I will come back definitely next time, as I have always been staying on Bencoolen all the time.",5,0.9757
"Though the location might not be right on the buzzling area like Orchard but this property has lift up to Pan Pacific standards! The staff were super friendly. The room was so big, clean and well equipped! Breakfast line was acceptional. We will definitely stay at this place in our next visit!!  ",5,0.5023
"We spent a week here as a base for our visit to Singapore and didn't regret it for a second. Conveniently located across the street from the Duo Towers we found that these had direct access to the MRT system, so once we had this figured out getting around was a breeze. The reception staff were always approachable and welcomed you ‚Äòhome' with a smile every time you walked through the door. The size of the breakfast room has been mentioned many times, but we found timing is everything here. My one complaint would be that the roof top pool was so cold - even though the outside temperature was in excess of 30 degrees. As a result we didn't bother spending much time up there.  We would definitely stay here again if we visit Singapore in the future ",5,0.886
"We have just enjoyed a wonderful stay at Pan Pacific Serviced Suites Beach Road. We arrived on Friday night and could see the buzz of Haji Lane from our window. Our suite was spacious and very well appointed with every thing you need including full sized fridge, washing machine and comfortable lounge area. The roof top infinity pool was delightful had had a view of the Singapore Flyer. They cleaned our room everyday and provided substantial breakfast 6 days per week (and the most luscious, flaky  croissants from their kitchen). The location is brilliant being a short walk to either Nicholl Highway (yellow line) or Bugis (blue &amp; green line) stations. The only odd thing is the entry. Our taxi driver couldn't find it - you have to drive passed the Park Royal and take the next",5,0.9824
"We stayed here for 3 nights. When we checked in we were upgraded to a Premier Suite. It was immaculate!! The views were amazing!! The staff were all so friendly and helpful. Breakfast was really good also and the times were excellent, 6am to 11am. I would highly recommend this place and it has the most comfortable bed we have ever slept in!!",5,0.986
"When I looked for an hotel in Singapore, I looked for a property who can accommodate my needs without getting bankrupt. The pan pacific serviced suites Beach road was great for that purpose. First, while arriving before check in time, we got a room (plus an upgrade) Secondly, the room is well equipped with everything one need while traveling: a washing and drying machine, espresso machine and a fully stocked kitchen. Not to mention the great views and the great pool. I would definitely recommend staying in this hotel.",5,0.9466
Only have positive things to say. Great service. Clean spacious rooms. The cleaner set my daughters toys daily. Bfast was great!views from the room And pool are spectacular. Would definitely stay here again. Close to marina bay . Suntec city is opposite. Park Royal ws next to us and they had a great hairdresser. Hotel allowed us to check out late as well so that for me is a bonus ,5,0.9863
"almost is said in the subject - hotel is near the perfect place to go out dining where one will find lots of choices. we came for the F1 and it was less 15 minutes walking distance from one main entrance. rooms are large and beds are comfy. rooftop pool really impressive and beautiful with nice view (but it would not hurt if it would be heated). staff overall really smiling and helpful (perfect Front Desk) , good Housekeeping. I would have noted the place a full 5 if the breakfast would be better... if the food is good overall, the place is small and is easily crowded, feels unconfortable. coffee and hot drinks at a machine, no hot chocolate. Overall a very good quality price ratio.",5,0.9791
"We had a fantastic room with a great view overlooking a park and part of the harbour. The location was excellent, a short walk to the Bugis MRT station and within a kilometre of Raffles Hotel and the Formula 1 circuit. You can see (and hear) a section of the Formula 1 track from the top floor swimming pool. Also over Beach Road is Haji Lane which is full of restaurants and bars which had live music on Saturday night. The room was immaculately clean and the bed was one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. All the staff were very friendly and professional. My wife and I would choose to stay the next time we are in Singapore.",5,0.9769
"A really nice 5 day stay with the whole family ranging in ages 9 through to 65, where all the staff are real friendly, &amp; accommodating &amp; the  facilities were above average. Plus within walking distance of many attractions, ",5,0.9323
"This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel. We booked a 3 room suite which was amazingly neat, clean and well-maintained. The hotel staff are very friendly, the view of the rooms overlooks Singapore Flyer with beautiful lights at night, adding to the romantic atmosphere at night. The atmosphere at the roof top pool is also very beautiful. The location is very close to Masjid Sultan and Bugis junction. There are many restaurants around the hotel. It is highly recommended to stay in this hotel when visiting Singapore.",5,0.9946
For value and excellent customer care you won't go wrong at this hotel Close to met station so easy to access all of Singapore's attractions  Over the road from the famous haji lane and all its diners and bars The hotel pool is an infinity pool which overlooks marina bay and the Singapore flyer. The room was spacious with a kitchen and living area  The hotel staff could not do enough for us,5,0.9381
We loved our stay here. The complimentary breakfast was excellent and the staff was great. The pool and gym had a gorgeous view and they were the best amenities of the hotel. The pool was great to swim in after a long day of exploring. I definitely recommend this hotel if you are seeking a relaxing and enjoyable stay.,5,0.9952
"A fantastic hotel in an excellent location in Singapore. Across the road from Haji lane and Bugis. The rooms were very modern and spacious. The only thing was the fridge wasn't that clean upon arrival but we didn't use it. The breakfast was lovely and very tasty a small selection but it changes everyday. However, it can get very busy and you may have to wait 1-2 mins for a table to become available. All staff were extremely welcoming.",4,0.6789
We stayed in the 1 bedroom suite.  Very comfortable clean accommodation.  Breakfast was fine.  Staff very helpful.  Would recommend.  Walking distance to most things we wanted to see but used taxis also which were quite cheap.,5,0.9785
Next time I visit Singapore Pan Pacific Suites will be my choice to stay.  All staff are very helpful special mention to Angeline on check in she gave myself and wife an upgrade because it was her birthday and have to mention the beautiful birth cake they bought to the room.  Excellent breakfast with a different varieties each morning.  Great views from room and the pool on the 21st floor is a great way to past time if you have a late flight back home.  Train and bus stops are very close so getting around is no problem at all.  Only 20 dollars for the taxi from the airport more convenient than the train or bus. . Has to be the quites place I have ever stayed in.  Singapore will always be my choice for a stop over now and Pan Pacific will be my choice f accommodation üòÄ,5,0.9245
"Im in Singapore for business quite often and this is the first time I stayed at the Pan Pacific in Beach Road. I have to say it's now my favorite place to stay in Singapore. Hotel staff from room service to housekeeping are extremely warm and accommodating, rooms are spacious and wonderfully-designed, and best of all, the pillows and sheets are heavenly fluffy-cloud soft. I loved the pillows and sheets so much that I inquired with Pan Pacific if they were available for sale. :) Breakfast can be a bit crowded so try to come early and make sure to grab a couple of croissants (or many) as they are incredibly buttery and just plain delightful. Pan Pacific will definitely be my go-to place in Singapore. Love everything about it. Lots of great restaurants nearby and in-room dining by",5,0.9907
"Pan Pacific Serviced Suites is the best facility in terms of location, services and price. The staff is very friendly and professional. Eddy and Sarah are best among their staff members. The facility provides breakfast - which is extra as none of serviced apartments provides breakfast.",5,0.9838
"The standard room size is 45m2, it is subdivided into living, dinning, kitchen, bedroom and toilets. Everywhere feels small. Room and furniture are too old and should be due for renovations . Lousy main entry. Small Hotel lobby.",3,0.4431
"We spent 8 days in Singapore and stayed at Pan Pacific Serviced Suites on Beach Road for our entire stay. The apartment was immaculately clean, super comfy and very well appointed, plus it had the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on (including my own!) The location was fabulous with two MRT stations super close by meaning we could travel all over the city with absolute ease. Would not hesitate to stay here again on our next trip to Singapore. Just one small suggestion for improvement would be to have a larger area for breakfast to accommodate guests more comfortably (or alternatively just don't offer breakfast).",5,0.9642
"We stayed here for 10 nights and this is probably one of the nicest hotels we have ever stayed at. The apartment was modern, spacious with high ceilings, plenty of storage cupboards and more power points than you could ever wish for, I counted 24 that I could see! Bottled water, room service and breakfast was provided daily apart from Sunday which we didn't find an issue as we enjoyed a sleep in without being disturbed.  The breakfasts were very well organized so that when we were allocated a table we didn't have to worry about someone else sitting at it while we were getting our breakfast. The choice of food and presentation for breakfast was good both hot and cold being on offer.  The location of the hotel really is excellent as it's just a couple of minutes walk to numerous",5,0.9294
"The location was good and close to the train (MRT) and also close to Arab Street where there are some bars and night music. The apartment was quiet, spacious and had a great view over the Singapore Flyer and bay. The beds were comfortable and the apartment had a kitchen and the washing machine which was great. The infinity pool area upstairs looked out over the bay with a great view and the gym and pool area were kept spotless by the attendant who was always on hand. The breakfast was just right. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and nothing was a problem. We really enjoyed our stay at the Pan Pacific Suites and would certainly stay there again. Thank you.",5,0.9303
"The hotel personnel were accommodating, warm and helpful, specifically the personnel in the concierge named Patricia. The rooms and facilities were also clean. The amenities were complete. I recommend the place to other visitors.",5,0.9538
"This is one of the best apartments that I ever stayed in.  A fully equipped kitchen (including washing machine), separate lounge, separate bedroom with a very comfortable bed.  There were lots of conveniently located power sockets to plug all our devices into.  The apartment was spotlessly clean.  The infinity swimming pool on the top of the building was delightful and we had a swim every day. A delicious breakfast downstairs was included A great location, with Bugis MRT station only 300m away, and Bugis shopping mall with a supermarket only 400m away. We really enjoyed our stay here and would love to stay here again should be visit Singapore again.",5,0.765
"We enjoyed our stay in the Pan Pacific Suites on Beach Road.  The location worked well for us due to its easy access to the airport, the wonderful bonus of the Positano Risto just across the road, and nearness to Gardens by the Bay, one of our main goals.  The suite itself was fine and the breakfast on Saturday was very nice.  There are just a few things that made this less than 5 stars, though.  Part of the reason that I had booked was for the washer and dryer, as this was at the end of our trip and it's nice to go home with clean clothing.  However, the dryer just really doesn't work.  We had to hang the clothes, and some of them were still damp for packing two days later.  Another odd thing is the extremely noisy drains:  just a few drops of water down the drain sounds like a",4,0.9657
"I just moved to Singapore and staying here as a temp housing for 2 months. First of all, this hotel has nice facilities- good spacious library, nice gym and beautiful swimming pool with stunning view. Also they give you free breakfast which is not bad. Housekeeping is also very good, kind &amp; clean. However if you are looking for a place for longterm stay like me, would recommend checking below points before you decide: - service is not consistent, seems like staffs need more training. For eg, this place provides free shuttle service according to its website. But some staffs know it, while some staffs don't know it. Also you have to book it in advance. But even if you book it in advance, you need to remind them again. Because the person who received booking didn't deliver the",3,0.2579
"Stayed here for four nights while in Singapore on business and absolutely loved it! Beautiful, spacious rooms with fully equipped kitchen and a fantastic gym and pool. I liked the location as it is very close to Bugis Junction for shopping and transport. Would definitely stay again! ",5,0.9757
";Area and Surroundings: The hotel is very well and well located. It's just opposite a very popular place called Haji Laneù, a 15 min walk from Bugis Streetù. People looking for good open-air bars and restaurant can enjoy drinks and tapas at ‚ÄúHaji Lane‚Äù just next to the hotel.  The hotel reception was very inviting and they were quick to check us in. They also accommodated us for early check-in at 11:00 AM.   -&gt;Room: We opted for a Premium One-Bedroom Apartment with City View. The room was very well laid out with all things placed to comfort. The view from bedroom and living room was just stunning. The bedroom specially had two walls made from glass from floor to ceiling and that gave such a spectacular view and of course the feel to the room. The living room had a sofa cum",5,0.9913

"The hotel apartment was amazing, and our booking includes breakfast, although the breakfast restaurant is kinda small. We got upgraded from deluxe to premium room 1213, by the nice gentleman (I forgot his name, sorry). The suite is in the corner, so the bedroom has two sides view to marina, it was really nice.  It equipped with complete kitchen utensils, huge fridge, a washing machine (detergent was provided), a rice cooker, and an oven (yes, the real one, not a microwave oven). The pool and gym located at 21st floor with view over the marina. There's a 7-11 store and a small convenient store in the vicinity. Bugis MRT station, Kampong Glam, Duo is just across the street. Bugis Junction is just 10 minutes walk. Will definitely consider to comeback.",5,0.9657
Enjoyed our stay in this hotel and we never left the property throughout the 2 days of our stay. Simply enjoying the facility and chill in the room. The only we were sad is that on sunday there will be no breakfast provided. So we have to go out to find for food. ,5,0.9665
"Stayed in a suite for 3 nights in the Pan Pacific for our 3 night stop over in Singapore. We were originally booked into the Andaz just over the road but we had to change dates due to a rescheduled flight onto Thailand.   When we arrived we were not disappointed at all. The corner suite was very spacious, modern and clean with views across the Kampong Glam district.     We had a very relaxing stay here whilst enjoying the sites Singapore has to offer. The Hotel is situated just across the road from many bars and restaurants which cater for every taste. We particularly liked the "" Piedra Negra "" bar.  We have would have no hesitation in staying here again. The staff and facilities are excellent. There is a small convienence store just outside the building and a five minute walk",4,0.9722
"Spent two nights in this beautiful location. Suite was spacious and well decorated, with high tech devices available and plenty of space. You will not miss anything during your stay. Staff is attentive, cordial and pleasant to deal with. The only down side was a heavy smoke smell which did not go away, perhaps only our suite was affected from the previous guest, however other than that the stay was immaculate.",5,0.993
"Stayed here with my fianc√© for 4 days and 3 nights. Absolutely best rest and experience for my time in Singapore.  The staff is very welcoming for both check-in and checkout. The room was absolutely amazing. So spacious, comforting with high ceiling and windows. A kitchen, washer and dryer are also included. We had a spectacular view of Haji Lane.  Spent some time at the gym which gave a great view of the Singapore Flyer and surrounding buildings. The pool was also quite nice during down time to enjoy the view and weather during the am or late at night.  This hotel is in a great location for nearby restaurants that are open extremely early or late. I would say how this hotel could improve is in their breakfast options. It would be nice to take out less of the American Breakfast",5,0.9705
"I stayed here for almost four weeks with my wife and daughter. I was on an extended business trip so they came along as well. The room was a good size with a washer dryer, two TV's and very comfortable king sized bed. The breakfast is outstanding and the menu changes. If you have a preference, ask and they will accommodate if possible. My daughter takes soymilk and the kitchen staff ensured it was there every morning.   It's also very convenient to the Bugis area and lots of shopping and sightseeing. I will stay there again the next time I'm in Singapore.",5,0.891

There was a small issue which Ms Hidayu sorted out in a efficient, professional and courteous manner - from check-in till the day we checked- out, we thoroughly enjoyed  our stay and made this a special Anniversary a memorable stay in Singapore.  What can we say: fabulous room. spacious, well equipped, clean and with amazing views of water, gardens by the bay plus a bottle of wine and some snacks as a surprise when we entered the room.

"My fiance and I stayed at Pan Pacific on Beach Road for 3 nights on our recent trip to Singapore. We got the MRT from a large and ""very famous"" hotel not too far away, and would consider Pan Pacific overall much better! Note is is a little tricky to find the entrance... from Beach Road, we could see the hotel, but didn't see any signs. You have to walk down a car park entrance with boom gates (there is a walking path which is good).  The reception area is lovely, and staff were extremely helpful - special mention to Doris! We were able to check in with ease, and head up to our apartment on the 9th floor - great views out of the floor to ceiling windows.

"Decided to stop over in Singapore whilst returning from NZ. This hotel was 20 mins from airport by cab and well situated for two MRT lines or for walking around the city. We walked about 12k a day but for speed or longer journey's such as the Botanic Gardens, we used the MRT.  The appartment had all you could need: huge comfy bed, nice fierce shower, kitchen with microwave, fridge, stuff, and washing machine and tumble dryer which was the only thing we did use after the inevitable tropical downpour each day.  There is an infinity pool on the roof with great views over the harbour and, frankly, I could have spent a day there watching the shipping movements.

Due to our flight times we arrived early and left late and we were able to leave our luggage at reception and were offered the use of the lounge, where complimentary hot drinks and biscuits were available.",5,0.9508
"I booked the Pan Pacific Serviced Suites with high expectations as the rooms looked large and modern and the price was relatively good. I travel for business to Singapore often and still have not found a good value for money accommodation as the good hotels are usually very high priced, so I was really looking forward to trying out this residence.  When we arrived I noticed that the wooden panels on the corridor walls were coming apart, probably due to the humidity the glue was failing. Although the design was modern and minimal this effect made it look cheap and older.  The room was quite nice and spacious, but eventually I realised that the standard of cleanliness was very, very low for an allegedly ""5 star"" accommodation.  I cleaned the yellow stains from the toilet seat in",2,-0.2848
"I stayed 4 nights at Pan Pacific Serviced Suites Beach Road and I really enjoyed my stay. Normally I stay at hotels in Orchard Road or Clarke Quay so perhaps I missed a bit to be in a more crowded area.   Nonethess, it is very close to Haji Lane, Bugis Junction, Suntec, between 6-8 min from the nearest MRT station so I think it is a good option to stay. The staff was also very helpful.",5,0.9501
"We visit Singapore often but this is the first time we tried this hotel. The best thing is their service. The staff were really friendly, accommodating and helpful.  We got a unit at the 19th floor and the view is great! The living and kitchen area were very modern with all the necessary kitchen equipment (nespresso machine, stove, etc).  The bedroom and bathroom were really spacious too.  Breakfast was a bit crowded but selection is good. It is walking distance to the subway and 7/11 is just located in front of the apartment.  I will stay in this hotel again during my next visit.",5,0.9727
"Clean, spacious room.   REALLY REALLY comfortable bed.   Kitchenette with everything you need.    Washing machine in room.   Really good breakfast.  Affinity pool on the roof.  Helpful and welcoming staff.  1/2 the cost of Marina Bay Sands.  Close to the Big Bus Tour booth.   ",5,0.9629
"I've been to Singapore 4 times before and stayed at other hotels, but I think I've found a Gem!!  The accommodation is large and extremely well equipped and although we only stay 4 days, you could easily stay for a lot longer.(Home from Home) Large lounge with Tv, DVD player and surround sound. Comfortable couch to sit on, large full length windows to enjoy the view. A kitchen area fully equipped and even a washing machine/dryer. There are also solutions for washing the dishes, and powder for the washing machine. Table and chairs to eat at.  Lovely bedroom and a really comfortable bed and Pillows with another tv and docking for your iPhone., And lots of storage cupboards.  The Bathroom was kept very clean when service. Just a walk in shower, No bath.  The swimming Pool and Gym",5,0.8234
"Loved this place... we have stayed at marina bay sands... and this was sooooo much better, quieter, best gym and swimming pool with great views.  A lot less people, very friendly staff and close walk to interesting shopping lanes, great value food outlets and Knick knacks... only negative is the room smelled of cigarette smoke.... THIS PLACE IS GREAT VALUE....",5,0.8559
"Premium Suite  ROOM 9/10 It's definitely deserving of being called a serviced suite, with all the amenities needed for a long term stay. A pity that the bedroom doesn't have a separate air-con duct, which means I have to leave the door open at night when I sleep or suffer the resultant stuffiness.  FACILITIES 9/10 Pool has adequate size and depth, not to mention a gorgeous view! The gym provides a good mix of cardio and strength-training tools, and has a light pleasant scent permeating it. The living room at level 2 is excellent for chilling out; they provide free coffee and tea too!  On a related note, I booked my staycation for Sat to Sun, and was so sad that they didn't serve breakfast on Suns üò≠  SERVICE¬†10/10 Staff were attentive, friendly, and obliging to my needs.

"It was our second year in a row having stayed at PPSS and we still thoroughly enjoyed out time there. The location is fantastic; the front desk staff are friendly and helpful, and the rooms are very comfortable. However, having stayed at PPSS the previous year, we were able to make some observations about changes in level of service and what may unfortunately indicate cost cutting. ‚Ä¢	The pool area is looking a bit tired ‚Äì there is noticeable repair work required to fix broken and warped timber on the pool surrounds and decking. ‚Ä¢	There are never enough towels for use at the pool. ‚Ä¢	On our previous visit, upon being seated for breakfast options were provided for cooked breakfasts (eg. Omelettes, pancakes) and pots of tea or coffee were provided.  On this visit, no such offer was",4,0.9259
"I have spent 10 days in this hotel for a work trip.  The atmosphere is different from a ""normal"" hotel.  The room is big and spaces are well organized.  Breakfast in the morning is not at the same level of other 5 stars hotels in Singapore.   Clean as you good expect.  On Sundays they don't provide service for breakfast and they don't clean the room.  I have been told at the arrival.  ",3,0.6555
Reasonable size apartment which was well equipped and clean. Staff very helpful. It is in a good location with MRT stations close by. Many coffee shops and eating places in the vicinity including the small but interesting Arab quarter on the other side of Beach Road.,4,0.8519
"Stayed here for a week with my husband. The location is actually great. You can cross the road to Haji Lane and Arab Street area. It's very near to Bugis. Just a 10-15 minutes walk to the mrt. There are two nearby mrt which is Nicoll Highway (closer) and Bugis. The room is very nice, they upgraded our room which we really appreciate. The view from our room is very nice. The size is decent, not too big not to small. But the bathroom is quite small. They have full size fridge, washing machine, oven, toaster and the tools as well. I'm surprised that they provide lots of tools, even the kitchen towel, sponge and soap for the dish and washing machine. They also provide bathroom amenities too. One thing that they can upgrade more is the cleanliness, I don't think they clean the rooms",5,0.7543
"The rooms are very comfortable (fabulous bed to rest after a long hot day on the town!), super spacious and nicely decorated. The pool, located on the 21st floor, has privileged views of the coast, Gardens by the Bay and the Singapore Flyer, and is a delight to enjoy the sunset. Location is perhaps the hotel's greatest asset: walking distance to many of the city's main attractions, and very close to both public bus and metro stations.   Some downsides: Even though the rate we purchased included breakfast, the hotel does not serve breakfasts on Sundays (which is something they do not disclose until the guests have arrived and have no other choice but to accept this). This not only entails incurring extra expenses (for a hotel that is already pricey), but also wasting time looking",4,0.9757
"Our Executive suite had the perfect view of Singapore that we hoped for, with floor to ceiling windows looking towards the Singapore Flyer and the bay. The local area was very interesting and had many options for places to eat. The nearby Suntec shopping center was within walking distance and offered a great range of mid-range stores including Cotton-On and H &amp; M as well as great hawker style food court. Having the kitchen in the apartment style suite meant we could snack on our own food items as well. Staff at reception and room attendants were all friendly and very helpful. My only suggestion for improvement would be in regards the breakfast. The fact there is no breakfast on Sundays or public holidays meant we missed out on two breakfast days during our stay, yet the price of",4,0.9735
Nice 1 bdrm suite with views of Gardens by the Bays and the Singapore Flyer. Clean and good kitchen and bathroom facilities. Nice pool complex on the top floor.

Breakfast provided although not on Sundays or public holidays.,4,0.7918
"If you're looking for space, then the pan pacific suites is for you. We booked a one bedroom apartment for 2 adults and 1 baby. It was spacious compared to your typical hotel rooms. We made good use of the kitchen and dining table, the kitchen was great to prep and clean baby bottles, and with a little one it was sometimes easier to eat in so the dining table was super handy. And of course, we were eating in with air con, most of the time, we either got take away or got food delivered. The heat outside was at times hard to fathom especially with a 1 year old. Also having a washing machine was great, especially after a day out sweating your bum off, it was great to be able to wash and wear fresh clothes again.   The hotel location is good if you are happy to take taxis",5,0.7096
"We took the opportunity to visit Singapore in October 2018, due some amazing deals with QANTAS.  We booked the 1 Bedroom Premium apartment and arranged a Limo pick up.  Or experience was one of the best, the customer service, the breakfast, the location were all excellent.  The view from the room and the pool level were breath taking.  This one the first O/S trip without the kids and Pan Pacific suited our needs perfectly.",5,0.9571
You can do a lot better than this bland corporate monstrosity. It's uninspired to the max and there's only one service desk. There is no breakfast on Sunday because they're cheap on overtime pay. They don't like to give late checkouts even when the place is empty. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere more deserving of your money. ,3,0.4118
"This is an all-apartment hotel where rooms includes standard appliances such was washing machine/dryer, full size fridge, bench top, oven, microwave. The bedroom is separate from the open plan lounge and dinning area with the full kitchen in a separate area yet again. The bathroom includes full sized bathtub and spacious shower. The bed was super comfortable comparable with the best bedding from the big 5-star chains. There is a great infinity pool with views to Gardens by the Bay on the 21st floor and the gym provides 24-hr access. The service from its staff from front counter, breakfast service, and room maintenance were all excellent and can't be faulted.

"The standout feature of this property is the large rooftop pool with a fabulous view.  It is long enough to swim laps in and what a place to do so!  The property is conveniently located near two MRT stations - Nicolls Highway is 5 mins walk away, Bugis Junction 15 mins (where there are also lots of shops and a supermarket).  It is directly opposite the Arab Quarter with lots of different restaurants and bars.  It is easy to get most places in Singapore using the MRT.  The one bedroom suite was modern and ours also had a terrific view through floor to ceiling windows.  There were a number of issues with its set-up though, annoying if you want to make use of the kitchen/laundry.

Also Chef Lisa who cooked great Aglio Olio pasta during breakfast hours. Specially mention and applaud Victoria who's very friendly, attentive to details and ensure everything was well take care of. She's certainly an asset to the Organisation.

There's a washing machine, coffee maker, fridge and cooking equipment so it's very well suitable for business/longer stays too. Bugis MRT was only a short walk away so the location is also convenient.  The arab street area has lots of trendy restaurants, craft beer and shops.

Stayed at this no frills service suite with daily housekeeping for 5 days. Front desk is friendly. Not a large development and location is good with less than 10 minutes walking to Bugis Junction and Suntec City.

Pan Pacific Serviced Suites was absolutely perfect. We got a 1BR suite that was spacious and functional. The breakfast spread was alright given the price point.  The hotel is also ideally located within walking distance of the Bugis MRT, and the Bugis Junction.   Can't wait to go back!",5,0.9604

He help me book a taxi but the taxi arrived shortly (within 1 minute). When I asked him again he said I needed to wait. The taxi waited in the drive way for more than 15 minutes.

Never had a bad hotel in nine visits to Singapore and the Pan Pacific Serviced Suites were up with the best. Handy to everything and staff always willing to help. Were warned the breakfast service could be a bit chaotic but didn't find that to be the case. Never waited more than a minute or two and food was certainly of an acceptable standard. Having breakfast and Wifi included a bonus.,4,0.9623
"Hotel is located right behind popular Arab Street and Haji Lane. Not the biggest buffet breakfast. People were often waiting to be seated as the dining area is small and because of this, several people, including us were asked if we finished our breakfast so other people would be seated. We felt rushed - perhaps they should consider making the dining area bigger not kicking out paying customers. Also, they don't serve breakfast on Sundays or public holidays. The rooms are modern however there was a stale smell in our room. Lastly, there are no proper mirrors in the room except one in the bathroom - all others mirrors are tinted and aren't practical.",3,-0.9091

Lots and lots of space for your clothing. Drinking water provided every day to your room or is available in the gym.

"To be honest we have struggled finding Services Apartments.  Well search no more, the search is complete.  The Pan Pacific Serviced Suites were a pure delight.  The day starts with delightful views from the room before heading to the pool for a few laps.  The modest buffet breakfast is enough the start the day of adventures.  The staff are polite, the rooms are extremely well presented. The surrounding areas on Beach Rd are a delight to tease the taste buds, Noodle Thai Thai Kitchen is the best, but so many options are available.

Great pool and gym on the roof top. Rooms are average size and furniture is pretty low quality. Plastic chairs and the couch was very tired. Seat cushions kept slipping forward making it impossible to sit on comfortably. Breakfast was a feeding frenzy. Far too small a restaurant and buffet for size of hotel.

The stay was almost perfect!! Thank you for the nice staffs and the management of this hotel. But one thing that can be improved is  breakfast provided on Sunday morning. My wife and I were shocked that the staff told us about there's no breakfast provided in every serviced suites in Singapore when we arrived the breakfast hall with intent to eat breakfast on that Sunday morning. I don't know the reason behind. But it seems unfair to the customers who pay and stay there on Saturday night.,5,0.9414
"Stayed at pan pacific serviced suite beach road for 6 nights. The hotel might has a small lobby but the room is definitely not small and well equiped.we have our own living room with sofa, dining table, small kitchen with washing/drying machine, coffee maker and refrigerator/ freezer. The swimming pool is not huge or grand but has a amazing view. The breadfast has moderate selections but foods are ok. The issue that we have is we are travelled with family of 2 adults and 2 kids aged 5 and 3. The hotel only allowed only 1 kid below 12yrs old staying free of charge. They will charge a surcharge for the extra kid. However, thanks to help of receptionist Sarah, this issue is settled accordingly. Big thank to Sarah for being extremely helpful and considerate. I will recommend this",4,0.9944
Very comfortable rooms with the luxury of home.  Very friendly service minded personnel.  Just a few minor points: in the morning very busy in the breakfast room due to limited space.

We've just stayed in Singapore for 5 nights and had decided to go with the option of a serviced apartment. Which gives us the chance  of eating in. There is a great supermarket in nearby in Suntec City 7 mins walk from the hotel. The suite also included a washing machine which is an added bonus. and the breakfast in the mornings was fantastic as it varied each day.

"Stayed here for 7 days and it was absolutely perfect.  We booked a premium room which I believe guarantees a higher floor and views out towards the flyer which I would recommend. There was nothing better than sitting looking at the view at the end of a long day with a glass of wine.  The facilities within the room were superb, great seating area and kitchenette, loads of space.  The location was great, 10 minute walk to Bugis MRT station which was a  link to most areas that you would want to go to.  We only had breakfast here a couple of times, however found it to be perfectly adequate.  The staff were helpful, although we never needed much assistance form the.  The only minor issue I would say is the charge for a late checkout.  As previously mentioned it was around $190",5,0.9806

One option was to send people to the 2nd floor to eat but there are no tablles or cutlery set up and they expect you to go back and forth down",3,0.8912
