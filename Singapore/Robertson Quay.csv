Right on the quay and restaurant area. Very nice motel clean and tidy. Rooms a little bit small but sufficient for us. Has pool for that late arvo swim after being out all day. Would stay again but have breakfast out as heaps of eating areas nearby .,4,0.4639
"I have booked and paid in full this hotel for myself and extended family 2 rooms in May before our cruise holiday. Due to the corona virus, government restrictions and do not travel notifications there is no way we can use our rooms. This hotel would not consider a refund, voucher or any amendments to the booking ..very heartless as lots more hotels in Singapore are refunding even ‘non-refundable ‘ bookings. And it seems like they’re doing to lots of people. Disgraceful Myself and my family will never use this hotel again. Beware!",1,-0.126
"After looking fwd to my stay that was booked and paid in full as nobody had foreseen the corona virus l rang the Robertson Quay Hotel to ask for a refund due to Singapore restrictions on entry for traveller coming via Asean nations. We are in Malaysia and previously been in Thailand. So the reservation lady said sorry we will not refund your 4 nights paid. She said you can enter Singapore and use your booking, l told her that was not possible. She said yes it was. I rang another hotel The Marriott Singapore and asked can l book 4 night. They sorry sir that's only possible if you have 14 nights booked in a room quarantined. I told The Robertson Quay Hotel reservations lady this. She said you can still come. No refund will be made.

"Ok for a budget hotel and very close to the restaurants and river . Didnt have the breakfast so cant comment, nice pool area and quiet location. Room was a bit cosy and not much storage. Although its not somewhere I would  stay again, the staff were extremly helpful and polite.",3,0.3409
"I had been put up at this hotel for 2 weeks and it was nothing short of awful.  Its a simple budget hotel with absolutely no concern for customer service. No one at reception will help with bags so you struggle with heavy luggage up the small ramp or steps yourself.  The rooms are cramped but the beds pretty comfortable. The bathroom feels like an airplane toilet. They dont even give hand towels or hand soap. You have to use the shower gel for your hands too!  The worst aspects however is the quality of internet...its awful. The wifi connects in only certain parts of the room so good luck trying to watch a movie while lazing in bed.  The aircon is always blasting at freezing temperatures, could not sleep 1 night peacefully despite keeping it off.  The breakfast is the same thing",2,0.8846
"Dreadful experience.  Room was very small and cramped with an unpleasant smell, noisy and ineffective air conditioning, with an outlook through a small dirty window to an even dirtier small courtyard.  “Bathroom” was no bigger than a broom cupboard with 2 small threadbare towels. Poor levels of cleanliness in the room particularly with the cups, which were badly stained.   The buffet breakfast was a joke, barely warm eggs and beans, toast and cereal, the choice is take it or leave it. Their publicity photographs must have been taken elsewhere as they bear no resemblance to the actual dining room. And the standards of hygiene leaves a lot to be desired, the kitchen assistant cleared used plates and wiped the tables with a dirty rag of a cloth, then replenished the beans and",1,-0.9633
"We have a booking for this Hotel in May, 2020 pre cruise. Our cruise has been cancelled as it was due to end in Shanghai which is now a no go zone. I booked this Hotel through Qantas who have tried to change the booking to next year when we will be in Singapore again. They refuse to adjust, move or refund our money. Every other Hotel has been decent enough to at least issue vouchers for use in the future. This Hotel has no heart, putting money before public relations. DO NOT STAY HERE on principal. ",1,-0.765
"10 mins walking from Orchad Rd, 40 mins from Gardens by the bay, 15 mins walking from Chinatown and 5 mins walking from Clarke Quay  The room was small but nice and clean with a lovely view on the river and the pool. We could also see Marina Sands Bay(the bow of the ship)  Room was cold all the time, even with air con off  Very few choices for brekfast",3,0.9253
"The location is perfect; walking distance to the National Museum (through Fort Canning Park) and Gardens By The Sea, with a metro stop only a few blocks away.  If you exit the lobby and turn to the left walking toward the water, then it is an easy right turn to the Robertson Quay restaurant scene, or by turning left not far from the famous Clark Quay eateries and shopping.  Or exit lobby and turn right and walk a block to the UE Square which includes a grocery store.  Yes, the room was small but very well organized; bathroom had plenty of space for toiletries.  The breakfast was very simple but eggs every morning so sufficient for my needs.  Keeping in mind that it was much more reasonable than other hotels, we would recommend and stay again.",3,0.822
We spent ome night at the Robertson Quay hotel in Singapore.The location was lovely.However the hotel room was extremely  small the bathroom was literally a hole on the wall and full of mould. The bed  sheet to our horror had a blood stain.On complaining to reception thete was no offer for another room nor did they offer to remake the bed with clean sheets .Instead they left 2 sheets which lacked any clean freshness  for us to deal with. The soiled sheet  was left with us.We are left to wonder how if at all the sheets are laundered.The towels too were  threadbare The aircondioning was freezing and couldn't be adjusted There was no hot water available in the early hours of the morning This hotel is a disaster avoid it,1,-0.8807
"Would stay again, rooms serviced everyday. rooms are compact but has everything we needed. Only thing was the threadbare linen and towels. One of my sheets was so thin that it ripped and towels did have holes in them. We bought some from little India. Great location, staff were pleasant and helpful",4,0.9369
"We had planned our vacation to Singapore this March however due to corona virus and current DORSCON level Orange at MOH Singapore we deferred our plans since we were traveling with senior citizens and an infant.  We requested Robertson Quay management multiple times to provide free cancellation looking at the situation but they never considered it.   We booked 45 days before and raised cancellation request 30 days before but no luck.   They are charging us 100% amount, a penalty of 900 SGD. This is ridiculous and totally unprofessional. My booking id is 519733 &amp; 519734.  Other hotel we booked were so kind and they understood the situation and refunded us 100% amount. Even it was booked under non refundable category.  Come on Robertson Quay Team this is totally unfair an",1,-0.809
"Had to change rooms as the  Toilet seat did not fit the pan, Electrical wires exposed ,holes in the sheets, no bedside table in either room Mould in the ceiling no precautions against Corona virus eg no hand cleaning liquids The breakfast was Cornflakes Coco pops Orange juice Toast Fried or Scrambled eggs Sausage ( Chicken) tasted like plastic Baked Beans. There was a fellow that cleaned the tables in a half hearted way and used the same cloth on his face Remember the virus was here, Toilets in the restaurant dirty.   Messed up the early morning call to catch our flight.   I will never stay here again of all the hotels I have stayed in this was the worst.",1,-0.8936
"I stayed in this hotel twice in January. Yes the rooms are small but they are clean and the staff are so helpful. It’s ideally located a short walk from fort canning station so very easy to get around the city. They have a reasonable size pool with a slide which is great for kids. Breakfast is included it’s basically toast, baked beans, eggs, cereal, juice, tea and coffee. On our first stay the shower wasn’t running well they immediately sent someone to fix and replace parts and was perfect. The knowledge of the staff is fantastic they were so helpful. We moved around to a few places in our trip and staying in this hotel was great as it’s affordable.",5,0.9946
"What we liked about this hotel is that it was ideally located for visiting most attractions in Singapore. Probably about 400m from the closest MRT. We walked to the Gardens by the Bay along the riverfront from the hotel. Clarke’s quay for food and live music is only a few minutes walk along the waterfront. The rooms are small and could do with more space for unpacking clothes, but very clean. There was a safe and a fridge in the room. The shower was great. The pool area was ok. The breakfast basic but can’t complain. I’d recommend having a room on a higher floor if possible. The 3rd floor where the pool is located don’t get much privacy or the views of the city.",4,0.9688
"There were three of us so there was a cot in the room, which greatly reduced the size!  We are family, so that helps but it was close.  The breakfast was adequate and the same each day. The little pool was refreshing mid-day when we would return to revive before going out in the evening.   The location is Excellent!!  Right on the river and walking distance to so much. There was a mall and grocery store, plus 7-11's close by too.  The MRT was just a block away.",4,0.8579
"We enjoyed our stay. Room was quite nice if somewhat oddly shaped which made for poor use of existing space. The location was excellent we walked or took metro everywhere. So nice to walk along the river and end up at inner harbor for lightshow and fireworks. Breakfast was ""meh"". Would not take much inspiration to improve it.",4,0.8809
"I stayed only 1 night and this was the one of worst hotel I ever stayed. The room was stinky, tiny that I hardly had room to put my suitcase and I squeeze myself to move from bed to bathroom. Towels were ripped off. Next morning, I couldn't find anything to eat from breakfast as there were 4-5 choices from bread to egg and tea/coffee etc.. I went out to Robertson Quey riverside restaurant to take my breakfast then moved out to another hotel immediately. Agoda photos are pretty deceiving and it was pricey, may be due to Christmas time..",1,-0.7003
Me husband and I spend 4 nights at Robertson Quay Hotel for our Honeymoon and we feel very disappointed about the hotel in general !!  1. Breakfast was the same meals every single morning’s and so poor breakfast  2. The amount of money that we paid for the hotel doesn’t match with the quality of the service’s that we expect.  3. Very small room  4. Towels was old and ripped!! The only good thing was the location!!  So please think twice because the hotel pictures in Agoda and TripAdvisor doesn’t match your expectations !!!,1,-0.6198
"Avoid this hotel if you can.  Except location not much that can be said.  Breakfast, wifi, room quality are sub standard.  Gym is a joke, rusted equipment and broken.  Front desk staff apathetic and indifferent.  Old hotel showing signs of wear and tear.  If not for the riverwalk stretch I think the 100USD per night I spent here is really a criminal waste of my money.",2,-0.9165
"This is a very basic hotel in a great location.  We only needed accommodation for one night for a family of 4, so it was affordable and in a great spot.  We had to book 2 rooms as they only have doubles and twins, the affordability was helpful to our budget.  The hotel is walking distance to Clarke Quay and Boat Quay is a little further on which was great.  The kids liked that there were 2 Starbucks nearby and small shopping mall as well.  The rooms are very small with not a lot of extra room, but everything is designed to fit and serve dual purpose, such as a bedside table that is also a chair, the bathroom door doubles as the shower door, but again it was only for one night so wasn't a problem for us.  The pool area was compact but good for a dip on a hot day.  The slide was a",4,0.9657

"In December this year I stayed for 5 nights. It was a small but comfortable room, perfect for 1 person. It was lovely and cool, with a great view over the pool and river. Staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel very clean. The free breakfast provided you with a good start to the day. The location is perfect. So close to everything, so walking was very easy along the river. Close to lots of places to eat. Only 5 minutes from the MRT at Fort Canning. Not far from the local Cold Storage and a number of 7 Elevens.",4,0.9957
"This is our first time to stay in this hotel and found out that the room was so small and you have to be very manageable to use the bathroom. Unless for any reason you need to be close with area, there are better hotels with small rooms in Singapore. Surprisingly there are more guests seen during breakfast time so I think they have quite good occupancy rate. Nearest MRT station is Clarke Quay and a little closer Fort Canning.",2,0.807

Beautiful city and beautiful people a tad expensive on accommodation But definerly worth the momey I would highly recommend it The garden by the bay  The universal studio The marina bay  And walk down the quays  I had lost my wallet  Which came back to me within 24 hours So its also a safe city with law abiding citizens,4,0.924

"Walked into my room one morning after breakfast (NOT at the hotel, their spread was TERRIBLE) and it stank of cigarettes. It was gone later that day. But I was awoken at 4 am by more cigarette stench. Moved to a higher floor and although the smell of people smoking was gone, the air-conditioning was stuck on my temperature: COLD, and the phone kept ringing even though one actually rang me. I had to unplug it. Local calls were charged reasonable at 10 cents per call. Late check out at a charge of $15 per hour. I have stayed in other budget hotels, so my expectations were realistic. But this hotel is NOT RECOMMENDED.",2,-0.8863
"This hotel was really close to local shops, restaurants as well as the Singapore River. It is fairly small, however perfect for someone who wants to explore the city. It was clean and neat. It is not the fanciest or newest looking hotel however it is perfect for the location.  ",3,0.9349
"Room was ‘compact but was clean as was the shower room. Space definitely at a premium but for our budget won’t complain too much except to say the 2 thin pillows and 2 thin towels left a lot to be desired!  Location was very good with views over the river and only a 10 minute walk into more central areas.  Pool was a bonus but as with the communal areas needs a lot of updating and keeping clean. Breakfast was a huge disappointment with limited choices ( 2 cereals, toast, eggs beans and hotdog sausages being only options) Also no proper bar area. There is a cold cabinet with some drink and snack options but the breakfast area could easily be used for a bar. ",2,0.9504
"We stayed at this hotel for the last part of our honeymoon, the room was tiny compared to the rooms we had stayed in Hongkong and Thailand. On arrival the receptionist said that we had a room with two single beds which as we are a couple and also on our honeymoon this isn’t what we asked for, after 10 mins she magically then found a “queen size” room for us which was more like a double bed and said that the travel agent hadn’t told them it was our honeymoon which 1 I find hard to believe as all the other hotels we stayed at knew, 2 even if they had made a mistake I don’t need that pointing out I just would like acknowledgement and understanding that’s it supposed to be a special time for us.

"Really well located next to Robertson Quay restaurants and Clarke Quay as well as public transport options. Also relatively close to Orchard, being just a 5 minute cab ride away.  Terrible rooms. Small, poorly furnished and run down. Cigarette butt stains in the bathroom. The thinnest towels I have ever seen in a hotel that wasn’t exclusively for backpackers.  At a similar rate the Holiday Inn or even the Ibis would be far better choices. ",2,0.742

"This is one of the worst hotels ever. The reception staff are unhelpful, the hotel is dirty and there is mould in the reception area on the walls and ceiling and there was also mould in our room. The rooms are basic and dirty, no toiletries and towels the size of a hand towel. Breakfast there is hardly anything g to choose from and the hot breakfast is cold. This hotel is saying it has a swimming pool but it is closed for maintenance and has been for some time. The hotel was that bad my family members checked out after the first night. Booking.com will not help you. Stay well away for the money you can get better",1,-0.7259

"Stayed there over the weekend with my kiddo and wife.  When we get into our room, we was shocked to realised that there is no bottled water served.  It might seems like a small issue, the triggering matter was the receptionist telling us to drink direct from the tap.  Breakfast was kind of bad.  The only option was hotdogs, eggs(scrambled and sunny side up), coco crunch and ceral. Not much of a choice and it was terrible in my perspective.  ",2,-0.7178
Really liked this hotel. Good amenties and close to Fort Canning Mrt. Breakfast was ok-ish. Would recommend this for short stay in Singapore. Nice swimming pool.Good aircon which is needed here. Some reviews say its noisy but I found it quite relaxing to sleep.,4,0.876

Aside from the pool which was a bit stinky, only realised once we'd used it.  Still,  was a geeat way to cool off, just needed a really good shower afterwards.    Breakfast was indeed questionable to Western palattes, but who complains about something that's free? Cold orange juice and water was wonderful.    All in all not the most amazing place I've ever been to but for the money well worth it. ",3,0.99
I just came back from Singapore yesterday after spend 3 days at this hotel for Study class with a group of friends. We are all agreed this hotel quite worth for money and Location. The hotel near by Font Canning Stm. And not far from tourist place. Hotel quite old but they provided clean room and BF not too bad. Room and toilet quite small so if for a big and tall people might not recommended. Staffs are friendly and help us to arranged a car to airport.

"I chose this hotel as it had everything I was looking for, and far cheaper than most others I considered. It's in an ideal location (near the MRT) and within walking distance of Chinatown and the Quays. The pool isn't particularly big but perfect for relaxing after a hard day's sightseeing. And there's a slide (see pic). There's no restaurant as such, but a western breakfast is served (free), although I preferred to venture out to the hawker centres. As per the title, the room is small but don't let that put you off. It has air-con, TV, safe, shower room and a fridge for your cold beers!! This is NOT a luxury hotel. Don't expect a myriad of restaurants, bars, or a concierge. But if you want a hotel with a pool in a good location, go ahead.",4,0.96
"Robertson Quay Hotel is a hotel in a great location. It is only 5 minute walk to the MRT(Singapore public transport rail system). 2 minute walk to bus stop. the hotel itself offers a cooked breakfat each morning at a limited buffet of Eggs, toast,beans and Jam, along with orange juice ,tea and coffee. 3rd floor has a great little swimming pool with good views . Rooms are small but the only negative I can find is the bathrooms are just too small. but at a good room rate I would recommend this hotel to anybody who is travelling to singapore on a budget but still getting good facilities and location to explore Singapore",4,0.872
"Booked through booking.com and on arrival were very disappointed as the staff at the desk did not greet or welcome us and no concierge. The hotel photos were deceiving (taken we would say when it was built a good 30 years ago) and was like an upmarket backpackers hotel. Our room was tiny and we got bed bug bights which required antibiotics when we arrived home in Australia. The breakfast was disgusting, precooked eggs and frankfurters cold baked beans.  No fruit. The worst hotel we have stayed at in all our travels through Asia. Another couple from Australia who we spoke with were also very disappointed and also felt deceived by the photos shown on booking.com as nothing like the photos.",1,-0.9614
We stayed here for 4 nights during the f1 grand prix.  Everything was perfect. Jennifer at front desk was very friendly as were the other staff. Our room 1008 had a great view. Just a 10min walk from clarke quay and 25min walk to marina bay or orchard rd.  The room was on the smaller side but it was fine.  Bed was comfortable.  Breakfast was included and yummy.  The pool was great especially with the hot and humid weather.  With all the expensive hotels around this one was a bargain to everything else and would stay here again if going for the F1.   It's a basic hotel but during our stay would give it 5 stars.,4,0.9803

Despite the fact that they were busy with arrivals and departures, they took the time to show me two different rooms. I reserved immediately and checked in the next day. The price was very reasonable and the room had everything I wanted amenities-wise (plus fast internet) . A bit smallish but with a window overlooking the the nearby waterfront, perfect.

The room I booked had a double bed and a single bed and stated that it could accommodate 4 people. When we arrived, we found that it could accommodate 4 people...but just barely. It was a very tight squeeze for the four of us, and when we set up our 1 year old's portable bed, we couldn't access the bathroom or the door out (bit of a fire hazard...). We made up our minds to just make the best of it since we weren't planning on spending a lot of time in the room anyway.

Booked it on the internet in a rush which was probably our main mistake. It looked ok in the site pictures in the Robertson Quay area. However on arrival we realised we had chosen poorly. The Hotel is in a very run down state and I guess it was built in the 70""s. The room are very small and the bathroom even smaller. However it's main failing was the bed.

"The hotel is in a great location - close to Metro stations, bus stops, Fort Canning, the river and its surrounding restaurants and other places. The rooms are compact and very cleverly designed as they are mainly segments of a circle in floor layout. The people on reception are very helpful. The breakfast was basic (scrambled eggs, fried eggs, baked beans, frankfurters, cereals, fruit juice, tea, coffee, toast) - a good start for the day and a break from the exotic food that we ate elsewhere all the time. The WiFi needs to be redesigned - it presents as multiple networks (one per floor?) but was very patchy, especially in the rooms. The hotel fills a niche between expensive hotels and hostels. (We heard that Airbnb is not quite legal in Singapore.) So we were glad we found it.",4,0.8767
"A year ago I stayed in this rubbish hotel. Upon stepping into my room, I found a number of live cockroaches on the floor, walls and ceiling!!  I checked out less than hour later.  This showed how bad this hotel was.  Was told very recently, a friend of mine happened to also stayed in this hotel.  She also found cockroaches and lizards everywhere in her room!.

The mattress had springs that poke you all night, 2 basic pillows, &amp; no blanket left me cold &amp; sleeping in my cardigan. The room &amp; bathroom were both tiny. The hot water was more lukewarm. Wifi dipped in &amp; out a bit. The good parts were the close proximity to public transport &amp; Clarke Quay. Breakfast was passable for a short stay (any longer &amp; the limited food options would start to get dull very quick). The pool is small but nice if not too crowded.

Don’t stay on second floor as you can hear the lobby there is no separation (roof) in between and you can hear breakfast from 7:30am. Pool is fine and lovely to have in singapore. There is warm but not hot water in the room. Breakfast is terrible - two types of eggs not well cooked and cheap sausage and beans. Not worth including in your stay.

We stayed for 9 nights. Before our visit we called the hotel to ask how we could guarantee a room with a river view. They advised booking a superior room so we did. On arrival after 2 x 7 hour flights we were assigned a top floor room with a view of the hotel next door. It was late so we slept. Next morning after breakfast we enquired about a room with a river view at reception. She phoned our room about 2 hours later and we moved to floor 6 with a fabulous river view. We found reception staff very friendly and courteous at all times.  The room was very well maintained at all times and was always spotlessly clean. If it became too cold we switched off the air con. As others have said no bar soap was provided so we brought our own. The in room hairdryer was hard to find but,4,0.8633

Checkin took our group of 10 people 45 minutes. We had all booked but they had nothing prepared in advance. The check in procedure is all done manually. It takes ages. The room was the smallest I’ve ever been in. It had a single door which doubled as the shower and the bathroom door- unbelievable really. The main door didn’t close properly and had to be slammed. Breakfast was terrible. I suppose you get what you pay for but I’ve spent 30% more and had much better rooms in Singapore. I could not possibly recommend this hotel. ,1,-0.521

We requested for rooms on specific floors during the booking but only left with rooms on the lowest floor when check-in; we asked that we indicated such request and how come it was all taken? The reception staff just simply answer ""it's on a first come first serve basis""; if that's being the case, what is the purpose for the hotel to ask the guest to indicate their room preference and the estimated arrival time?   3.

I found this to be a good budget hotel. Rooms are in the smaller side but not enough to complain about. It is a no frills hotel but clean and friendly. My grandson loved the pool. If you like food there is lots of it within a very short walk. We were lucky enough to receive a promotion of 2 nights at the sister resort on santosa island for $50. That was heaven and we are very grateful. I would have no problem staying here again,4,0.9788

About the hotel, room is quite small but its worth the money I paid for. Everything is clean, the towels, bedsheets are still new.

"This is a great little hotel for Singapore. Considering it's location and being only a 3 star hotel in my eyes is pretty impressive.   Rooms are comfortable, yes they are probably a lot smaller than most but when I go on holidays the room is a place to sleep not hang out.   Breakfast was pretty basic. It had toast  eggs, sausages, baked beans, cereals, juice, tea and coffee. We didn't even realise breakfast was included for guests so this saved us $20 a day.   The pool and gym were small and the pool had a cool slide you could go down.  Staff were impressive and always friendly.   Wifi was average as it always dropped in and out.
