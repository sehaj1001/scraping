"Stayed level 8, one night on transit from Manila to Melbourne.   Obviously it’s a super convenient location for a layover. Adjacent to Terminal 3, Crown plaza offers a fairly standard room which overlooked the runway. The TV is a fair distance from the bed and the screen is quite small. The view over the runway is great. The pool is also nice.   Breakfast was lacklustre. Fairly simple choices and bland food, in retrospect not worth the additional cost, especially since we were heading to a lounge at the airport.  We arrived late at night (after midnight). The escalators were switched off so too all the exterior hallway lights. They claim they are trying to be “environmentally aware”. The frustration is the lack of assistance given for late night check ins. Had to lug two 40kg",3,0.7866
"I stayed at the Crowne Plaza Changi Airport in December 2019. During the stay, I made a reservation for a runway view room with an additional rollaway bed.   I had stayed at the hotel previously and I am surely and slowly convinced that the standards and the IHG brand name are not in-line.  The following were areas I felt where improvements are needed:  Housekeeping/Maintenance: 1- while turning on the tap in the room, I noted spurting sounds from the tap. The water that flowed out appeared to be slightly murky. The same situation happened for the bathtub as well. I had to spent 5 minutes turning on all the taps to be sure that the water cleared up.   2- there was also a mild yellow stain on the pillow. Personally, this is unacceptable especially when I was told the room was",2,0.8271
I stayed here one night in mid-February for an early morning flight to Bali.  I stayed in a Rm o nthe 6th floor.  The hotel is located in Terminal 3.  There are signs in Terminal 3 that will point you to it.  It is near the Skytrain(train that goes between terminals) entrance in Terminal 3.    This hotel like any other Crown Plaza hotel is at least a 4 star hotel by Western standard or 5 star depending on your standards.  The room I stayed in certainly reflected it.  The room I was in was very spacious compared with the average hotel room.  Upon entering the room you pass the bathroom on the right.  Entering the bathroom there is a large deep tub on the left.  On the right is a sink with counter and pass that is the shower.  At the back is the toilet.  The bathroom is spacious,5,0.5994
Extremely comfortable rooms that are well-designed and feature a large bathroom with modern shower. Friendly and courteous staff. Highly recommended if you need to stay near the airport since the hotel is directly connected to SIN's T3.,5,0.9039
Regardless of terminal you will reach the hotels within minutes using the Sky train. We stayed three persons in a room with runway view. If you are a keen plane spotter these rooms are perfect. The beds were comfortable and there was plenty of space for an extra bed. Room was very clean and well furnished. Check in and check out was without problem and staff was very friendly and efficient. From the hotel you have easy access to the fantastic shopping mall Jewel and to the downtown train. If you are a plane spotter and on a budget you can opt for a less expensive room and go to the viewing area at terminal one.,5,0.9845
"When I sometimes want to relax and can't afford the time to travel overseas then Crowne Plaza Changi Airport it is.   I've stayed at this property no less than 6 times over 2 years and each time I come back, I am thinking of my next stay again here. The front desk executives are efficient and normally upgrade me to the Business Wing but if you're not keen to walk a too far to your room, just get the the rooms in the main wing.  This hotel is linked to T3 and also a short walk to the Jewel at Changi Airport so you'll never run out of dining or shopping options. That said, I don't suppose you'll ever need to leave the hotel as you will have no time left to relax by the magnificent pool area or just soak in the bath tub.   The hotel is also under the IHG network so I am accorded",5,0.8775
This hotel is connected to Changi's Terminal 3 which makes it very convenient if you are on transit. Room is spacious and comfortable. What stands out is the service. My friends wanted to surprise me with a birthday cake since I was traveling on my birthday. The staff managed to organize it with them and delivered it to my room to my surprise. Great stay!,5,0.9324
"To be clear, I have not had a chance to actually visit and stay at this hotel. However, we had planned to stay there and our trip/cruise was canclled. The hotel staff were so accommodating and understanding that they let us cancel without penalty. They were also very responsive and professional. That is HUGE. We plan to get to Singapore in the next year or so and will absolutely stay here!  Looking forward to it!",5,0.8294
My title says it all. A walk or short train ride from the terminal. A very speedy check-in. Very comfortable room. Good swimming pool to refresh oneself after a long flight. Easy access to the Jewel shopping mall - which is fantastic. Perfect hotel for a late arrival or early departure.,5,0.961
"Never again...this place. Wh9le industry slowdown..but this place wants the maximum yield...hopeless, check in 300 pm...check out 1200 noon, how it constitutes to 1 day  don’t know...stay 18hours ..but pay 24/hours...and occupancy was poor...no effort for extending on request....terrible in this troubled times..working to maximise,profit.",1,-0.5994
The good thing about this hotel is the location- easy access not only for the airport but also Singapore transpiration system. The staff are extremely friendly and it is always a pleasure to stay there.,5,0.9286
"We missed our connecting flight, and needed a place to stay.  Super convenient.  There was also a restaurant at the hotel.  Extra treat to have a view of the planes taking off and landing.  Nice to be able to leave the hotel and be connected to the airport.",5,0.7906
Stayed here after a late flight change. Very convenient and comfortable. Connected to airport and has monitors in the hotel to check for flight changes. The service was friendly and accommodating. Good experience.,5,0.8646
"So easy to get to and well signed from within the terminal. Slick registration and fabulous room with airport view. Room service efficient and food superb - try the Wagyu burger! A haven of calm in a currently crazy world and minutes from Terminal 1, if you’re trying to get back to Europe.",5,0.9412
Stayed overnight on our way back from Australia to UK. Met our needs completely. Beautiful spaces and gardens. Room was comfortable with everything we needed. No luggage so unable to enjoy the pool or fitness centre,4,0.8969
"The hotel is perfect if you travel on from Singapore and just have to remain one night close to the area port. Of course, you will hear the planes taking of and landing but in general the rooms are quiet. The room we had wasn't very luxurious and not what I expected with that price level. I would recommend travellers to use a hotel in the city and drive ind and out with a cab, it's much cheaper.",3,0.6808
"We stayed in the Crowne on the way to the Maldives and were then put up there for a night by Singapore Airlines after our flight had to be cancelled.  Either as a paid guest or an over-nighter by the airlines, we received the same great service and room.  Very convenient location.  Lovely clean rooms.  Great breakfast.  Quick and efficient check in and out.  Terrific place to have a clean and quiet nights rest.",5,0.9704
Had a full day in Singapore after a busy holiday.  Elected to check in to this property and chill.  Excellent decision.  Selected a room opening on to the pool deck which is also the floor with the conceirge lounge.  Pool is marvelous with nooks and crannies and an in-water exercise bike.  Lounge is usual excellent Asian lounge.  Hotel is at the airport and has good restaurants on premises. It was a very relaxing day.,5,0.9657
"Only stayed here for 1 night between flights,  so glad we broke up our flight back to the UK here. Room was well appointed,  bed so comfortable.  Interesting bathroom arrangement but the internal blind worked well.  The pool looked very inviting.  We ate at the Azur restaurant both for an evening meal and breakfast - excellent choices and service for both.  A visit to the Jewel was a must.  We arrived when Covid 19  was around and found the hotel and the airport so quiet. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay here, would definitely stay again if in the area.",5,0.9781
Another great overnight stay breaking up the flights from Heathrow to Melbourne. Quick check in to our Premier room which overlooked the garden. Lovely swim and couple of hours relaxing by the pool before visiting Jewel which was amazing! Very comfortable bed which enabled a good night’s sleep.  Breakfast good before our onward flight to Melbourne.,5,0.9798
Lovely room with nice touches - bathroom is novel with the blind.  Outdoor pool is great and very calming in the middle of an airport.  Slept well with no disturbances.  Great location from transferring from a flight to doing a spot of shopping in Jewel.  The hotel team service was impeccable. Well done.,5,0.9612
"We stayed over night at the Crowne Plaza Airport and had the most comfortable, relaxing and wonderful stay.  The room was so clean, comfortable and we both felt like a home away from home.  We had a friend who visited us and she passed the same remark and said if she had the opportunity some time in the future she would like to stay over night.  The staff at the Reception was very friendly and helpful and made us welcome which is an added bonus.  From the hotel we visited the Jewel for the first time and it was just perfect after dinner to come back ""home""to the Crown Plaza Airport to get a good night's sleep to catch the early flight for our onward journey.  Thank you Crowne Plaza Changi Airport for a welcome and wonderful overnight stay in Singapore which we both thoroughly",5,0.9956
"We stayed at this airport hotel for one night in February 2020.  The staff here are all friendly and helpful and our room was clean, comfortable and well stocked. There is no safe in the room but just a small valuables box in a draw, if that matters to you.   We had  a view of the pool below and the control tower too. We thought the Jewel was great to visit and this hotel at Terminal 3 has easy access to everything.  It's quite well soundproofed but you will still hear airplanes taking off  We used the Executive lounge and met some great staff here, especially Raymond who is a total credit to the company. He makes sure all his guests are looked after. We tried a Singapore Sling here and it was better than Raffles!",5,0.9926
"We stayed here from 2nd to 6th March during the virus health scare. The hotel is next to Changi Airport and the famous Jewel centre in Terminal 3. There is a transit SKytrain which you take from Terminal 1 on arrival to T3. This was a very good base for us, for the Metro train into Singapore each day. The hotel was peaceful and calm. It was obvious that the staff were taking safety precautions but in a quiet and calm way. During our stay we noticed it was quiet but in a good way. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was very clean and a great size.  As we were suffering from Jet Lag we were left undisturbed to rest each day in our room. There was no pressure for the housekeeping etc.  Each day housekeeping  left bottled water and toiletries including toothbrushes",5,0.9668
This hotel is strategically located at the airport area. This was our second time staying here and we were not disappointed. Quiet room and the food was excellent.The new shopping centre Jewel is next door and great eatery areas all walking distance.,5,0.8463
"One night stopover between flights and anticipated great things from supposedly the best on airport hotel in the world.  Comfortable yes.  Great location for the MRT and good for the Jewel, yes.  But average food and only just average value for money.  Maybe if you are prepared to shell out another 100 SGD per night for a premium room you might get a wow factor but you still might be better off eating in the terminal and definitely downtown if you have the time to jump on the EW line.  Came away a bit underwhelmed.",4,0.9756
"It was really convenient staying at the airport and I’m glad we made that choice. The hotel is very nice and the entrance is very nice. The rooms are a little bit beat up with scratches here and there, but for the location, pool and service, it is worth staying here. They even dropped off a mini cake for our special occasion and upgraded us to a room with a view.  You can use the app “grab” to get a lift to the gardens by the bay for about 18 SGD one way from the jewel. The walk to the terminal train was quick and to the jewel as well. We would stay here again!",5,0.9609
"The level of service from the time we’ve arrived until our departure was impeccable. Considering we are at an Intl airport we slept amazingly well so peaceful and yet so close to the departure lounge. Public transport is so affordable and secure, the cbd is around the corner. Obviously  a short walk to the world renown  “Jewel”  We are from Cairns Australia and we are on a well deserved retirement tour. We are definitely recommending this hotel as it ticks all the boxes of a 5 stars. High five to all staff. We will return no doubts.   Max &amp; Françoise ",5,0.8806
"Had always stayed at this hotel before flying off, but this time a staycation! And we were not disappointed at all. Despite the current situation of the coronovirus, there were no difference in their offerings and standard of service. As usual, room was very clean and comfortable, breakfast selection was superb, Executive Lounge still offers a variety of delicious canapes and wine/spirits during cocktail. As we stayed during the Singapore Airshow period, we were lucky to have caught a glimpse of the show through our windows! Great stay, and will always come back again.",5,0.9872
"In May 2019 I reserved a Deluxe room in the Jewel Wing for 21 January 2020. On 18 January, I received an email from the hotel informing me that: ""...the Jewel Wing will undergo minor rectification works during your stay. Therefore for this booking, we will be giving you a complimentary upgrade to a King Size Bed Premier Room, located at the Main Building"".   Neither my wife nor I like the rooms in the Main Building because the air conditioning blows directly into your face when in bed. After an exchange of emails, I was advised that a Deluxe room would be available on the 2nd Floor of the Jewel Wing.  On arrival at the hotel, I was surprised to be informed that no rooms were available in the Jewel Wing, which seems odd given the number of floors &amp; rooms, &amp; the use of the term",4,0.8717
"We had an overnight stay here. On arrival we were delighted to find out that we had been upgraded to a Deluxe Room with two Queen size beds, which were very comfortable. The large room was very clean and had a lovely ambience. It was also very quiet which was fantastic as our flight arrived in the early hours of the morning. We had no trouble getting to sleep and we were able to have a well-needed rest. The room had a TV, coffee/tea maker, complimentary water, iron/ironing board, robes, slippers and was air-conditioned. The bathroom had lovely toiletries like shampoo, conditioner and a separate tub and shower. The staff were very friendly and helpful. They even managed a late checkout when they found out our flight from Singapore didn’t leave until late afternoon. This was very",5,0.9817
I normally stay on this hotel before heading to my nxt destination. It saves time and enjoy Singapore in one roof for a short period of time. Shopping is just across - Jewel. MRT connects you to downtown and marina. Local delicacies offered on basement 2 where you can try ample of asian cuisine. Early checkin at 11am - not bad!,4,0.8335
"We got stuck in Singapore  for 24 hours and got this hotel. If you have time go to the swimming pool, its amazing. The rooms are really nice and comfy too. The food in the hotel restaurant was also really nice.",5,0.8396
"Our trip to Singapore was very stressful. My fiancé is Kenyan and when we arrived at Changi Airport - they made it very difficult for her. This is an amazing airport - but because she is of a different skin colour she is racially profiled. As we waited in line each person was expedisiously seen through immigration until my Sly hit the counter. Then it was question after question. The man behind me in the line noticed and said ""does this happen to you all the time?"" I said ""yes - I follow her through immigration because of this."" He said ""not fair.""  Then I was called up and her answers were cross checked - we had a full typed out itinerary.  That brings me to the hotel.  What a stress reliever! The checkin was great and I jumped in a pool (for a minute or two) it was cold and it",5,0.85
We stayed here on our way out from the Uk to Australia and our way back too. Raymond went well out of his way to accommodate us and made our stay perfect. His attentiveness and diligence really stand out. He is always there day and night and never stops working hard to make sure all the guests with club house benefits get the best deal possible. He went out of his way to make sure my coeliac partner was given more choices. He made this review 5 star. The rest of the hotel is ok but I feel it’s expensive for what it is. They could do with updating their TV choices in the rooms for travellers staying here to kill time between flights   Great job Raymond. Let’s hope they give you a raise. You are a credit to the company and a real asset.   Thank you for looking after us ,5,0.9699
"We had an overnight stopover here. It’s an excellent hotel to stay in - comfortable, good sized rooms, very clean, attractive layout with courtyards and a beautiful swimming pool. Excellent breakfast available. The staff are courteous and efficient. I recommend this hotel highly. ",5,0.9852
Love stopping over at Singapore and getting a restful nights sleep. Close to Jewel for shopping and great food. Staff are excellent very helpful and happy. The executive lounge is always great. Right in the airport complex so you can clear customs and head straight in. No cab or inclement weather to deal with. ,5,0.9836
"One night stay. Check in smooth, room excellent, proximity to planes and Jewel excellent. Beautiful hotel. My only complaint was how dark it was. It was intentional, but I sure dont know why. Food was mediocre, but when you have 100 places to eat within 200 yards you are doomed to fail. The magnificent Jewel complex next door fills the void. Hotel would be great just because it is so close to the airport. But add equal proximity to the new showplace, Jewel is a huge bonus. ",5,0.9747
"Modern, large comfortable room, nice pool and gym, located next to the must-see Jewel and with easy access to the terminals. The dark marble in the entrance and reception area is a bit forbidding, but the there is nothing to fault and the staff were all excellent. A great place to start recovering from jet lag.  We happened to see a screen in the reception featuring deals for a breakfast and a senior lunch, both of which were very enjoyable and at a cost that made us feel better about the cost of the one night room stay.",5,0.9762
"I love Jewel so when my husband suggested a staycation at Crowne Plaza hotel, I said yes immediately.   We checked in in Dec and was told that we were upgraded (the staycay was off to a great start already). Room was comfortable, we had a swim at the pool which has a great view of the airport control station.   Shopped and ate the day away at Jewel and glad we had this break away from the city.

"Due to the recent virus, took the opportunity to book a room to celebrate my wife's birthday. Wrote in to IHG to arrange for a small birthday gesture for her and to my dismay, the reply was to write in to another email or call. Tried calling but no one picks up.  The booking experience somehow already marred my impression of the 5 star Hotel. Thank goodness the check in process was fast and reception was knowledgeable about the promotion.  The best staff that impressed me the most was Chef Herman who was manning the egg counter. He is jovial and greeted any guest who walked past him.  In terms of amenities, room is spacious but poorly equipped with an uncovered wardrobe and a small TV. Other than coffee and tea sachets, we were greeted by empty fridge that allows us to place in",3,0.98
Ideal location right on the airport with easy access. Luxurious rooms.  Great wifi.  Good restaurants.  The hotel is right next to a state of the art shopping centre.  Lovely pool to relax in too. We only stayed for one night but it would be very easy to stay longer .....not something you would often say about a hotel on an airport ,5,0.9306
"Five star hotel with all the features but right next to Terminal 3 and Jewell shopping centre. You would only stay here if transiting or on an early morning flight as, apart from the shopping at Jewell, there is nothing else to do. However, the rooms are large, beds fabulous, terrific pool and lots of cheap food and a supermarket next door in the basement of Terminal 3.",5,0.8674
"We stayed in the Crowne Plaza  because of its location.   We needed to overnight between Penang and our Dubai to Heathrow flight.   It was rather like marmite in the decor. -  either love it or hate it.  I'm afraid I'm with the latter.   So dark. (the room was ok)  and I didn't really like the fact we had to go to level 2 in the lift. -  long walk down the corridor to another lift to get to our room on level 3 of a different building.   Good location though straight into the airport complex, and Jewel,  the large shopping mall with its myriad eateries.   So apart from reception which was OK if a bit impersonal,  and the room which was very nice,  we didn't really see much else the hotel had to offer.   The bed was beautifully comfortable.",4,0.9703
"When you book and pay for 3 persons incl. taxes you expect to have paid for everything. When we arrive we are asked if we want a bed for the 3 person (our 13 Year old kid). Yes we would like to have an extra bed. Then you will have to pay 66 SGD on top of what we already paid for 3 persons. There where not an extraordinary welcome, what we have experienced on other 5-stars hotel. The room was ok. It was very noisy during night (flights and awful weather). Ofcourse we can expect some noice as it is located in the airport, but we have expected more silence Windows. We will rather get earlier up and take a taxi.",3,0.0293
"I stayed here end December 2019. The welcome by the reception staff made me feel at home. The room was large, clean and had a view over the pool. The bathroom and bath were huge and again spotless. I slept very well. Breakfast gave a huge choice of dishes from Asian to bacon and eggs! All freshly cooked. The hotel is ideal for a short stay and gives access to the various gardens in Changi.",5,0.937
"Got a room with a view of the runway of aeroplanes taxi in and out of the runway. Bathroom is huge and amenities provided are good. Breakfast is the only something that need alot improvement Have lounge access and I can say this is one of the best lounge experience, cool staff service, nice canapes and breakfast (better than the restaurant bf) and nice ambient. Worth getting room with lounge access.  ",5,0.9648
"If you are either doing a stop over or a short break and like an airport environment then this is the place to stay. If you are a 'plane spotter', you can pay to upgrade your room for a runway view and you certainly will not be disappointed. I certainly wasn't. The staff are amazing, nothing is too much trouble for them to acceed to your request.",5,0.8102
"flying from Australia to anywhere takes its toll. after 8 hrs to Singapore and before you cramp yourself into your next airplane seat, do yourself a favour and take a few hours to relax at the crown plaza. accessible from the terminal it is an easy walk to the sky train to access any other terminal. the beds are comfortable, the rooms are quiet, and the bathrooms spacious with a deep bath. there is a gym and pool for relaxation before you embark on your onward journey.",4,0.9274
Stayed overnight whilst on route to Vietnam. Excellently located in Changi Airport. Pleasant and friendly staff. Room was as you would want it....clean and quiet. Bed was probably a little hard for my liking but I still had a great nights sleep. Would definitely use the Crown Plaza again.,5,0.9513
"My wife and I stayed here overnight for a brief Singapore visit on our way back to the US. The hotel is directly connected to terminal  3 and is steps away from the pedestrian tunnel to Jewel, plus a very short walk to the subway station to Singapore, so there could not be a better location! Our room in the hotel was very large, including the bathroom. We took a late check out package - they have several - for a night flight, so they are extremely accommodating to passengers, naturally. The room has nice amenities and the bed is extremely comfortable. Soundproofing is excellent so you do not hear the planes. The restaurant has an excellent buffet breakfast. This would be a wonderful hotel if it were in the city, but as an airport location it is perfect!",5,0.9426
"Only a 1 night stay between connecting flights, but what a fabulous room, very comfortable beds, all toiletries provided I hardly needed my overnight bag. Got a good deal so was well worth the money and better than spending overnight in the airport departure lounge ( as good as Changi is) would consider this for another stay in Singapore as very good links into centre. Arrived in early hours but were very quickly checked in and taken to room. Opted for their buffet breakfast , what an amazing choice  with excellent service,",5,0.9923
"This hotel is normally about $200 a night.  It does cost 40,000 points but well worth it.  The hotel is part of the airport complex so you can walk to Terminal 2 and 3 and reach the others by the train.  It is a modern hotel with a nice restaurant.  Our upgraded room was huge with plenty of area to set 4 suitcases.  The bathroom was also large with a nice walk in shower and jacuzzi.",5,0.9382
"This is our second stay at the Crowne Plaza Changi. Both stays were excellent. Staff were professional, friendly, helpful and spoke excellent English. Great location for morning flight from Singapore airport. We were able to check into our room a bit early which was very nice. The room was  large, quiet, clean, modern and everything worked properly. The bathroom was very nice. We spent the afternoon in Singapore and ate dinner at the airport. The only negative change from our earlier visit was the business center is now a single laptop without an attached printer. You can email a document to the check in desk and they will print it. The bed was very comfortable and we had a great night's sleep. We saved some time by using the express checkout. We would stay at this hotel again.",5,0.9863
"Stayed here for two nights,before travelling back to Stockholm.the hotel is great,staff superb,mega comfy bed, sheets&amp; duvet were gorgeous.super bathroom.in fact I loved everything about this hotel. I don’t need to list everything.it even had a nice swimming pool.Even that had a view now not every one will want a runway view of an airport or listening to planes.it never disturbed our sleep, and we loved it.Changi Airport is a super airport anyway, but to stay here, and take the sky train to our terminal.we will ALWAYS make this hotel part of our holiday, when we are in this part of the world.happy hour in the bar from 17.00-1900,2 for 1 meals at dinner,whats not to like.WE WILL BE BACK.",5,0.9108
"Beautiful hotel, spacious room, gorgeous bathroom (glass shower, large tub) We could walk to our gate. Changi airport is so amazing, and we had access to so many different restaurants and shops. Loved staying here!",5,0.9581
"We booked an overnight stay here as we had a connecting flight early the next morning and were pleasantly surprised. Luckily we were arriving and departing from Terminal 3 where this hotel is situated to it was super convenient. It's also well situated for visiting the Changi Jewel shopping mall.  Be warned that if you are staying in the Jewel wing it's a long walk to get to your room, and an even longer one if you want to visit the Jewel! When I queried with reception that said you have to pay a higher rate to stay in the wing closer to the reception area.",4,0.9577
"Staycation is a great deal for people like us who get to relax only for 2 days out of 365, and Crowne Plaza Changi Airport made it a memorable one with their superb hospitality!  Reservation and Check-in/out Flawless! No miscommunication at all, quick check-in and out.  Room Very comfortable and cosy. There were enough sockets for basic needs. Quality bathroom amenities that were replenished daily.  F&amp;B Most memorable was the Club Lounge. Food was delicious and menu was well planned. Lounge looks out to the swimming pool, adding to a sense of relaxation.  Service Impeccable service set this hotel apart from the rest. So much warmth and soul, staff really served with passion. Special mention goes to the following persons: 1)  Mr Vikram, Hotel Manager who ensured that our stay was",5,0.9893
I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Crowne Plaza at Changi Airport Singapore. The room was comfortable and clean. The service of the front office was excellent. Room service was quite tasty. And the location is hard to beat for an airport hotel.,4,0.9168
We were so happy with Crowne Plaza 4 years ago that we decided to stayed there one night as a stopover in Singapore again.  We got a good night sleep and were not disappointed.  My kids keep wanting to come back just to stay in the hotel!,5,0.8882
We booked into this hotel because of our flight schedule thinking it would be convenient. Will it turn out to be a fantastic place to stay we are thinking about returning to Singapore and using it as our base for 10 nights. Really comfortable clean and plenty of food options. Great for family’s.,5,0.9357
Had my reunion dinner here and the spread was awesome. Theres food for all ages. The magic tricks performed my Ian Tan was very cool too! This is my second time here for reunion and I believe there will be a third :),5,0.8585
We stayed here one night because our flight got in very late. The staff is very professional and friendly. The rooms are spacious and clean. The super-comfortable bed and pillows had me sleeping like a baby here. I read some complaints about noise from the airplanes being so close by but I didn't hear it at all. It's connected to Terminal 3 provides quick access to the new Jewel shopping center and the MRT.,4,0.7377
"WOW.  This hotel BLEW my mind away. It was so clean, the staff ever so helpful, the rooms incredibly modern AND the buffet at the restaurant could not be described other than being out of this world! The location, service, quality and so much more really sells itself and I cannot wait to return and experience the brand NEW Jewel wing to see what it is like.  Thank you for making my short stay so worthwhile and memorable - I am looking forward to returning! 12/10",5,0.9714
"Very conveniently located. I had a night to spend in singapore and decided to go out with friends. The hotel does late check out, and the rooms are so big and nice. Only issue was the sound of aeroplane's engines at all hours. After awhile it does get annoying, so definitely don't stay here for more than a day!",4,0.8046
The location of this hotel at Changi makes it super convenient for short stop overs. I found it easy to find and only a short train ride away from terminal one. The room was spacious and clean and I wasn’t bothered by airport noise. The surrounds are very pretty and staff friendly. Can’t be beaten for short stop overs,5,0.8268
"Connected to the airport in Singapore, Crowne Plaza was the perfect hotel to crash after a late arrival. There was a lovely, calm and spacious pool. Though the pillows weren’t great, we still had a good night’s sleep. The buffet breakfast in the Premier Lounge had a good assortment of food.",5,0.9517
We stayed here on our way from London to Auckland. It was a lovely break after a 13 hour flight. Staff and facilities were excellent and we would stay there if making the same journey..  The hotel is located within the airport complex and we had time to walk round the numerous shop and visit The Jewel which a must if passing through Changi.    ,5,0.875
"Whether you’re at Changi Airport for a short layover or for a few days, this is your perfect option for accommodation. The hotel is connected to Terminal 3. Within five minutes of leaving the hotel you’re in the ticketing and departure area. You can also access the hotel by taking the SkyTrain from other terminals.   Staff at check-in were welcoming and friendly. The hotel has a peaceful vibe. The rooms have floor to ceiling glass windows and are a very nice size. I enjoyed sitting by the pool area. It’s shaded with tall palm trees. They also have an excellent fitness center that provides cardiovascular and strength training machines. There are also stretch mats and Swiss balls. Approximately a 5 to 10 minute walk is The Jewel where you have all the shopping and dining you need.",5,0.9837
"Our family of 6 stayed here overnight on our way back to Australia from Europe. We booked 3 rooms, all different. Each room was clean, tidy and had excellent amenities provided. The location is excellent for transit travellers or even if you choose to stay here whilst in Singapore. The atmosphere at the hotel was very relaxing, even with the close proximity to the planes etc. The walk bridge to Jewel Shopping plaza is easily accessible &amp; a must visit if you have time. I will definitely stay here again next time in Singapore.",5,0.9647
So easy to get to on arrival and so easy to depart from as well. The staff were very helpful and friendly. The room was large with a full size bath and a king bed. The pool was very relaxing with lots of beds and chairs. Very expensive food and drink but it is Singapore. Breakfast was $35 Singapore each but we were sent an offer before we arrived which offered breakfast for 2 for $40 which is the only reason we ate there. Terrific choice and food. Delicious. You don’t have to eat there. Lots of choice in the Jewel. Easy access to the MRT. Took about 25 minutes to China town. Their train system is the best and so easy to follow. We will stay there again if we go back to Singapore for the sheer convenience. ,4,0.9896
This place is heaven. We were a family of 6 and we had interconnecting rooms. The pool was spectacular. And the staff couldn't do enough for you. Room service was yummmm and a good price.  The place was very clean and it was just a short walk to the departure gate.,5,0.8479
"The hotel is very convenient to Terminal 3 and the entire Changi airport. The rooms are very comfortable but ugly. Ask for a room facing the pool not the runway. The rooms open onto an open hallway, so it's muggy and polluted from the runway. Nice pool. Spa does not open until 10am. Breakfast in Azur restaurant was very unpleasant: crowded buffet and harsh lighting. Service is Singapore standard, which means good and attentive.",3,-0.8569

"Stayed here for the day as had a very late night flight.  Contacted hotel to ask for early check in as was arriving around 9am but leaving around 9pm. This was acknowledged however the guy at check in was quite abrupt and said I should have booked from the night before - however this would mean check out at 3pm- 9 hours before my flight , eventually though he let us check in - think that was more as I was a gold IHG member.  To the hotel itself though - it’s stunning - amazing pool area - big clean modern rooms with all the facilities - if visit Singapore again would consider staying here and travelling into the city  It’s right in the airport and connected to the jewel so Great for shopping and food etc ",4,0.977
"Stylish and upscale hotel. The front desk staffs were polite and friendly. The lights on the 02nd level - the path leading to the hotel rooms were a little dim. The room was slightly more than mediocre. The color palette and scheme in the room was a little dull and gloomy. There was a full mirrored wall in front of the bed, with the TV hanging on that wall. Some experts say that : ""A mirror facing the bed depletes your personal energy and creates sleeplessness. Because the mirror doubles and bounces all sorts of energy, it disrupts the tranquility needed in a bedroom for better sleep."" ""A mirror reflecting the bed brings nightmares. An explanation for this is that when we sleep at night, our soul leaves the body. When the soul sees its own reflection, it gets startled, hence the",4,0.7996
"This was our fourth stay at the Crowne Plaza Changi Airport, with the first one nearly 10 years ago. The hotel has only improved in this time. Check in was prompt and friendly and our room was cool, spacious and inviting with a great view over the pool area. After s relaxing swim, we slept soundly. We had lounge access and I was really impressed with the cocktail hour and the generous breakfast the following morning. Well done Crown Plaza! I am a Platinum Elite IHG member had had considered switching my loyalty to another hotel group, but this stay has persuaded me otherwise!",5,0.9416
We flew SingaporeAir from Newark to Singapore (the longest flight on earth 18.5 hours). And we had a 14 hour layover in Singapore before heading to Vietnam. We stayed at the Crown Plaza airport hotel. Very convenient. We could walk there from the arrivals area. From there we took a 25 minute taxi ride ( we used the Grab app-like Uber) To the city of Singapore and had dinner there and did a little exploring. The hotel was very nice and comfortable and had a great shower. I would highly recommend it for a night or 2. ,5,0.9267

"Just left this property today. i had misconnection flight, therefore SQ gave me a room with meal in this property. The room was alright, with bathtub and shower, rather small for my standard. The bed was comfortable enough. The dinner buffet was great, many options to choose.  The reason I gave 4 star, is because of this one receptionist. A lady with the sourest face I’ve seen. She should not be put in the front desk in my opinion. She did not even smile, and she cut me while I was trying to explain to her regarding my stay. Very impolite. I stayed quite the whole time until I could not hold myself and told her to smile a bit, because I did not feel welcome there. Because of her behavior, my trip was ended badly, such a bad memory.  Luckily there was this other receptionist,",4,-0.5563

Props to the Crowne Plaza Changi airport for providing us with an amazing experience. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone! ",5,0.975
We found that the experience of  arriving here about 9 p.m. on Christmas Eve was a positive one.

"Had a 1 night stay with great expectations.  Unfortunately we were disappointed with our stay.  Positives:  Very convenient location.  Staff super friendly and helpful from check in to check out.   Negatives:  Hotel room felt more like a Holiday Inn, than a luxury hotel.  The bed was hard and the pillows were so uncomfortable.  My partner woke up with a stiff neck for days.  Not a great way to start the holiday.  Pool area was dirty, this was at 7am, even though someone was cleaning it the whole time we were there, used bandaids on the ground.  Just gross.  Even though the pool area itself is amazing.  The other negative is ordering a deluxe tea for $11 and getting supermarket tea with powered milk.  No problems with charging $11, but it wasn’t drinkable, surely it’s not hard to",3,0.8482

The walk from the terminal was a breeze.  The airport is very easy to negotiate even after a 19 hour flight.    I had a beautiful room overlooking the pool.  Bed and linens were wonderful.   The decor was modern and elegant.  The room was clean and efficient.   Plenty of water for drinking and the coffee pot.  I was surprised that an airport hotel could be this nice.  Check in was pleasant even though it was quite busy. The bellman walked around offering water.  I was offered an upgrade for my status and loved the room.  The ambience in the hotel was so tranquil.  I felt like I was in a resort somewhere.   The only disappointment was the food in Bar 75.  The chicken satay was all fat.  No one asked why I didn't eat it.

The hotel is very conveniently located to the airport and easy to find, we arrived in the evening exhausted and just wanting to shower and go to bed. The check in process seemed to take a while which surprised me, I had prebooked and at most hotels that we stay at, check in is very fast.

The toilets were huge, well appointed with good quality toiletries. There was a long bath and a shower. We used only the shower which could do with some improvements such as installation of a grab bar and stronger water pressure.   The buffet breakfast was very good.

"Without question this is one of the best airport hotels in the world. As a regular visitor we often stay here for a day or so in transit because Changi Airport has so much to do and the hotel is literally on the doorstep of the hotel.   While it is attached to the hotel unlike the other airport hotels in Changi you do have to clear immigration and customs to get there, but Changi is super efficient and this process is quick - once you're through you simply turn left and the hotel is right there without leaving the building.

This is a very good hotel. Situated within the airport terminal it was very easy to get to. Our room was very large and comfortable. Check in was a bit slow despite it not being that busy though. We were given a discount off food and drink as we are IHG members which was a bonus. We had a drink in the bar and then dinner in the restaurant which was good albeit the drinks were quite expensive. We were able to keep our room a little longer as we had a late departing onward flight. If you don’t want to eat or drink in the hotel it is very easy to get in to the airport terminal where there were plenty of places to eat and drink. Nice pool area to relax in as well,4,0.9797
"An amazingly convenient hotel. The entrance is adjacent the Jewel complex. They’re open 24hrs, matching the airport’s hours. Rooms are newly constructed, everything is clean, all basics and more are provided for.   The hotel’s breakfast: too much variety for one sitting, you’d have to extend your stay or be a frequent guest.  The swimming pool was amazing. There is a view on to the airport so you can see the planes taking off. There are stationary hydro bikes in the pool (no jokes). Little palm islands provide some privacy and make the place interesting.   Expect warm Singaporean hospitality throughout.   ",5,0.9231

The decor for Xmas was also lovely and festive. My only slight con would be that light sleepers should not book a runway view room. We loved our runway room however and would happily book again!

We were rather disappointed with the selection, comprising of 3 plates, they were mainly desserts that were cloyingly sweet.

This was a natural choice for a 22hr stopover. Nice decorated new room in the jewel wing but the dark brown color makes the room look small and not as new as its true age. Bed was very comfortable but bad shower. Weak water pressure rendered the rain shower useless. Even the handheld shower was a pain due to the bad pressure which caused the water temperature to oscillate between too hot and too cold nonstop. Wonder if a lower floor room would be better.

Rooms weren’t available which was fine, but we did payment etc, reconfirmed twin beds and were told that housekeeping would be contacted to prioritise it.   On returning at 8:00 the room was not ready, we were asked if a king bed was okay (it wasn’t), and experienced about a 15 minute delay. We were happy to accept an hour extension on the room, we were there explicitly to sleep and shower.
