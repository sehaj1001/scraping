"My partner and I previously visited the Ritz Carlton Millenia in late 2017. We booked this hotel with the expectations of the luxurious hotel rooms displayed on the website. Upon arrival we were welcomed with exceptional service and of  which the hotel rooms displayed the exact expectations. With such an amazing first experience  we could not wait to return. As we were planning a holiday to the Maldives we were assured we would have to stay at least 3 nights, staff were able to arrange our stay with a beautiful Marina Bay View Club Room. The hotel features exquisite dining, spa, gymnasium, pool, conference and art installations. The main outstanding feature of the Ritz Carlton Millenia is their consistently impeccable service throughout the whole hotel.  The club staff create a",5,0.9657
The room is huge and beautiful and located just right acroos the Marina Bay.  The shops and restaurants are walking distance from the hotel. The staff and housekeeping were extra friendly and accommodating!,5,0.8655
"I stayed at the Ritz Carlton Millenia in October 2019.  - Service was exceptional. The check-in process was smooth.  - It was drizzling during the check-in. One of the concierge staff noticed I was carrying a shirt and took a plastic cover to cover the shirt to avoid it getting wet. I was pleasantly surprised by his attentiveness and initiative.   - The pool attendant (I didn't catch his name) was extremely attentive to the needs of the pool users,  - The slight hiccup happened when I had to wait for 45 mins to 1 hour for the room to be ready.   I had previously stayed at the Ritz Carlton and have experienced service standards that were wide. In this recent visit, it was extremely pleasant and I appreciate the good work by the ladies and gentlemen at the hotel.",5,0.9294
"Due to a very early flight, we arrived at the hotel early in the morning, expecting to be told to wait until normal check-in time. Instead, we were welcomed and offered not only an early check-in, but a complimentary upgrade to a suite, which was a great treat. We were checked in by Fabio, who took the time to find out what we hoped to see &amp; do in Singapore and then gave us some insider tips, including writing out a list of local foods he thought we'd enjoy (his best tip: download the Grab app, which is like a version of Uber - efficient, reliable and much cheaper than taxis). The room was really spacious and well-appointed with everything we needed. The views in both directions were breathtaking - the bedroom and lounge overlooked the marina whilst the bathroom overlooked the",5,0.9914
"It was the March school holidays and travelling out of Singapore wasn't an option. Hence we did a staycation in The Ritz Carlton! Upon arrival at the driveway, my family and I were greeted and whisked up to our room for check-in. I was delighted to know that we were given a complimentary upgrade to a premier suite and what's more, a Marina view room! The team at The Ritz Carlton had a tent set up for the kids and it was amazing! This came with kids amenities as well and it kept the kids excited and busy for a few hours!   I'd lunch at the Summer Pavilion and it was amazing! The restaurant was full and the food was fantastic! truly living up to the Michelin standard!   Breakfast at Colony was a little too quiet due to the low occupancy but it was good as there was no need to",5,0.947
Was in town for dinner and brought  my friends to the lounge for evening drinks.    Place was empty  due to the ongoing  covid19 but the staffs still  served with smiles on their faces.   Thanks  to Sharron  and her team for the warm service  for the evening.   Also thanks to Michelle  for her speciality  made mocktail. Refreshing!!!   Not to forget  sandrine  and rudi for keeping the place  running  smoothly.    A great place  as usual to bring my friends to hangout.  ,5,0.9827
"I had very high expectations for Ritz Carlton hotels having stayed in the ones in Osaka and Tokyo.  However I found the Singapore one lacking in service.  At the time of my check in I stood in front of the check in desk with no one acknowledging me.  That was not a good start.  And unlike in Japan where I was warmly welcome, I didn't feel I received a warm greeting at all even considering the difference in culture.  The room wasn't as luxurious as the Ritz in Osaka or Tokyo but it was bigger with big round windows even in the bathroom.  I didn't eat breakfast at the hotel but had coffee and snack in the lobby lounge.  Again the service was not very attentive.  I had trouble getting the waiting staff's attention for water and coffee refills.  The Ritz Carlton Singapore did not",4,-0.4179
"Had lunch with a group of guy friends at Summer Pavilion (one of the hotel's restaurants) on Valentine's Day. Funny, and coincidentally, enough that those of us who had partners were all free, but our wives were working. I've dined at the restaurant a few times now, but I'm still impressed every time I visit. It certainly deserves the Michelin Star which has been awarded to it for a few years now, and I firmly believe it serves the best Cantonese cuisine in all of Singapore. The food is such a satisfying gastronomic experience, and the service is always impeccable. When you do visit, which you definitely should, I recommend ordering a variety of dim sum and also the Peking Duck.",5,0.9867
"Beautiful hotel with great staff, spacious rooms and amazing views. The Chinese michelin starred restaurant was a bit of a let down, but the breakfast buffet more than made up for it. I'm glad I chose Ritz over Marina Bay Sands this time - it will now be my go to in SG.",5,0.886
"I choose to stay here after my vacation from Europe to rejuvenate &amp; celebrate my belated birthday. The reservation staff was kind enough to change my booking date due to cancellation of flight. The hotel earns its five stars with top quality rooms &amp; welcoming staff. Everything about this hotel oozes class from the lobby to the restaurant but most of all it is the seamless attention to detail that differentiate this hotel.   The room is spectacular though dated but very well maintained, clean &amp; spotless. The view is stunning by day &amp; night.  Many thanks to the kind staff of the Ritz Carlton Millenia Singapore for a flawless stay. Thank you Anastasia for the great service &amp; special care. And to the housekeeping team, Cheng Jing &amp; Liu Hui, the special touch &amp; the birthday amenities",5,0.9944
"Went for our staycation on the 11th to 13th March 2020 with our family of 4. Booked a room for the kallang view. I have to say i love the view, even though there is like a expressway but morning sunrise view was breath taking, i couldn't ask for more. We stayed at the 29th floor and the room was beautiful and spacious. The kids and i personally LOVE the bathroom with a view, it's AMAZING! The in room service was wonderful, the staff were very friendly and helpful. The food was nice, my kids loved it. The staffs are so patient and really put in alot of effort to make our stay comfortable as much as possible. I can never praise them enough. When asked for a feedback regarding our stay, I told them that it would be lovely if the room is provided with a bidet. Only thinking it was",5,0.9955
"Im glad that I had chosen to stay at the Ritz Carlton Millenia to celebrate my mothers 81st birthday. A big thank you to Mr. Takahiro Ishibuchi who arranged a suite with a spectacular view of Marine Bay for us and his warmth welcome at the hotel lobby upon our arrival. Impressed by his professionalism.   Thanks Cheng Jing who decorated the suite with a beautiful towel cake with gold coins which really made my mum a surprise. The service at the Club Lounge was also impressive. The staffs were all very warmth, friendly and attentive. My special thanks to Michelle who offered a very personal and attentive service to us.

"Had the opportunity to pop by Ritz Carlton once more, this time for dinner at the Michelin-starred Summer Pavilion. We thoroughly enjoyed the soups, which must have required so much skill and effort to prepare, as it was so full-bodied and did not taste like much/any seasoning had to be added at all. The London duck was so aromatic and moist, it's probably the best thing I'm going to have tasted in 2020. I usually scrape all the fats off duck skin, but I ate every bit of this duck, including the fats and it wasn't greasy at all.   Service, as always, was impeccable. Every visit to Ritz Carlton is like returning home - the service is warm and approachable without being intrusive. Siew Kee, the server assigned to our table, has excellent people skills. She made sure we were our",5,0.9174
"Visited their restaurant Summer Pavilion for a family dinner last weekend. Specially enjoyed the deep fried beancurd with spicy salt, drunken prawns and hor fun - dishes common in Chinese restaurants but done so much better here. The skin of the beancurd was crispy and umami-ish (addictive!). The prawns were needless to say, super fresh, and very good without the need for any sauce. Table side service for the prawns was interesting as we watched the cook Siat Yin deftly flambé the prawns. The hor fun had so much wok hei that my mum and I would be happy to just have kway teow on its own.  Would like to thank our server Siew Kee, for her very attentive and cheerful service. We felt so at ease with her that she felt more like a friend. At one point, we asked her to leave the teapot",5,0.9959
"From start to finish, my experience at the Singapore Ritz was absolutely flawlessly executed.   This property provided one of the highest levels of customer service that I have ever experienced at a Ritz property.   I knew I was in the right place when the staff offered to pack me a ""to go"" breakfast for my flight early next morning.   Almost as important as the service, were the views. Absolutely stunning!  Recommend getting a marina view on a high floor. It's worth it!",5,0.868
"We have sadly just checked out of the Ritz Carlton Millenia Singapore and wow everything about this hotel is perfect, cannot be faulted.  As soon as we stepped on to the property we were treated like royalty and very well looked after Sya who even gave us our first in room check in experience. Sya made us feel so welcome and comfortable and was able to assist us with anything, even when we bumped into him after his shift he was still willing and able to help us with advice for the airport - now that is good service! Every member of the Ritz Carlton were incredible and nothing was too much for them.  We stayed in the room overlooking Marina Bay Sands, and whilst pricey it is worth every cent. The room is huge and so very beautiful. As this was to celebrate our anniversary and my",5,0.9885
"We stayed 4 nights at the Ritz Carlton as part of our honeymoon! It was an incredible experience! All the staff went above and beyond to make our stay a memorable one! Thank you to the housing keeping team Analyn, Lili and Victor for our amazing rose petal bubble bath!! What a dream to walk into! To the colony chef team, Chef Nicolas, and Chef Kelly for spoiling us at the buffet breakfast! So many delicious Delicacies! And an amazing thank you to Lee Lee, Phil and Elenna at colony services!!! Especially Lee Lee!! You made our trip so special!! Thank you so much! We will definitely be back! :)",5,0.9841

"had a overnight layover, and my only regret was not staying longer. Check in was fast, friendly and efficient. room was beautiful with spectacular views of marina Bay and downtown skyline! probably the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in (wish I could have slept in, but early flight). dinner at Colony buffet was OUTSTANDING!! Selection was exceptional!! And Chef Sundar went out of his way to make our dinner even more special with a surprise tasting! Cannot wait to return!",5,0.9707
We stayed here 3years ago and had an amazing experience. We were not disappointed on this return trip.  The room was high 21st floor with fabulous views over to Marina Bay Sands and downtown financial district. The room was very comfortable. We are in the restaurant for breakfasts and some dinners. Huge choice of international food. The staff were fantastic from check in to check out and everything in between.  In summary an outstanding hotel with outstanding staff in a great location,5,0.9853
"I had a chance to be at Ritz SG again. Although there was some miscommunication about my upgraded room but everything went well.  I met a staff, Gee Sing, who escorted me from the limo to the room and a new upgraded room too. He was a nice man, explained everything to me clearly. He was very good.  About the room, i felt that it is dated and hope that Ritz SG will renovate the rooms soon. If the rooms were still in this condition, it couldn’t be compared to newly renovated Raffles or even still new Fullerton Bay.  The buffet at Colony was also great. I could say it was one of the best dinner buffet in town.  See you again next time Ritz SG.  ",5,0.9861
I stayed in the hotel on 15th Feb for my Birthday. The staffs were helpful. Jonathan and Avi(I couldn’t remember the full name) who did the check/in and assisted me to confirm my dinner reservation at Colony. Xing Fu (sorry if I spell it wrong) who was serving at the pool was so kind and great hospitality. In the evening my friend and cousins joined me for dinner at Colony and our table was attended by Hin who took care of us very well. They have given me a surprise for my birthday. Whole experience was amazing.,5,0.9662
"Stayed at the Ritz Carlton Millenia in Singapore for my birthday, it was an absolutely AMAZING stay. The resort itself is so clean, you dont even see the housekeeping carts in the hallways.The housekeeping staff are like little fairies. The staff really went above and beyond to make my birthday really special. On our first day we had Chef Suga make us a special treat for b'fast, on my actual b'day I had the staff bring over a little b'day cake and they sang happy birthday. After returning from a night out, a bottle of wine, more cake and some other sweets were left in our room to continue celebrating.

I had a 3 day scheduled in october 2019. Due to Pasport issues when flying thru Manilla our group was not able to stay in the hotel. We canceled more than 36 hours prior to check in. The Hotel said they have a 48 hour cancelation policy. Looking on line there is NO such policy listed either on The Hotel site or Expedia. The room rate was to be $500 per night. They kept $1008 of my dollars and would not return the money. I have fought with Expedia and the Hotel for 3 months. I am stil out $1008 for a trip that was canceled properly. I would not use this hotel. BE very wary of using this Ritz Carlton hotel.,1,-0.6408
"This was our second visit to Singapore but stayed in Clark Quay last visit, we choose this hotel due to a better location and we were not disappointed. It was easy walking distance to the Singapore Eye, F1 Track, Gardens by the Bay and Marina Bay Sands (hotel and shopping mall) The hotel itself had all the luxuries and service you would expect from the 'Ritz' brand  I can not fault this hotel, everything from the check-in, room, staff, and breakfast were all 5 star and above - highly recommended !",5,0.9505
"If you're looking for an amazing Hotel, with incredible, stunning views, this is the place, it does not disappoint. From the moment we arrived, there's a sense of elegance, everything is so pleasing to the eye. The reception from the initial staff opening up our car door was so warm and welcoming, they took care of everything. At every level of service we encountered, it was of the utmost excellence. The entire staff were so polite, kind and they all seemed to genuinely care for our every need, truly, a wonderful experience.  We stayed in room 1310 and it was fantastic, the views of the bay were breathtaking. The house keeping team of Eric, LiLi, Han, Ian and Analyn were amazing!

"I cant imagine having a more perfect base for a two day one night hustle of Singapore. The Ritz was amazing from start to finish. Service was impeccable. It is right in the heart of Marina Bay and walkable to everything in the area, including the Gardens and the MBS for shopping and such, by just crossing the helix bridge...  We were upgraded upon check in and although I booked a room with a view it was more than I could have imagined. The look out over the city from the corner suite cannot be beat. We also asked for a late check out due to an evening flight and were accomodated. The amenities are very nice, and lucky enough for us we were able to dine at the One Star Michelin ""Summer Pavillion"" which we enjoyed thouroughly. Also the breakfast at Colony was off the charts with",5,0.9535
"Actually visited in Feb 2019 but the service was amazing, location super convenient, and rooms as you would expect above standard. The pool fantastic also. The restaurant very over priced considering you can hop across the road to the hawkers and get the same food for pennies compared to pounds, but a top choice for anyone who wants to stay in a bit of luxury. A short walk from the shopping centres it’s in a great location. I’d recommend anyone going to look out for the electric scooters you can pick up and pay on your mobile for, they’re everywhere and make seeing Singapore a breeze. We used them to go from hawker to hawker lol... the hawker food by the way is nothing to worry about, cleanliness standards are high, so give it a go and dig in!",5,0.9853

Not only was the staff (especially bell hop Kumar and employee Cleo) spectacular and the vicinity immaculate but the location in the city is spectacular.

"Location: I liked the location which is a 8-10 min walk from Marina bay Sands and the gardens. Property: Nicely decorated, not as 'Ritzy' or 'Posh' as other Ritz locations i stayed in. Room: Executive room was spacey and with  nice view. Again, was not as 'Ritzy' or 'Posh' as other Ritz locations i stayed in. Bathroom was great though with a beautiful view. Gym: Perfect, well equipped with great service. Breakfast: At the restaurant was with a huge selection, but found the quality pretty mediocre. Club lounge: Was perfect - with 5 different services throughout the day.

"I have stayed at the Singapore Ritz Carlton on a number of occasions over the last 15 years and it was my 'go to' Hotel in the region. However, I had not been for a couple of years and was slightly disappointed by my latest trip.  The welcome at reception was excellent as ever. Aira made sure that I had a quiet room and also arranged a late check-out for me.  The rooms are large, elegant and everything works well - with a comfortable bed, good lighting, excellent wifi and connectivity as well as great views over the city.

Our first stop was the Chihuly Lounge, adjacent to the lobby where we were recommended a nightcap of the Coco Violet (with lavender syrup, blue curacao, egg white and lime) for sweet and subtle floral tones to welcome us to the property while reception registered us and delivered our keys.

We were disappointed that we were not able to receive BonVoy loyalty points, but were happy that my husband's Platinum Elite status was nevertheless recognized and received an upgraded room.  We selected our hotel primarily on location and BonVoy affiliation and we were very pleased with the location's proximity to Marina Bay.    The breakfast buffet is EXTENSIVE!  Make sure to explore all the offerings in the back rooms.  We'd also like to give extra compliments to Liz Choi and Janice in the Chihuly bar.

I have also dined at their restaurants on many occasions since then throughout the years. This time, even though I was not a hotel guest, I made a call to the Colony Bakery earlier this evening since I wanted to send a gift hamper to my Singaporean friend before I fly out of Singapore tomorrow morning.

To enjoy it’s excellent location, book a room from the Marina side and you won’t be disappointed.  The views are to die for. The rooms are spacious and I really love the minimalist decor, with a touch of classic luxury. The design reminds me of Japanese or Finnish minimalist design.   When booking a Club room, you get to enjoy all typical Lounge benefits. However, Ritz Carlton has taken their  lounge game to another level.

They obliterate any staff I have encountered in my past hotel stacyations and I mean it. I can say this and again that you should book RCS to exeperience their services and although there may be times when service seems not just right for others, I would like to emphasize that it is really their service attitude that sets RCS apart from any 6 star hotel in Singapore.

When we went to pool just to check out, one of the pool staff gave us a little tour and took picture for us. The room was very nice. Great view with MBS and tiny merlion. We booked club room which was great idea. Food at the club lounge was on point. They had different menu everyday. I didn't not have dinner which I'm very much regret. However there was couple issues. You could hear someone begging door and talking the hole way all night long. Also the other night, house keeper came by around midnight and delivered blanket which we didn't not order.

"The Ritz Carlton Millenia Singapore, proved to be an amazing experience even the second time around. I was there on a business trip but extended my trip for shopping and sightseeing as well. It was from December 10-13, 2019. The entire hotel seemed liked a Christmas wonderland, beginning from the huge Christmas tree at the entrance to the several nutcrackers placed in the restaurant and lobby areas. The Christmas goodies on sale were a true delight and I even carried a lot of it back home with me. This time I was booked in a Marina room and the view was breathtaking, the photos don’t do justice on how wonderful the view was at all times. The Ritz by all means is a class apart, they had extensive renovations going on, on some floors but not the slightest hindrance or discomfort",5,0.988

Spa was what you would expect from such a decent place, not the best though. Location was superb. Two tips: First, get the rooms facing the Marina Bay Sands, what a view. Second, avoid the rooms facing the service doors as they can get a bit noisy sometimes.",5,0.8599
Not just a hotel Not just a room Great service We traveled with our 9 year old son and full of atentoons to him. Excellent staff An incredible experience We had a suite with club lounge Very very good,5,0.5964
"We enjoyed every minute of our stay. We were met by a lovely gentleman out the front of the hotel who took us up to the Club Lounge and settled us in.  I’m so disappointed I can’t remember his name.  Unlike us, he remembered our names and had a chat each time we arrived and left the hotel- very impressive. We were checked in early and given a room on the same level as the Club Lounge.  I was concerned that the room might have been a bit noisy as it was directly opposite the lounge.  I am a very light sleeper!  I asked if it was possible to be moved to a quieter area of the hotel.  We were allocated a beautiful room one floor down later that afternoon. It was very quiet, no noise from neighbours or plumbing from other rooms. Bed are very comfortable and linen of a high quality. ",5,0.9064
"This property is incredibly well located and the view from the room is incredibly beautiful. The breakfast buffet may be the best I've ever seen, though I didn't sample the restaurants for other meals. My room was delightful - I could have spent hours gazing out the window at the city. My only complaint was the staff at the front desk who didn't seem able to answer my questions or solve the minor problems I had. Perhaps they were a bit inexperienced and just overwhelmed by the activity of the race week-end, but things didn't get done quickly enough, and some of the requests I made took hours to be honoured. A shame... But I would definitely go back.",5,0.9348
"From the moment you arrive up the winding driveway into the oasis of luxury and sumptuous cuisine that is the Ritz Carlton Singapore, you have a sense of elite comfort. The common areas are busy but the restaurants offer the very best of cuisine, whether it is the Colony Restaurant with its extensive buffet, or the food available in the Club Floor. The rooms are well appointed with lovely toiletries and generous linen. The outlook from the bath is a hexagonal window out onto the marina area. Service is excellent throughout the hotel.

"I stayed almost a week in this beautiful property as my wife, given the nature of her work had to visit the Singapore Office.  The hotel is stunning and very clean. We enjoyed the breakfast room very much. As Europeans we found it somehow extraordinary. It is not only the design and the presentation of the buffets, but the food was delicious - outstanding. I was looking forward to this stay and I convinced my wife to book this particular property. Being a hotelier myself I was looking for nothing more than extraordinary to experience. But what really mattered and wowed us was the kindness and the genuine care the Ladies and Gentlemen displayed every day from the Front Office and Concierge to Spa and Accommodation.

"I stayed in this hotel for my 12 day business trip in Singapore. Where do I start?  My loyalty to the RC brand was not appreciated. First, different staff gave me different responses. An example would be one staff member would say Halal food is unavailable in the resort while another staff says that Halal food is available at the property. After a long day at work I think I deserve a Halal meal in my room when I stay at a luxury hotel rather than having to go outside myself to find a Halal dish. Is this howl you treat your loyal guests?

This was our families first visit to this hotel having stayed frequently at other hotels in the Suntec area of Singapore. Our room was the best that we have enjoyed in this part of singapore and the view from the bathtub each day was amazing as you look over the city. Each day we had an enjoyable breakfast even though the restaurant was busy with it being the holiday season. My wife and daughter also had spa treatments and although the price was expensive they both thoroughly enjoyed the spa experience. Truly the ladies and gentlemen of the Ritz Carlton won us over for future visits to their property in Singapore.,5,0.9794

Great place. Great location from point of view of Marina Bay. The window overlooked the bay and so did the picture window of the magnificent well laid out bathroom. Breakfast encompassed dishes from all Far East countries besides continental and american dishes. Had the opportunity to have their buffet dinner as well  as high tea. Recommend them absolutely.

The staff is very pleasant, very helpful, the service was top notch from everyone. Hakim the concierge was amazing. Together with the lobby floor staff the guest experience was very good. The food was one of the best I have experience in a chain hotel.

Make sure to ask in advance for a room with a bay view.",4,0.9425

We were ready to go to sleep at once so asked him not to bother; however he didn't forget and brought the luggage racks up the next morning at 9:00AM.  Astounding service!

Today, we dined at the Grand Ballroom for the “Breakfast is on us” Christmas gift donation event, and the service was exceptional.

"As regular guests at this hotel in (71 booked stays now) we are always delighted to return to our ‘home from home’ where you will receive service from the heart. This hotel is our favourite in Singapore. The pool area is just fantastic and the best swimming pool we believe we use around the world. The pool staff here are super friendly and if you get to meet Eva, she will reach  out to you with the warmest smile and hug. Eva recognises us every time we visit and treats us like royalty. The effort that has been made for the Christmas period in the hotel is sensational I have taken lots of pictures and my friends around the world cannot believe how amazing the hotel Christmas decorations are. Well done everyone from housekeeping to the waiting team for making us feel so welcome",5,0.9873
