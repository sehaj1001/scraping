I stayed at the hotel for holiday. From 1993 to till now every year's I spend 5-6 times stay in this hotel.  Because I like it's location. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Always had smiles on their faces. Thanks to the friendly and smiling staffs in the restaurant. The room is large and clean. It is very comfortable to stay. Hotel should look at better rates for returning guests. This hotel is my home away from home when I am in Bangkok. Happy to return to this property and now is one of our favourite hotel.,5,0.9883

Stayed in this hotel for 2 days in Dec'19. Best part of this hotel is the remarkable ambiance of the staff (except housekeeping who are more than rude). Food spread is highly impressive both by tasta and variety as if they dont want to miss anything.  Room is comfortable and sound proof but somehow very bare with minimal amenities. Only one revolving chair is provided whereas atleast  a single seat sofa is a must. One side of the room looks completely empty. Lights provided are very dim. bathrooms dont have dental kits and if you request housekeeping for any the rude  reply is that your package doesnt allow for same. I hope they also stop keeping other toileteries. They give only 2 water bottles of 1/2 lit. each and when you request for more then these are chargeable @ 60 baht.,3,0.2189

"This Hotel is situated in sukhumvit 11 area. From Suvarnabhumi airport it will be approximately 35 minutes in car. There is metro service available from the airport to alight at Nana BTS station.This option will take around 1 hour to 1 Hr 30 Mins. Once out of the airport,you can tell the name of the hotel and buy the pass to get on to the car.Pay the amount plus toll charges. Conveniently reach the hotel.  This Hotel is big and the lobby is good as well as its a 4 star category hotel. Mostly flocked by Indian tourists. Check in was quick and they take 1000 Baht as deposit (Which is common in most of the Hotels in Thailand). I feel Rooms are a little smaller(Could have been a little better). Otherwise no issue at all. The guy who left us to the room explained all the controls and",4,0.2878
"I have stayed at this hotel - many years ago.  The reception does not appear to have changed in the last 2 decades.  My double room, had been renovated.  Gone was the tub, and a large shower tray replaced it.  The furniture and fittings were replaced or renovated.  However... the shower temperature was either hot or VERY HOT...  Crazy when you need to cool down after a hot day on the dusty streets.  And there was nowhere to place an opened suitcase.  The space on the floor was too small even for my medium sized bag, and there was no other place to put your open bag.  I ended up placing mine on a small table between to are chairs - not ideal at all since it could not open flat at all anywhere... Since this is an older hotel - the walls are thick so I could not hear any other",3,-0.7228
This hotel is one of the best I have visited.I along with my parents visited during February and were amazed by the decor as well as the service provided by the hotel. The staff is super friendly and courteous. Room service is also excellent. The complimentary breakfast is one of a kind. Overall a very nice experience.,5,0.9861
"Hotel is quite huge has an impressive lobby. Checking in and out was super quick with excellent customer service. I stayed in a deluxe room in the tower wing, and although the room was ok in size, I found it a bit old fashioned.

"I stayed in the more modern Tower section. The reception upgraded me to a larger room since I paid extra for early check in. They also allowed me several hours for late check out.  The room had tea and coffee facilities and a small fridge. Free wifi that worked. The bathroom was very clean as were all the towels and bedsheets.  My plan included a modest buffet breakfast.  There was even a small section for Indian Halal food to cater for the large Indian contingents. Service was very good, in fact my plates disappeared and table was cleaned before I could return with the next course (sometimes finding I had lost the table to someone else!!). The hotel is located in my favourite area of Sukhumvit Soi 11, in a very vibrant part of the city.  Everything is within walking distance,",5,0.8901

Excellent food and facilities. Great location.  Its was good that the conference was also in the same hotel.  Buffet selection was a good mix.  The hotel is near the BTS Nana station. It is near night mrkets.,5,0.9274
"Decent hotel near Nana BTS station.  Lots of places to eat around, specially Indian restaurants.  The whole area is a tourist area, however.  As such, food around is mostly overpriced.    The room itself is decent. We stayed in the main wing, and the rooms are a little bit dated. Cleanliness is only ok.  After making up the room, it's still not as spic and span, as you can see that parts of the floor are still a little dirty or not well cleaned.   Breakfast selection is good.  However, it gets very busy (at least during the time we were there), and there are times where there is a long wait for waffles and eggs to be served on the buffet.  When guests leave the breakfast table, I noticed that the dining placemat wasn't replaced by the staff, but only wiped.  That's rather",3,0.0617

"This hotel is quite large and beautiful, but management is not taking care of a number of issues, which I think can be improved upon. Consequently, I rated it as mediocre. These are the issues I identified at the hotel:  1. WiFi logs you out after about 30 minutes. Consequently, you have to log back in. This is ridiculous! This happened repeatedly.   2. The breakfast manager kept hounding me for 3 days about my friend and I not being identified in rooms with a free breakfast. The 2nd time he did it (again, while I was eating), I told him to not bother me until I had completed my meal. In effect, this screw up should have been immediately taken care of on our first day at the hotel. Instead, this happened for 3 consecutive days.  3.

We stayed at the tower building (as suggested by friends who stayed here earlier) and the room was very specious. We took a twin bed room and booked for 3 adults with breakfast. Reasonably priced during peek season of end of December 2019. We explored many parts of the hotel and found they have so many halls, shops, restaurants, pool, gym, leisure places. But the nightmare was the breakfast time. It was just packed. You will have to hunt for space if you come around 9 AM. The staff were struggling to refill.

To fix the problem, the reception clerk gave us an upgrade. What a pleasant mistake. The room was very comfortable, clean and with good facilities. The hotel is close to the BTS Sky train. The staff are friendly and the breakfast was varied and good. We would recommend the Ambassador Hotel to westerners seeking mid ranged accommodation at a fair price.

"This hotel was booked for me by Unique Tours travel agency. It turned out to be our worst accommodations for the entire 18day trip to Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam.   Upon checking in, we were told that they did not have our king bed room and we would have to stay in a twin room. Once we got to the room, we found it was small, old, dirty, and loud. The hallways smelled of smoke. We could hear our neighbor sneezing and coughing. The beds were hard. We found extensive mildew and hair in the bathroom.  We contacted our tour agency to complain. After 2hours of back-and-forth and waiting in the smokey hotel bar, they were able to ‚Äúfind‚Äù a king bed available.

"When my friend and I were going to the pool at the hotel to relax and take a swim, we were met by loud bird noises and quickly found out why. This hotel has different types of exotic birds caged by the pool area. This is absolutely disgusting. These birds are supposed to be out in the wild and not in small cages where they can barely move around. Seeing this made us sick to our stomachs and ruined our experience at Ambassador Hotel Bangkok. If these poor exotic birds being held captive, by some weird reason, doesn‚Äôt make you rethink visiting this hotel, the loud bird noises will probably make you change your mind about staying here.

The main wing rooms are very very dated and the hallways smell like smoke. We were glad we were only here for 36 hours to get over the jet lag, otherwise we would have been very disappointed with this hotel. When we arrived they said our room was ready and when we got up to the room the door was wide open. We began to freshen up after our 24 hour flight and one of the cleaning staff opened our door without knocking and walked in on us. We never received any apology from management on this.

I had to go back to the lobby to take the new Key and they were not at all feeling the shame for giving such pathetic service After another room was allocated which was horribly stinky, we had a new problem that the Housekeeping Staff door was just opposite which was a nuisance at all times with doors banging, phones ringing continuously early morning Please note that the Luggage from Concierge takes time to arrive and the Concierge people are only helpful I should",1,-0.9569

The place is dirty, unaccommodating, and downright creepy. The bathroom was moldy and broken down. Find someplace else to stay, you will be quite unhappy here.",1,-0.7187
"The location is the best near the station. The facilities of the hotel are old and tried, but I was surprised that there was no toothbrush, shave, indoor slippers, etc. We asked room service to bring it, but we were disappointed that there was no preparation. Breakfast was mainly Chicken and curry and was not many big choice for breakfast.",3,-0.7003
"I unfortunately had the misfortune of staying at this so called 4 star hotel in bangkok from 25th December to 27th December 2019 with my family.The moment we arrived at this hotel there were at least ten different families waiting and only one counter operating at around 2.30 pm,we had booked two standard room and the process took almost one hour,but when I saw the rooms not only they were in desperate need of renovation but my room had a huge generator next to it on 4th floor and house was unbearable. I went back to reception where the staff instead of listening to me kept on screaming stand in queue when I already had spend one hour there earlier.i have never seen such rude hotel staff in my whole life.finally without even checking she simply told me that there is no room",2,-0.3356
"This is my second stay at the Ambassador and I highly recommend it. From the luxurious lobby to the spacious rooms, this is my home away from home. I stayed in the Tower wing in a deluxe room. The room is spacious, clean and is serviced daily. The 3 lifts give quick access to rooms and to lobby. As it‚Äôs December during my stay which is technically winter (although temps around 32 - 34 degrees Celsius) I still found the pool too chilly for a dip however it hasn‚Äôt stopped other guests that I have seen. The pool area is large, clean and is serviced by  a waiter to access refreshments. I must confess I haven‚Äôt used the gym but with a view that over looks the pool area it is inviting to those who want to keep fit during their stay. There are many restaurants however I have only dined",4,0.8719
"I stayed here for a couple of nights in the month of December' 2019. I stayed in an Amtel Suite in the main wing  of the Hotel, which is very old and not well maintained. The room was not up to the mark and the furniture seemed worn out. The property clearly did not match the standards of a 4 star hotel. However, the staff was very courteous. Miss Eve, at the reception, was very polite and cooperative and so was Miss Ravin.",2,0.1336

"Me nd my family had a great time in Ambassodor Hotel in Bangkok. The service was so good,hotel staff's are very friendly. They have room's good quality of toiletries nd room's are very clean too. Overall it's worth for money. All I can say it's excellent Hotel in Bangkok for stay.",5,0.9589
Hotel is in the good location of Sukhumvit area. Hotel it‚Äôs self very huge we got upgrade to superior room with nice view and lovely decoration. Thank so much Ms. hathairat for your kind support and taking care of us during our stay.  Also the spa staff very good and professional .    We will be back again,5,0.9823
I have stayed there for 3 days with my wife and kid. The rooms are ok but if i consider according to price it is over priced. Also staffs can not talk english very well. But as overall the stay is good. I will suggest for people who want to go for shopping can stay here. Sukumbhit 11 is a good place with lot of bars and clubs. Also shopping malls are near. You can take a tuk tuk for around 120 BHT to MBK mall. Hotel is clean but still it looks old on some places.   What i did not like is: They did not allow me to get my family into pool because of the dress code. We as a muslim can not wear those swimsuit while getting into pool.,3,0.914
"Stayed for two days in Dec 2019. The hotel is alright overall for the low room-only price I paid for the basic room with double bed. I was put up in the main tower on floor 7. There are a lot of Indian and Chinese nationals that stay here (solo travellers, groups, and families). There was frequent loud noises and shouting in the 7th floor hallway and the door insulation is poor where one can hear even small talk through to the room. However, this is not the fault of the hotel.   In the toilet I found body hair in the shower and other areas. There is mold in between the tiles in the shower area.   The good things: The room is decent sized for a budget room, with a comfortable bed and couch. There was a balcony in my room with a partial view of skyscrapers and a multi-storey",3,0.6437
"Left a day early due to two main factors:  1. Construction work right next to the hotel, which is still ongoing at 3am!  2. The pandemonium and sheer disorganisation of the breakfast buffet. Staff simply can't meet the volume of guests dining at any one time. This is ridiculous, especially as the buffet runs from 6am- 10am. Trays are constantly empty; there were no glasses for juice both mornings I went down; there's only hot milk for cereal. Considering guests pay extra for the buffet, it's simply horrendous value for money.  The hotel looks impressive on entrance, but once you get to the rooms, you see the age of the place. Furniture, and even mod cons are dated by today's standards.   Fitness centre opens at 9am on weekends, so forget about early workouts before breakfast. ",2,-0.5234
Ambassador is a big hotel. there are many indian restaunt near hotel which is great for me and my family.The room was ok for me. the breaskfast is very good.we eat every day haha.i had a great time in this hotel and thanks for excerllent service from customer relation.,5,0.9231

"Very Centrally located. Close to SkyTrain (BRT)- a 3 min walk. Safe to walk around the area at night for shopping &amp; Dining, &amp; the cafes, pubs &amp; restaurants are all around the area. The area is bustling with activity. Also Terminal 21 Mall is a 15 min walk where Wednesdays are movie days with low price tickets.

"We stayed at banyan tree Bangkok and for our last night had dinner at the  Vertigo restaurant.  Food was amazing and the ambience is fantastic, the view is simply incredible.  Staff go above and beyond to give you the best experience, I have a problem with dairy which was no trouble to the staff, all of my meals were adjusted for me. Our waiter Mie was awesome, took some great pictures for us and even gave us a complimentary professional picture.  I would highly recommend  this restaurant as one of the places to visit and have a fantastic meal before you leave Bangkok.",5,0.9729

"Bathroom drainage has issues. Water logging. Informed hotel staff repeatedly, but they failed to correct. Stayed for 2 days and moved. Hotel has location advantage, near BTS and MRT metro stations. Not good for families.",1,-0.7235
"The hotel is easy to get to as it is only about 400 mtrs from Nana station on the BTS skytrain,the area round the hotel is quite busy,plenty of shops selling tourist items and several 7-11s for food and drinks.We booked a superior room in the tower wing having read some poor reviews of the standard rooms in the main wing and the extra cost was not much.when we arrived we were checked in swiftly and taken straight to our room,You are required to leave a 1000 THB deposit at check in for any extras used,this is refunded on departure when you show your receipt.The room we got was spacious and clean but showing signs of wear,tea and coffee making and two small bottles of water are provided daily.There are three lifts in the tower wing and they are very fast and quiet and activated by",4,0.6059
"Good location and not to noisy. Room was comfortable, clean and tidy. Room service cleaned the room daily and replaced free water and towels. I enjoyed the pool which has changing rooms with showers, pool towels are supplied in the pool area. There's also an aviary next to the pool, with a selection of parrots. I was most impressed with the staff, expecially the reception staff who kept calm, while dealing with extremely rude customers... I had no problems during my stay and would recommend the hotel to others... ",5,0.9434
"We stayed for 3 nights at this hotel, we were upgraded to family room (old Main building) as well because of unavailability of the Double bed... But it comes with smelly room, old furniture. Service was pathetic. We were given inactive keys, for which we have to wait for long time to get this activated.  Otherwise location wise nice hotel, lobby was big and good. We did not opt for Breakfast so wont comment on that. Thanks",3,0.8481
