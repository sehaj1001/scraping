"If you want to be in the heart of the city and close to everything then stay at the Amara Bangkok.  The staff is so friendly and helpful.  The rooms are very clean, the roof top pool gives amazing views of the city and has a bar for drinks if you wish, and the front dest staff are happy to make travel around the city arrangements for you if you need to.  The price is very reasonable for a hotel of this calibre.  Stay at the Amara Bangkok.",5,0.9701
"We loved our stay at Amara Bangkok, we were only in Bangkok for 2 nights on our 2 week trip to Thailand but I wish we stayed longer as Bangkok and Amara was one of the highlights of our trip.  We were welcomed with a refreshing passion fruit drink while we waited to check in.  The room was spotless and very modern, if you can request a room on one of the higher floors for the best view.  The rainfall shower was the best shower ever!  The rooftop pool and bar is INCREDIBLE the views are like nothing I’ve ever seen before. There aren’t many sun beds up there, so if you can get there early!  You are given pool Towels at the bar and the room has robes which most people will wear up to the pool.  We had dinner at around 5pm in on the rooftop and luckily for us we were the only people",5,0.9882
"This was our first time/city in Thailand and Amara was very welcoming. The rooftop pool/bar was our favorite with a happy hour in the afternoon and great views from the pool. It was also open late which was nice for after dinner. There isn't much in the minifridges, but they have a midday happy hour with free drinks and snacks (sushi, fruit, noodles, dessert). There were a lot of options for breakfast and everyone working there was so kind. It is located on a busy street, but the employees were helpful in getting taxis/tracking down grabs. We were there for only 2 nights but enjoyed our stay!",4,0.9881
"Lovely Hotel near 2 Skytrain stations. The Hotel has a  Rooftop bar with a fantastic view over Bangkok and an infinity pool. it‘s the perfect place to start or end the day. The breakfast buffet is fantastic, the personell very friendly and helpful. The beds are compfortable and huge.  The night market is basically around the corner, with the Skytrain you get to MBK and Siam Paragon Shoppingcenters very quickly - but also to the River where you can catch the shuttle boat to Icon Siam. Lumphini Park is within walking distance (European standard!) The city is huge - i recommend a private guided tour to the palace and the numerous temples. I met a very good english speaking guide in Bangkok so i booked 2 tours with her. ",5,0.9673
The free minibar consisted of bottled water and random sodas without a diet soda option. No alcohol. The breakfast benefit was canceled reportedly because of concern for coronavirus so didn’t get that benefit. No diet soda in the club room. The happy hour was nice but I can also just buy my own $2 beer somewhere else.   Hotel is totally fine. The pool has zero shade and few chairs so it’s good for a photo and that’s it. The do not disturb sign is taken as a suggestion which may be a cultural thing but ultimately was very annoying. If I put that up then I don’t want you to knock or ring the odd little door bell the rooms have. Wouldn’t return.,2,0.8592
The hotel is nice but I was more than disappointed as I had booked the club category and was told that there is no breakfast at Club Lounge as advertised. I pay more for a room to get the Club Category but then there is no breakfast and no snacks as advertised. This is very bad and Not Worth booking club category!,2,-0.9645
"Such a great hotel. Staff we’re so friendly and attentive, as soon as we arrived we were offered an upgrade as there were rooms available. The room was clean with a great view. The infinity pool was breathtaking and so peaceful, giving us a taste of luxury amongst the hustle and bustle off Bangkok.",5,0.9755
"Stayed 2 nights in a Club room. Very comfortable bed, room in good condition, good AC.  Good breakfast, ate in main restaurant but went to lounge for coffee/cookies and evening for included drinks and snacks which in fact could make a meal (1 hot option, a few appetizers and some desserts)  Club room had late check out (3 pm) included, very much appreciated before heading to the airport (took taxi meter both ways)  Great service from all staff.  Excellent location in Silom, close to BTS and MRT stations (walking distance in 10 min)  Would recommend without hesitation!",5,0.9826
Great hotel the staff were fantastic could not do enough for us also had a great room would recommend booking the club room would like to make special mention of Golf in the concierge service and Katlar forgive me if spelt wrong she was always very helpful in the club room serving breakfast and drinks in the evening,5,0.9665
"Recently stayed at the Amara. The room was spacious, clean and filled with  amenities on a daily basis. The roof top pool offers spectacular views of the city at night. This was definitely a highlight having a drink or two up there each night. The hotel is within walking distance to the local train station which we opted to use daily instead of the corrupt taxi drivers who became just a nuisance. A five minute walk down the road takes you to the well known Patpong Night Market with some good food options nearby.",4,0.9118
"This hotel is just great for anyone who wishes to visit Bangkok. As I really did not find anything negative I give 5 stars! Here are some positive things worth mentioning:   + spacious clean rooms with stunning views out of big windows (executive room)  + amazing rooftop with lovely pool and insane views (especially at sunset; I would even say that the views outperform those of the more acknowledged Bangkok rooftop bars)  + good location  + fair price/ value for money  + friendly and helpful staff (receptionist, barkeeper, doormen, ...) ",5,0.9885
"The Amara Bangkok is a gem in the heart of Silom. Great location, close to amenities and public transport. The facilities are superb and service is second to none, I highly recommend Club 10 room on the 20th floor",5,0.7829
"Great staff, clean rooms, comfortable bed. We did club level room and was amazing - definitely recommend. Breakfast was great and we loved our stay. Nothing but good things to stay about this hotel and their staff!",5,0.8941
"Beautiful hotel. The room was very clean, beds were comfortable and staff were very welcoming. Buffet breakfast was 10/10, had a large variety of food and the coffee was good. The roof top pool was stunning and a great place to relax and enjoy Bangkok. The cocktails were awesome. Highly recommend, would stay again!! ",5,0.9894
"Hotel has great location, close to BTS skytrain and Patpong nightlife. We had Deluxe twin room at 14th floor. Views were nice, beds and sleeping quality were great. Big shower with good water pressure. Only minus was carpet on the floor in the bedding area, it had spots and wearing out. Pool area was beautiful and afternoon time was no problem to get place for sunbathing and drinks. View is stunning. Also pool was great for little swimming and relaxing.",5,0.9696
"We were on the top 2 floor rooms which are an upgrade, but they include a daily cocktail and hors,d'oeuvrs nightly for several hours plus a wonderful breakfast downstairs, or on an outside deck on the 20th floor offering a lighter breakfast. The rooms are beautiful with a full sized bathtub and separate shower. They even have a Toto toilet with a washlet and a full size glass wall that can open into the bedroom. The rooms have beautifully built in shelves, cupboards, and closets.  A rooftop bar and infinity pool overlooks the skyline views.",5,0.9575
"Modern business hotel. We booked a room with access to the club lounge, so we had breakfast on the terrasse of the 22nd floor with wonderful view, and they serve snacks and drinks in the afternoon for free. We also enjoyed the rooftop bar after long days in the city. The location of the hotel is quite good - not far from the Skytrain Station and Surawong Road seems to be a safe area. Just across the road you have a Somboon Seafood restaurant which we can recommend. Very nice and helpful staff.",5,0.9752
"We booked a club floor room with breakfast included and everything about our stay was perfect. The room, the Club lounge staff and selections and Elements for breakfast. Loved the rooftop pool and the 24 hour fitness center filled the bill for this early riser. ",5,0.8658
"Second time in this hotel, and still good quality. Convenient location, Skytrain within walking distance. Rooms clean and well equipped, breakfast absolutely fine, and very nice rooftop bar with pool. Had dinner one night- good quality and decent priced.",5,0.9298
Location is great since it is walkable to the Patong Night Market and nightlife if you want it. Front desk was helpful in letting us check in early and out late since we had just arrived from a very long plane ride! Complimentary happy hour snacks and drinks have a great vibe and the infinity pool is a great quiet view of Bangkok!,5,0.9738
"We was on a Cruise Ship around the first 2 weeks of January. The Cruise Itinerary included a 2 night Stay in Thailand .   Anybody who's been to Bangkok will tell you that the nearest Port can be 2-2 1/2 Hour Drive each way  so having done this the previous Year  we opted to do an overnight stay.  We booked  the Amaraa  last minute while on the Ship through the Expedia App  It had great reviews and pictures.  It actually exceeded our expectations, from the moment  we arrived ,the staff, the room ,the location and also those incredible views from our room. (Couldn't work out the electric toilet, but it looked impressive) just an Amazing experience.   Thoroughly recommend, great value, great Staff and Services.   You will not be Disappointed.  11/10 . ",5,0.9856
"Amara Bangkok is a perfect destination for business travelers and leisure travelers alike. Conveniently set on Surawong Road, on the edge of the Sathorn and Silom districts, it’s only a few minutes from the city’s financial centers. This luxurious hotel features 250 spacious and comfortable rooms, presenting views of the Bangkok skyline. The on-site restaurants and bars offer a blend of authentic Thai dishes as well as international cuisine.",5,0.8442
"This hotel was amazing, by far one of the best hotels I have stayed in and I would not hesitate to return!  Staff are so friendly, food is lovely, bed is beautifully comfortable! We got free drinks and food from 5-7pm which we weren’t expecting and a minibar which we could also use for free  Great location and gorgeous rooftop pool and bar  My only two (slightly) negative points would be that the sunbeds could do with some cushions as they are a bit uncomfortable without, and the bar drinks are quite expensive ",5,0.9879
Amazing all-comfort luxury room with an amazing panoramic view on Bangkok from the bedroom and from the bathroom. The infinity pool in the terrace is breathtaking and really insta-worthy: we really loved to stay there!,5,0.944
"Stayed 2 nights at Amara Bangkok as our first stop in Thailand Convenient location, clean hotel, good food We opted for a Club room, which was worth it, in my opinion. Club room came with daily breakfast, and evening happy hour with snacks and cocktails. Breakfast spread was extensive and delicious - could order hot food a la carte, or enjoy the buffet which had standard Western breakfast options (eggs, potatoes, meat / cheese, fruit, pastries, coffee, tea), Dim Sum, soup and some hot entrees. Cocktail hour had tons of small appetizers as well. Meals on the club level have a small rooftop bar which was nice to sit at.  Rooftop pool was nice - not huge and not a ton of chairs, but great views and nice to have. Decent gym as well. Room was clean, spacious, with comfortable bed,",4,0.9837
"the stay at Amara Bangkok was good!  The traffic noise was unfortunately still heard on the 11th floor of the hotel!  It was very bad, that for the early check in 2000 Baht per room + breakfast was asked, that is far too much!",4,-0.6333
"Amara Hotel is a place where you can relax with your friends and have fun. The service that they have are excellent, they can speak and able to understand English most especially Khun M and Khun Lew..",5,0.9186
The view was a great place to chill &amp; unwind with friends. The food was delicious and served on time. Sunset view is a perfect time to take a photo in their pool. The staffs was really cool and friendly. The manager Kun M &amp; Kun Lew were very accomodating and hospitable! All of them showed smile to me and my friends. We will definitely go back here soon!!!!😊,5,0.9836
"Beautiful hotel with great service. I will really recommend this hotel to my other friends who will visit Bangkok. Very nice view and very accommodating staff especially the Manager, Khun M and also Khun Lew. Thank you.",5,0.9611
"Stayed here for one night as a stopover. Hotel pool, whilst small and a little cold had amazing views of the city, Unfortunately limited lounge chairs.  Breakfast was nice and had a good selection of items.  Room was spacious and clean. Would return.",4,0.8242
"Hello, in February I will be in bangok and I would like to enjoy your infinity pool that I have seen is spectacular, is it possible to enjoy this service if we do not have a room? Thank you and I await your response.",5,0.8014
"I spent the last Sunday of the year 2019 with my friends and with my great love James in aka aza bar. the view was so amazing and the food was perfectly prepared. I would like give a special thanks to Ms. M ,the manager on duty and khun Lew who took care of us the whole time we spent there at the bar ,they are definitely dedicated staff to serve your guest,thumbs up to this people👍we will definitely come back🙂",5,0.9912
"Been to many hotels and bars around Bangkok but Akaaza bar is far away more spectacular than the rest. Every time I visited Thailand I won’t end a day without eating some Tom Yum and fried chicken and I could say that this hotel serves the best of the best tom yum in Town. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻Of course this experience wouldn’t  be extra special without the glimpse of smile and a world class customer service and hospitality of its people. Kudos to Khun M and her company Khun Lew for the warmth service and care during my stay. These two really radiate very good attitude towards their work by giving excellent service to their clients such a me.🥰 Looking forward to more stay and happy moments with this hotel! Thank you Amara, Thank you Akaaza Bar🥰😍🥂 ",5,0.996
"Was a lovely 4 day stay very welcoming staff and friendly, The hotel we very comfortable and had a lovely rooftop swimming pool with lovely views  Very happy with our stay 😀 Hotel room was big and the bed was nice and comfortable I slept very well the bathroom and shower was very big and easy to use",5,0.9894
The hotel has a good position close plenty of things to do. The rooms are nice and kept well. They are quiet and there is no noise from the other rooms or outside. The staff is helpful and make you feel welcome.  The view from the bar on the roof is amazing and it has a great service. The make good cocktails.,4,0.969
The location is perfect and the room is nice. We booked a executive room with king size bed and the bees is comfortable. We stayed at the 18th floor so got a nice view over the city. The rooftop pool is amazing but the bar is expensive to be Bangkok. A small Beer cost 180bath. The breakfast could have been better but still okey. Friendly and kind staff. Close to everything and easy to get here with either sky train or metro. If breakfast was better and the prices at the rooftop pool/bar was better I would give five of five. ,4,0.9872
The train station is few mins walk or can take hotel Tutuk. There’s an elevator with a ramp to the ground level.   Service is good but the room design is a bit weird. Toilet is next to the door and the bathroom (with bath tub) is at the window so you go to the toilet then walk to the bathroom to wash your hand.  The breakfast is on level 16 but with a flight of stairs up to the pool deck and breakfast area so is not handicap friendly.,3,0.1921
"We stayed for 8 nights at Amara and felt very comfortable. The room was excellent, we liked the large bed, and the roomy cupboard. Staff was kind and helpful, especially the help with taxis and advice on tours was good. Breakfast buffet was very good, and the pool and pool bar on the roof was  special.",5,0.9794
"Very friendly staff, super helpful at every step of the way! The rooftop pool has a great view though can be a bit busy during peak times (afternoon to sunset hours). Nonetheless, a great hotel. Was in the executive rooms and enjoyed the floor-to-ceiling windows as it overlooked the city!",5,0.9734
"The hotel and the staff were excellent.  Clean, helpful, up to date.  The rooftop pool/bar is pretty cool!  The neighborhood, Silom, is probably not a great match for me -- I would've been happier someplace a bit funkier, Silom is a very business-trip / mall shopping area.  Of course, since Bangkok is a destination for shopping, that's my problem.  ",5,0.9081
Great hotel very centrally located to the subway.  They have a tuk tuk service during the day that drops you off at the train station if you don't want to walk. The poo is a little small but doable and so is the gym. It really close to the patpong district within walking distance.,5,0.3483
Beautifully appointed hotel with excellent guest rooms and amenities.  The hotel is nicely located for shopping and attractions.  Very close to the night market.  Easy walk to many restaurants.  The hotel also has a great breakfast buffet.,5,0.9643
"i love the stay over tgere. i had a less time in bangkok neither i stay all my thailand trip in this hotel. its big and amazing. all facilities available also scoozi, 7/11, and many restaurants near this hotel.",4,0.8402
"We stayed at the Amara Hotel for one night before flying on to Bali. On arrival our room was not  ready but we had booked the club 10 room so were taken to the executive lounge to relax and have a coffee.  Our room was perfectly clean and airy. There was a free minibar included in the price but this only contained 3 soft drink cans which were a brand I did not recognise, not the regular soda you would expect i.e. coke, sprite etc. Although in the lounge you could have coke, sprite etc for free so it seems strange not to stock the mini bar with these brands. The infinity pool was beautiful and perfect to catch sunset. We had tapas in the lounge in the evening which was delicious.  We visited Khao San Road in the evening Which was only about 200bhat in a taxi from the hotel. ",5,0.9902
"I just spent 3 nights in this beautiful hotel which is perfectly located to explore the city. I had booked a room on the privileged Club floor which gave me access to the Club lounge on the 20th floor with more privacy for breakfast, free soft drinks and more throughout the day and in the late afternoon free snacks (I would even call them meals), drinks, wine and beer.  The sky bar and the infinity pool are just amazing and the views over the city are breathtaking. Don't miss the daily happy hour from 7pm to 9pm, drink one get two! Throughout the hotel the staff is very friendly, always smiling at you (and happy you do the same :-) ) and very helpful, a special thanks to all of them. If ever back to Bangkok I will be happy staying there again.",5,0.9952
"Excellent hotel, good food, good view from the sky bar, awesome swimming pool on the roof, nice staff, I  can say just good things about this place. If I go to Bangkok again I will repeat this hotel for sure....!",4,0.9617
"We stayed at this hotel for one night before our flight home from Thailand. The staff were very friendly and we want to give a special mention to Reggae, who helped us organise a ride to the Jim Thompson House. His service was our favourite thing about this hotel and it made us feel immediately at home.   The room was modest in size but had all of the amenities we needed. We appreciated that they did not overfill the fridge with minibar items, but left it empty for us to put water bottles in.   The rooftop has excellent views, although we didn't stay for a drink as there was a rainstorm so can't comment on the bar experience.   The breakfast was varied and well-prepared. The waiting staff were friendly and brought fresh coffee to the table.   Both the check-in and check-out were",5,0.9649
"Hotel was comfortable, easy accessible on the train line, and had the best rooftop infinity pool.  We booked a 2 bed room- amenities in the hotel room were great: free water, soft towels, robes, slippers, nice bathroom amenities. Staff was very friendly and helped us download the Grab App so we could get a car back to the airport. Communication in English was easy. Big smiles when we entered the hotel.   The rooftop pool was busy most of the day, and even busier near sunset: cue the instagram influencers taking photo shoots in the amazing infinity pool. The rooftop has an awesome happy hour while enjoying the views of Bangkok. I would definitely stay here again- location is in the business district, so it is very safe. Just lacking restaurants.",5,0.9943
"Excellent hotel , good central location, friendly staff,nice breakfast,Tua from club room services was excellent host and Phim &amp; Pornd from housekeeping were excellent with there advice on shopping &amp; advice for the area &amp; did an AAA cleaning service of our room every day , Thank you really appreciate good service , Highly recommend",5,0.9806
Many thanks to miss MONk staff that work in amara hotel bangkok surawong club lounge.a very friendly.helpful staff that let you feel at home.been a great stay there because of the friendly staff there.as for the breakfast at element it was not good.you can skip it.club room n club 10 is 2 different layout.but the agents that sell amara use the club 10 layout to sell as club room.the room is not same as what hotel.com or other website say it is.suggest amara hotel look into this matter to avoid customer disappointment when they check in.location is far from bts.small gym n small pool.room clean.overall is the friendly staff that work there make you happy and feel warm.thanks to all the staffs there.,4,0.9027
"we had a room in a high floor. (Executive Room) That's why the view was beautiful.  the food was very good, especially the breakfast! also the location was perfect, near to all the attractions. The pool and the rooftop was amazing!!!!  i highly recommend this hotel!",5,0.9556

The view at the pool at absolutely  breathtaking !

Price are very seasonable considering the great locotion and asmosphere.  ,5,0.9793
We stayed for 2 nights (again) at Amara Bangkok in a club room. The privilige to have drinks and snacks between 17.00 and 19.00 is great. Staff is super friendly. Very heplfull and always smiling. The room is good. The bathroom has a toilet with watercleaner. Location is near Silom area so always things to do. ,4,0.9524
"Roof top pool is great and gives a good view of the city. But the price for a drink?? EXPENSIVE. Food? I had a pizza and it was like the ones your get in the suprmarket and heat up in the microwave. Also had pasta and that was supermarket grade food. Only stayed for 1 night, and that was enough. The room was nice and clean, and the staff very helpful, but i wouldnt be going back",3,0.8746
Walking the street of surawong and i see the amara hotel that it seems their is a rooftop bar to chillin and their is!! A very nice ambience of the bar coolest staff a veryhospitable and always smiling to the guest khun M and her staff ms .Lew is very accomodating!cheers!!! I will come again this rooftop bar spot of bangkok soon..,5,0.8053
A group of us stayed at the Amara ain Bangkok and we used the executive club lounge and had the best service from the trainer Nut who made our stay very special and her service was amazing if only there were more people in hotels as good as her we will certainly be staying here again and hope to see Nut and the rest of the lovely people that looked after us,5,0.9719
"We stayed for three nights in two club rooms and overall had a very nice stay. However, on check in we were told we would need to wait until 3 o clock for the rooms however the rooms were still not ready at this time. We had requested for the rooms to be next to eachother in advance but this also wasnt possible. When we got allocated our rooms they smelt really bad abit musty and like something had dried badly so we went down to reception to ask to be changed. This seemed to be very diffcult and was very time consuming to sort out but eventually, one room was changed but we still had one room which smelt bad for all of our stay but we couldnt be bothered with the hassle of the change again.  I would say that the receptionist staff are not very competent.  The rooms were spacious",4,-0.9203
"Not a bad word to say about the place. If you can drag yourself away from the rooftop pool, the Patpong Night Markets is a short walk up the road. Just the place to go if you want to stuff your bag with cheap clothes and useless trinkets.  HINT - try the French Toast from the  all-day breakfast menu",5,-0.1406
"We had a 3 night stay at the Amara, our first trip to Bangkok. The room was a good size and the staff extremely friendly. We loved utilising the roof top pool and bar, it was a really cool place to hang out and have a swim and drink at the end of the day. The buffet breakfast had both Thai and western food on offer. There is a 7Eleven store next door. There is a constant stream of Tuk Tuks out the front and the SkyTrain station is a short walk.",4,0.9319
"This hotel locates at the middle of two BTS stations: Sala Daeng and Chong Nosi. So if your stay in BKK would be relying a lot on BTS, this would be somehow annoying. But if you want to stay a relatively quite location, this may suit you. Staff are very helpful, patient and friendly, providing great information about sightseeing and negotiating a fair price from taxi driver. Room is clean and house keeping service is great. However, the layout of a normal room is kinda strange, with Big bathroom and the small room area. The quality of toiletries is average (Well, I expected a bit better since this is a 4 star hotel). Also, the rooftop pool is small and the food isn’t bad but not great. The price for beverages aren’t cheap (the cappuccino in the pic costed me 140 TBH, which is",3,0.9342
My fiancé and I had the pleasure of staying at Amara for our time in Bangkok and can safely say it was a highlight of our trip.   They have a fantastic rooftop pool which is in the perspective spot to watch the sunset over the city as well as a great buffet breakfast included.   I would also highly recommend booking a club room. Not only are they a lot more spacious but you have free tea and coffee all day as well as cocktails/beer/wine and canapés from 5 o’clock-7 o’clock. ,5,0.9472
"Very nice and clean hotel with a friendly staff and responsible rates. It’s central to all the nightlife, street food, restaurants and attractions in Bangkok. The restaurant in the hotel is also nice.",4,0.9473
"Perfect stay in Bangkok ! Very good hotel with a nice view on the city, lovely by night.  The room was very nice and clean and confortable for two with a large bed. The food in the restaurant was really good and tasty.  I recommend this hotel for couple.",5,0.9757
"My stay was excellent. The staff was very accommodating. I was mostly impressed that the pool area is only accessed by guest and need room card for entry, so many hotels I’ve stayed at, the public are always randomly coming for photo opts and that disturbs guest’s privacy for which they’ve paid for. This hotel will be the only place I’m staying whenever I visit. I was happy to hand over my money. Love the hotel ,Thailand’s people &amp; culture.",5,0.9432
"Stayed here for a week - Location was very accessible Staff very friendly  Loved the roof top pool - used daily Room large and modern and clean Breakfast good, fresh and plentiful Hotel needs a better map to provide the newcomer with how to get around easily - very small and hard to read with no street names",5,0.9572
"We stayed for three nights in August. We had booked a Club room but when we checked in we were advised these were full so we had been given Club 10’ room. This is the same as a club room but has a bath tub in the window, it was fab. The extras you get with a club room are well worth it, late check out , use of the club lounge which offers free beer, wine, cocktails 5-7 along with canapés , soft drinks, tea, coffee etc. The location of the hotel is great for sightseeing , close to a couple of BTS stations which take you to the pier in a couple of minutes or in the other direction to downtown Bangkok. We used these a lot they are really cheap and there every couple of minutes. You can walk to Patpong night market (which is not really anything special unless you want to see the",5,0.9542
"Like a battery that needs to be recharged, after such an intensive 1 week training, I decided to move to another area in Bangkok, closer to a lot of nice restaurants and spas. Detox was     the only word I can think of which gave me enough reason to splurge on treatments and spas which is known in Bangkok.   The hotel is located along Surawong, not as busy and congested like Sukumvit and quiet, walking distance to a lot of small restaurants, coffee shops and spas. The Club Room 10 interior of the 24th floor is quite modern, simple but nicely layouted. Nice bathroom with bathtub and big closet with a safe, overlooking the Bangkok Skyline. The room got enough outlets and lights on the desk where you can work when you  have to and reading lights are just perfect when you want to",4,0.9694
"Nothing but good things to say about my stay.   As a solo traveller I was made to immediately feel welcome by the staff who were always helpful and polite whenever I needed them - whether it was to grab a pen, ask them to store my bags on checkout day or to organise a taxi to the airport. Nothing was too much hassle.  The room I was in was lovely, spacious and had great views of the city and has all the usual home comforts (coffee, safe, ironing board etc) that you'd want from a modern hotel. Complimentary wi-fi is provided and is very reliable.   The Rooftop is well worth a visit.Spectacular views of the city and a lovely infinity pool (open until 8pm) so you can swim and enjoy the views too. There's a rooftop bar up there as well which is open until 1am and pretty well priced.",5,0.9951
"Amara Bangkok is a beautiful hotel the service is amazing, especially in the club lounge when Monk is working! she is a beautiful lady and is honestly the nicest person in Thailand. If you choose to stay at the Amara Hotel make sure you speak to her. Thank you Monk! ",5,0.9725
"They only gave us one card for the room. When boarding the pool I did not have a card to be able to get off in the elevator to my room. They forced me to go down with the wet suit and without a shirt to the hotel reception for a copy. Neither in b &amp; b with a pool have these things happened to me. Fatal in the deal and it was a very embarrassing situation.  the staff of the pool (a girl) in the afternoon had a shameful behavior  On the other hand, the cleanliness of the room leaves much to be desired, stains all over the floor. It lacks maintenance. The only good views are from the pool but there are many more hotels as well in the area.",1,0.0898

The hotel is very well located within walking distance from major shopping centers including Central World which is accessible through the skywalk.  We found the hotel neat and on the ball in all respects except the coordination of their elevators. At times we found ourselves waiting upwards of 10minutes even though there are at least seven vehicles.  The rooms were neat and of par Standard to what I'd expect from a four star hotel.  The breakfast spread was varied and impressive and we enjoyed it very much. Had a good time in Bangkok and being based in Amara made it easier to access many amenities which I am not sure would have been as accessible from elsewhere.,4,0.9652
"While exploring Thailand, me and the girls spent 2 nights at the Amara hotel in Bangkok. The hotel is definitely luxurious. We absolutely loved the infinity pool with the bar. We would relax and revive with a fabulous fruit smoothie in the day. We ate breakfast at the buffet which was delicious they had a range of different types of food to suit everyone’s taste. The staff where very helpful when we where leaving the resort to explore Bangkok they would always arrange tut-tut or taxi with a negotiated Thai  price which was very lovely of them. We visited the night market , the marble temple, day market we also had a Thai massage treated ourselves to a mani and pedi whilst In Bangkok A’s was super cheap comparing to London definitely recommend. Only thing we would say was when we",4,0.9878
"Amara is perfectly situated with one of the best views towards the King Power skyscraper.  You can get to great restaurants, such as Le Du (7mins walk), Eat Me (15mins walk) or Blue Elephant (15mins ride), in a short time. If you are interested in night markets the Patpong Night Market is just a 5 mins walk away. We stayed in the Club10 room, which had access to the Amara lounge included. In the lounge you can enjoy a quiet breakfast in the morning and a drink or two with some snacks in the evening. Albeit the options for breakfast are not as plentiful as for the Buffet Breakfast. The staff is super nice and very helpful. One day when we went out to explore the city, we forgot the water in our room and the staff was so nice to give us 2 new bottles. At the last day after",5,0.9848
"We are checking out from Amara today and again I’m very happy with our stay here. I’ve been staying here four times now. That means I’m more than satisfied with this hotel. Amara is practically situated and has everything needed and even more.   Especially I can recommend the club room standard which gives access to the Club Lounge. The food there is good for the eyes as well for the mouth and stomach 😊.   In the Club Lounge two very friendly and excellent people are doing a great job with the best service for the guests. They are so friendly and nicely charming. Their names are Monk and Noon. The hotel can be happy to have them, as they had Jah working here earlier. It seems good leaders create good coworkers.   I wish Amara all the best and God’s blessings. ",5,0.9963
This was my 4th visit to the Amara Bangkok and just as in previous visits I found the hotel staff to be very helpful and courteous in all of my interactions with them. Rooms are modern and well equipped. If you like the Silom area of Bangkok then the Amara Bangkok is an excellent choice.,5,0.932

"We stayed 2 nights over the King's coronation weekend, very helpful staff advising us what we could sightsee as a lot of tourist places were closed.

"Love amara bangkok for its service, cleanliness and spacious room!  Location is near silom area, not your usual pratunam busy area but Amara bangkok is a 5 mins cheap grab ride away from MBK/ Siam Square. Right next to a 7-11 and a 3-4 minutes walk down the street u’ll find many massage places and supper choices from many pushcarts food vendors! Hotel breakfast spread was decent but good to have opted in when you book because there isnt much breakfast choices near the hotel in the morning.  Hotel staff were all polite and could speak fluent english.  I’d book it again! Totally enjoyed our stay there.",5,0.9219

"I was here last May 3-5. I didn’t expect too much since I only needed a place to sleep and  I would be out most of the time. The moment I arrived, the people at the reception were very accommodating and helpful in all my inquiries. They took time and went above and beyond every time I asked directions. When I arrived, It was around past 7 pm, I think but really wanted to experience riding the tuktuk that night since I only have a full 2 days there and with already packed schedule. They found one for me and explained to the driver the areas I wanted to go and see. The tuktuk they got me looks pretty awesome and more modern looking than the ones I see on the street. I was satisfied.  I’m not even done yet. How about that rooftop pool? Soaking in the pool overlooking the city.  The",5,0.9492
"Had reserved a club room (20th floor). The floor was quiet &amp; had a nice balcony and lounge area with some refreshments. The happy hour time (from 5 to 7 pm) wine, beer, soft drinks and a good variety of appetizers and a couple of hot meals are available for free. Also club breakfast was available. Perfect. Rooms were clean; wifi and air condition worked perfectly. Water had good pressure and the toilet seat was fun with different kind of functions. :) Three elevators were fast. Pool area too small, still better than no pool. Great views from infinity pool. Concierge helped us with restaurants, transports, golf reservations etc.  One day we were informed that there would be total electricity blackout for four hours and that the elevators would not work for one hour.

"The Amara was a great hotel to stay at, facilities, rooms and service all excellent and good value for money in a good central location. Would return on future trips to Bangkok. Only suggestion is there is some information on their website out of date (for instance using the hotels local transfer service) which needs an update, otherwise great stay and location and would suggest investing in the club levels as the club lounge is a nice additional touch.

Good place. I would recommend! the room is a little bit small but it is okay. The bar is nice and the view from the swimming pool is cool. The staffs are lovely and polite! they are also helpful and have a good service mind. Food is delicious,5,0.985
"We arrived at this hotel early in the afternoon after landing from DXB. Unfortunately our luggage didn't reach us until midnight. The hotel were great at arranging toiletries etc. so thank you very much for that.  We had upgraded to a Club Room, with the bath by the window like you can see on their website and it was fantastic. The room was well laid out and very comfortable. The Lounge access is good (though there really should be toilet facilities on the Lounge Floor). The 2 laundry items a day is great as is the complimentary mini bar.   The staff are a credit to the hotel and made everything really easy from check in to check out. Of course the roof-top pool is a must for the photo opportunity it provides, and the view is incredible. The pool service is good too, with a wide",4,0.9891

"First time in Bangkok - solo traveller with mobility disability. I requested a special disability room by email. From the moment of my email, the service was excellent and the staff were really amazing during my stay!   I enjoyed the room type (very safe with loads of space), the staff were all extremely friendly and helpful, the hotel's restaurant was great, the roof-top pool was the best I've ever seen (not only was the view ""to die for,"" but it was scrupulously clean and well staffed), the convenient and central location and overall, the hotel was great value. There were absolutely no negative points.",5,0.9655

This hotel delivered, beautiful rooftop pool, friendly staff, great breakfast, and a wonderfully comfortable room and bed on 16th floor with wonderful views. I wish I could have stayed longer, if I’m ever in Bangkok again this will be my number one choice. Fantastic.",5,0.9829
"This is a rather new property in Bangkok, with a superp location, large and wel equipped rooms and a fantastic rooftop pool area.   However - there a few drawbacks.   First of all, i hardly never had any hot water in my shower. Most days the water just stayed cold nomatter how long I kept it running, while it got warm a few times after running for more than 15 minutes. I cannot imagine how much water is being wasted with more than 200 rooms letting the water run to get a hot shower.   Second, the hotel is very fairly priced, but that also means it attracts a crowd of people, that I normally find annoying (you all know the kind of trashy people who brings their own loudspeaker to the poolarea and speaks down to the staff).   Third, be aware that the amazing infinitypool a is a",3,0.7814

Rooftop pool not the largest yet wonderful and able to just stand and watch Bangkok go past from within the pool marvellous. Able to have breakfast in club room on 20th floor however chose to use main dining room and quality and service excellent. Booked limo pick up and drop off from airport, this was yet a gain perfect, Joe the concierge offered again excellent service together with all staff helpful and welcoming.

"The Amara is centrally located with main sights (the main park, Jim Thompson's house, red light district, Siam Square, river hub for temple of dawn etc) all walkable. It is a few minutes walk from a night market but quite a disappointing market (not high quality goods or street food but t-shirts, fake brands etc).  The hotel is modern, with high quality sheets, rain showers, large baths and good views. The sound proofing however is poor. We could hear next door - from unzipping a suitcase to their TV. It was a connecting room. We also woke up twice at 5am due to loud pipes. We changed rooms on our last day.  We chose a club room. We chose this as you get a free mini bar plus access to the club room. It is still advertised as complimentary cocktails. This is not the case. We",3,-0.2238

The Amara in Bangkok is by far one of the best hotels you can stay in when visiting the city! I totally recommend upgrading to their club rooms which gives you 24/7 gym access and offers a lot of extra's in their club lounge (think extra food &amp; free drinks)! The room was very clean and even had a bathtub overlooking the city! It's the perfect place to unwind after a busy day of templehopping around Bangkok,5,0.9575
"We loved the position of this hotel, a short Tuk Tuk ride to the river,walking distance to Patpong market,Tuk Tuk ride to Lumpini park.lovely roof top swimming pool. We stayed in club rooms which were fabulous, gave access to happy two hours of canapés and drinks and choice of breakfast venues. Breakfast excellent. Free bottled water, 2 beers and soft drink in fridge. We stayed for two nights en route to Australia.reception staff very helpful and will change large notes into smaller ones.  No need to get Thai batts in uk as you get much better exchange rate in Thailand either at airport or at exchange booth, there's one just down the road from this hotel ( remember to take passport with you!) Similarly either spend your batts or change them back at the airport for best exchange",5,0.9819
"I loved Amara bangkok it is everything a modern city hotel should be. Book a Club 10 room, the room is super cool, well decorated, amazing bed and bathtub with incredible views of the city, with this room you’ll get access to the club (soft drinks, juices, coffee and tea all day, and a “happy hour” where you can have alcoholic drinks and a food buffet between 5 and 7pm), plus your minibar in complimentary, you have free laundry (2 pieces a day), etc. The gym on the 22nd floor is well equiped with high-end equipement.

Breakfast was super tasty with many options for all tastes!",5,0.9814
"We booked room 2010- it featured the bathtub with the city view of Bangkok.  It was beautiful for a couple's getaway. We liked the softness of the beds, and the water pressure of the shower.    We booked this hotel mostly for the amazing infinity fool which did not dissapoint, we got some instagram worthy photos there and made some friends. :) The bar service in the pool was good too, I enjoyed their bubble tea.  I like how the hotel was near Patpong night market, 7/11 and near the sky rail.   I would recommend this to others",5,0.9766
"From the check-in to the check-out the experiencia was excellent. They spoke perfect english making very easy any process. Rooms were comfortable, previously provided for the number of guests (water, and bathroom accessories). The hotel provided free bottled water for guests, no limit. It's an excellent plus if you consider the temperature of Bangkok and that drinking water from the system is not recommended for foreign people. The hotel has gym with a great view to the city and a swimming pool (borderless) in the last floor with a bar (consider using the only elevator that takes you there). They provide a robe for every guest in the room. The breakfast is international kitchen so you will find almost everything. Almost 500 meters from the hotel you have a very popular market",5,0.979

The air conditioning did not work and when I returned after dinner, from the front desk sent someone to fix the fault. Even the minibar was not cold, but they said it works like that. The spacious room with a large bed and a view was nice. The not very large pool has a beautiful view, the sun chairs are aged and there are often children who do diving, not much relax.

The rooftop pool is a great palce to gather and the bar has a very nice happy hour.  Breakfast was excellent, save for the coffee, with a nice selection of western and eastern delights.

The hotel is spotless and well maintained, rooftop pool still as stunning as ever, rooms super comfy and of course the staff are unbelievably friendly!!

The rooftop pool is awesome, never seen anything like it. All the staff is very friendly, caring, and helpful! It was my first time in Thailand and the hotel staff gave me great ideas for things to do! They would tell me what average tuk tuk or taxi fares would be around the city to certain destinations so I knew what to expect what was a fair price. The little things that locals do, gotta love it!

Its a cheap alternative compared to other 5star hotels around. Thats something you have to know.   + Comfy beds Clean hotel and rooms Nice rooftop bar with cozy music Good location Friendly service  - The food could defenitly be improved.  The breakfast buffet is ok with a big variety but the food taste is more moderate. We ordered a chef salad to our room wich was just amazing - 5 star quality nothing to complain so we thought we spend a cozy night in the hotel and ordered then other food at dinner time. Sadly we were very dissapointed the quality was even worse of the breakfast and we dont understand how the quality changes so extreme from perfect to moderate.... I think its worth for a better service and better food to pay the extra money and go to a „real“ 5 star hotel,3,0.97
