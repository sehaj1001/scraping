Great location. Novotel Siam Square is always my most favorite hotel in Bangkok. Very convenient to connect through Bangkok's destination. Easy for shopping also you can experience with all highlight restaurant especially White flowers restaurant; Thai local food. This is the best Thai food for me. So I can said this hotel is valuable price good location and great service,5,0.9798
"I have stayed at this hotel for my annual trip to Bangkok for FIVE straight years, simply because it ticks every box for me. First: it is smack in Siam Square, which is bright and busy and safe; with ample restaurant and shopping options; and a hop and a skip from the Siam BTS Station -- with links to practically the entire city. Second: the staff are just lovely. ALL the staff, from concierge to restaurant to tour serviced to housekeeping -- every single one will bend over backwards to help you. I have turned up way before check-in time, departed way after check-out time, and if a room is not available they always provide somewhere to shower/freshen up; and the lobby sitting area is wonderfully comfortable, with isolated cosy spots that allow comfort and privacy. The rooms are",5,0.9705
"I arrived at Novotel Siam Sq on 13 Mar 2020 for a short getaway with my family of 3. We were served by Ms Gift who was polite and competent. Though the usual chk-in time is 2pm, she swiftly settled our check-in at 10am. We didn't have to loiter around the hotel area and could freshen up before we went for early lunch.  Another special mention was the touch of empathy on their customers. We were supposed to leave on 18 Mar 2020 but due to the border restrictions imposed by my home country due to the covid-19 outbreak, we had to shorten our vacation and leave 2 days earlier than scheduled. The concierge helped us to contact the airlines and tried their best to resolve the matter. Though their attempts were unsuccessful, I appreciate their gd efforts.   Just before we left for the",5,0.9306
We were warmly greeted by their friendly staff by the name of Gift and she kindly upgraded our room. Check in was swift and location is right at the heart of Siam square area. What a nice surprise and thank you!,5,0.9665

"I was extremely delighted with my last week stay in Novotel Siam Square.  From the concierge staff, to the receptionists and the house-keeping team, they offered heart-felt and attentive services with professionalism. To my very pleasant surprise, my room was well decorated with welcoming kits and message in appreciation of my loyalty. I am particularly impressed with the hand written welcoming card with elephant drawing, not forgetting the beautiful painting of Siamese mermaid on the mirror. The room was maintained at exceptional conditions and fresh with a bouquet of fresh flowers that made my day. Because of these extra miles effort in elevating my enjoyable experience staying in Novotel Siam Square, no doubt I shall keep coming back to this fabulous hotel - thanks and kudos",5,0.9904
"Novotel on Siam Square was a convenient location, centralized, having BTS and OneSiam Shopping Malls all within walking distance. The room and bedding were exceptionally clean. Bell staff was very helpful from helping with luggage to booking a taxi to the airport. Front Desk staff was professional and knowledgeable, making checking-in and checking-out a breeze. The hotel's breakfast was simple, great for a quick bite, but more flavorful foods can be found elsewhere. I made the reservation last minute and perhaps it was why the view from the room was not great. Overall, wonderful hotel with great service. Don't stay in rooms ending in 08, they face anugly wall, with half a view of Bangkok's skyline.",4,0.9396
"This hotel has a very cool lobby! Check out the swings in the lounge area....Breakfast was not included and pricey, but the best we had on our entire trip. The rooms are stylish and very updated , that being said they aren't huge. The location is near the skytrain and all the mega malls.",5,0.7673
"I have stay in this hotel at least once every 2 mths for the past decade. The location is perfect with a BTS interchange, the hotel went through a decent retrofit and the staffs are great. AND Mr BEN, the manager, is exemplary. He hold impeccable service and it people like him that make a hotel stay awesome!",5,0.9402
"The hotel was very kind to have my room complimentarily upgraded to a deluxe room. The room was newly renovated and clean unlike all the bad reviews that I have read before my stay. The hotel location is superb as it was stone throw away from everything you need.   Most importantly, the front desk agent, Poh, shown an exemplary customer service. She was very helpful and cheery while doing our check-in and check-out.",5,0.9598
"Despite being absent for over a year I was welcomed as a friend with many staff remembering my name! Kuhn Fon, Mam, Vi and so many others are a credit to the hotel. Great rooms fabulous location - would thoroughly recommend",5,0.9571
Stayed 3 nights here. Good location as near Siam Paragon Mall. Rooms were clean but somewhat dated with old murals on walls. Breakfast breakfast buffet was fine and it came with room. Went to the Gormet bar to order a made to order sandwich which they advertise on the menu wall. Two times I was told I could not have made to order but choose one of two premise ones that looked old and did not have the ingredients I was wanting. Walked away both times disappointed. Don't advertise it if you can't deliver it.  Other than that it was ok. Staff helpful. ,3,0.7469
"Front desk staffs Ms Tok Tak and manager Toey were very kind and help me out with my very early morning check in. Thanks a lot for your hospitality.   The room is spacious, hotel well located near train station and shopping malls.  ",5,0.8923
Very good hotel with amazing service great people just like the pictures and right in the center of everything with 4 minutes to Siam paragon mall and beautiful pool gym and spa and has a great view .,5,0.9705
"Hotel was in a very good location; walking distance to lots of shopping malls. Starbucks and 7-11 just across the street. Lots of foot massage places available; fruit stand nearby. Hotel said it was newly renovated but already felt tired.  Minimalist and simple hotel room.   Honestly, breakfast was disappointing for the price and Bangkok expectation were high- was simply not met.  Furniture was very bulky so it was tight walking to the buffet.  Not very enjoyable. All in all, great location and good nights sleep. ",4,0.6653
"Near shops and restaurants but inconsistent services as I did not get face and hand towels the second day and limited amenities.. like ironing board, iron and apparently there were no room service, a little surprised if you need some late night snacks..    At 15 floor, there were loud noises from mid night to 4-5 am as well as unusual loud noises outside the room at early morning.. sleeps were really deprived.. made it hard for early meetings.

"Warm welcome upon arrival at the hotel and Ms.Gift, the receptionist was excellent and helpful on advising us on the locations nearby. Our stay was fantastic and we will definitely come back again. Hotel is at a strategic location and very convinient to move around by foot",5,0.9493

"My partner and I celebrated our anniversary in BKK and we decided to choose this hotel due to the good reviews and location. Needless to say, we were not disappointed. Front desk staff were friendly and welcoming. They never fail to greet us with warm smiles whenever we return to the hotel. they helped us with our itinerary and on the last day, they helped us book our ride to the airport which saved us quite a bit of money. Would definitely choose this hotel if I decide to visit Bangkok again. ",5,0.9767

"Wonderful location, only a couple of minutes walk away from so many fantastic shopping places, and surrounded by so many good eateries and massage places.  The service here is also excellent. Tizz at the reception was exceptionally helpful in making arrangements to suit the needs of our stay. It is such service you find at novotel that keeps you coming back, holiday after holiday, year after year.  My mother and I thoroughly enjoyed our trip, and we'll be back again soon!",5,0.9795
Great location it just located across Siam Paragon. You can enjoy food no matter local or international around the same area. Pool is nice. However the room is not as expected and we need to clean my room ourselves as the carpet has too much dust. Lastly I have to say thanks for the reception because my booked car didn't come but I was hurrying to airport. Their reception provided me their car immediately. Much appreciated!,3,0.9108
"The location is unbeatable, step out into Siam Square with Siam paragon , Siam BTS , a bit more to mbk , central world and platinum. Food massage shopping all surrounding the hotel for all pockets. Add to this the amazing butler- like service of Tizz, who really dedicated his time and kind attention to my mother, sister and myself, addressing all our needs with the best solutions he can come up with, making us feel so special ! Tizz is a real gem in the service sector , and I am really happy to be served by him. He is quick witted and earnest in devising the solutions, saving me much time and money, really grateful to him ! Would also like to thank the other staff at the front desk, luggage counter and security desk at the entrance of Novotel, they always greet us with a smile",5,0.9925

"The staff was wonderful upon check in and during our stay.  Upon Checkin we were assisted by Joy and Toktak, both were delightful. They were able to assist with early check in and late check out in one of our rooms. I love the location of the hotel. Its perfect to get to and from shopping and Skytrain. We will definitely stay there again.",5,0.9716
"the plus its in a good location. the cons are the hotel needs a renovation. the reception area is dark, the lifts needs painting and the furnishings needs replacing in the rooms. It could be a great hotel but they need to spend money on the hotel and facilities",3,0.5423

"Just check into the hotel and was presented with an amazing service from front desk service officer, Tizz. From taking our details to answering our request and the extra step of providing more perks to our stay.

"I stayed 2 nights at Novotel Bangkok on Siam Square. The location was conveniently next to Siam BTS station and in the middle of the shopping/restaurant district, making it one of the most central hotel location within Bangkok.  The hospitality was outstanding, from Ms Tok Tak and Nynn who checked me in, to the lobby bar team (with live band) that was polite and patient even with my late drink orders.  The rooms were clean and well kept.  An established hotel of high standards and excellent location, a preferred accommodation option at Bangkok. Thank you and see you again :)",5,0.9524
We stay just one night and we came early in the morning surprisingly we got warm welcome from friendly staff named TIZZ. He arranged everything perfectly for us. We can get the room within 15 minutes despite in the very early morning. He has a good service mind and good manner. Politely speaking is his outstanding charisma.  We did not expect such impressive welcome because we thought Novotel may prefer Chinese or foreigner than Thais but we totally wrong.  Novotel will become first in mind when we choose next stay.

"Excellent service from the hotel reception team of Gift, Bow and Soft. It's Chinese New Year peak period at this popular hotel but the 3 of them were very patient and try their best to fulfil my peculiar room requirements, and always with a smile.  With such service, I'm already a satisfied and happy guest, not to mention they managed to find a suitable room.  Such service level is befitting of a 5 star hotel.  Good start to my holiday. Great thanks to these ladies. ",5,0.9923
"I always stay at novotel at siam square when I come to bangkok. It may not be the most luxurious or newest but it never disappoints. The location is remarkable with the bts a few steps away and the link bridge can bring me to a few places down the train line if I choose to take a walk instead.  Even though there are new faces at the front desks whenever I come, their service is always impeccable. They are always smiling and ready to help. I want to especially thank Toey, Kate and Pichy for being so accomodating and helpful. You gals make my day!",5,0.9818
"Thank you to Mr.Manop! I accidentally dropped my sunglasses at the front door. Mr.Manop kept it and passed to lost&amp;found in its original condition. Besides, guards at basement level and front desk receptionists were very helpful as well. Great service indeed.",5,0.9052

"Basic hotel so you don't have to move around too much, located in the shopping precinct and a short stroll to MBK shopping centre. Breakfast looked grand but not much of a variety.  Rooms are basic with no frills or whistles",3,-0.2023
Stayed three nights at this Accor group hotel. Price was ok including breakfast.    Checkin was smooth and quick. Deposit of 1000 thb per night was collected. Not mentioned on booking.com.   Room was adequate. Stayed in 1502. The first night it had a rather unpleasant smell in it. I put it down to the sewage system. Smell disappeared the next day. Bathroom was a little grubby and in need of some maintenance. Bed comfortable and large. Plenty of space and a lovely city view. Good housekeeping.   Breakfast was fine. Not awesome but adequate and very busy.   Bar in the evening was good. Excellent selection of gin. Very impressive.   Overall a nice stay.   ,4,0.9765
"Booked 3 months before arrival as Accor member with full advance room paid, still  doesn't get any priviledge. Would not recommend to any unless stay in newly renovated room.

Not only that, she went beyond to help us find a place to eat that late at night and even helped us call a Grab. We ended up in Patpong and had an amazing time browsing the market! Highly recommend this hotel. Oh! Definitely recommend the breakfast as well. It was DELICIOUS.",5,0.9887

The hotel is stylish design and very good location to the shopping malls in Siam. The ladies are polite and sweet to guests, very good customer service so highly recommended :)   ",5,0.9586

Stayed at different novotel resort around Thailand but this one stands out in terms of location and services offered.  All team members work hard to make sure you are enjoying holiday.   We really enjoyed there seafood buffet every night. Its truly amazing and value for money spent. It was fresh and service was amazing. The hotel Resident Manager Mr Michael specially came to check our table to make sure we are enjoying our meals.  All in all it was a great experience and we are already planning to visit again in near future.,5,0.9945

"This hotel does not really deliver the standards it claims and does not match Accor reputation. Positive points: location, bed quality, check in/out process, cleanness of rooms. Negative: overall staff with poor English, aged restaurants, noisy and jammed breakfast room, poor finishing quality of renovated bathrooms.  Better go to Vie hotel, Accor Group also, but better value for money.",2,0.6597
"This is my second time staying at this hotel. The location is amazing, it's within walking distance to all the big shopping malls in Bangkok. The hotel service is excellent, especially the reception who helped me checked in, her name is Toktak. The deluxe room is really nice. ",5,0.8908
"Apart from the location, being right smack in the middle of Siam with easy public transport, there is nothing positive to comment about this hotel. It's incredibly worn out, staffs are pretty inexperience and not too helpful, massage and spa is expensive (extremely old and dirty as well), bed and bathroom...TERRIBLE! Totally not worth the price. This hotel should really close down in order to keep up Accor's good name ",1,-0.4377
"We stayed at this very central location hotel on our family stop over in Bangkok. Delighted with our choice, close to everything, giving us a chance to shop.  Good breakfast and enjoyed our time around the pool bar on level four. ",4,0.8934

"Arrived at 1:00AM after long international flight and Toktak provided excellent front desk service and got me checked in quickly. I've stayed here many many times and for my money it has the best location, amentities, and staff in Bangkok. Right next to Siam Paragon and the Siam BTS station.",5,0.836
Hotel is located very centrally in the downtown Bangkok - almost next to the metro line. Plenty of restaurants and shopping in close vincinity. Rooms seem to have been renovated recently. Breakfast is good but prepare to wait to find a seat - long queues can be expected. Decent pool. Hotel staff are very friendly and helpful.,4,0.8953
"Novotel Siam Square is probably the best located hotel in Bangkok if you like a location near a convenient BTS station and central malls.    From the Siam Station, if you prefer not to carry your luggage down the stairs, you could use the escalators in the Siam Square One Mall.    The area around the hotel is a little untidy with motor cycle parking and not completely covered drains.    The hotel lobby has a funky vibe but is looking a little tired.     Our queen room was of a decent size, modern in design,  and most amenities were provided (kettle, slippers, bottled water etc).   The only issue of note was that the room was rather dimly lit though they corrected it by trolleying in a large lamp.    I also appreciated that they remembered my birthday with cake and congratulatory",4,0.6416

In the bathroom, the soap holder was already rusting, walls cracking, floor gradient badly done, causing water to accumulate instead of flowing to the drain. Very poor workmanship. Doors slam shut so loud on every room, non existent soundproofing. You'd wake up early in the morning from all the door slamming and loud talking from the corridor. I could even hear hotel phones ringing from another room. ",2,-0.8315

"I have stayed at Novotel hotels across the globe and first time it was such a bad experience at the Bangkok on Siam Square.   Basic courtesy  issues from the staff and they ask customers to pay extra for no reason, they don't understand language (which they should try to work and improve upon, especially in a hotel which has a global reputation.  1) The breakfast area where food was served had cockroaches roaming around 2) room is not cleaned up in time and staff says they had lot of rooms to clean up, such a lame excuse 3) they want to charge double for room service despite the rates being clearly mentioned on the room service menu, the staff is totally pathetic and then they serve half quantity liquor ordered in the room 4) they want to charge extra for providing  breakfast",2,-0.2944

This made no sense especially with people sharing a twin room. Spoke to the duty manager and they managed to move me another room where the toilet had no issues with privacy the following morning.

"Overall, the room at Novotel Bangkok on Siam Square was decent. Just be careful of the transportation lure at the concierge. We actually call a Grab car to the airport. A friendly concierge staff (inside the hotel lobby) asked how much are we paying and offered a slightly cheaper rate at THB $400 inclusive of ‚Äúeverything‚Äù. We declined and went out to wait for our Grab car at the dropping off lobby. Then another friendly uncle from the outdoor concierge approached us and offered THB $300 to the airport inclusive of ‚Äúeverything‚Äù again. This time we agreed and he immediately loaded our luggage onto a BMW, car plate number 2150, while asking for upfront cash payment. After we sat in the car digging for cash, the THB $300 became THB $600. So we asked how did the THB $300 become",2,0.8591

I stayed here multiple times in the last 3 years and saw a drop in standard everywhere. The buffet breakfast was bad. Fried rice and noodle were tasteless and awful. The supposed poach egg was stone cold. The noodle station served soggy noodle.    Checked into a room with noisy aircon and had to move. Keycard stop working in the middle of stay without any explanation. The spoon in the room was not washed properly and was still sticky.   Bad experience overall. There are many cheaper and better alternative places to stay. The only great thing is the location. For that I give 1 star.,1,-0.7906
Great experience in a fantastic hotel. Very central in the city center just minutes away from skytrain and all the big shopping center such as Siam Square and Paragon.  Lots of shops and restaurants around the hotel and a 24x7 Starbucks and 7-Eleven on the other site of the street. Great rooms and the staff is very friendly and helpful.

"We were comparing Conrad and this property noting that the cost is about the same; having visited Bangkok multiple times and stayed at both properties, we decided to go with Novotel this time on the primary basis of its location.   It is right smack in Siam Square with shops, eateries, BTS all within walking distance. I would give it a 5 star for the location.   The team at the Premier Lounge was warm and friendly - always courteous during check in/out as well as breakfast/canap√© - 4 stars here. I can't say the same for the staff on the 2nd floor cafe. Completely indifferent and at times to the point of rude - maybe due to the crazy stress level of the crowd each morning? Unfortunately for the Premier Lounge team, your rating has been brought down by your other colleagues to 3",3,-0.2944

"Hotel is located near to many shopping centres. The staff were very helpful. The room was very clean and modern. However, the gym could do with a refresh as the outlook was a little dated. Otherwise I had a delightful stay and will definitely stay here again when in Bangkok. ",5,0.9116
"It's our eleventh stay at Novotel Siam Square and the experience is getting better every year when we stay here.  We have slight issues with our room and the staff, especially Poh was diligently following-up for us. Definitely coming back to Novotel Siam Square for our next visit. Keep it up, Novotel Siam Square!",4,0.7088
"As usual, great staffs, services and excellent location. I have stayed many times in NSS and I hate your hair dryer to the core. It has and needs to be change. The hairdryer plug doesn't stay on and will unplug with every little movement. Another issue will be the toilet sliding door, the toilet door gap is so big my friend can see clearly what I am doing inside. (Rm 1410) It's not something i expect or want to happen when I'm traveling with anyone. ",4,0.8901

"On the old side, crowded, limited and low quality toiletries, coffee and tea too Extremely busy, reception not coping Modest bar, most of the staff not fluent in English Swimming pool full of children, one very, very small room for fitness, one shower and minuscule steam- definitely crying for renovation Big cockroach crossing the room",3,-0.3182
"That was a lucky meal on our holiday, We went to Bangkok with my family but in our group we had elder and infant and we stayed at The novotel Bangkok Siam Square, For the dinner we just looked for some place that we needed convenience for them. So my wife she gave an opinion to reserved a table at The Lok Wah Hin restaurant in The hotel.  That was a some lucky story for us cause waiter and waitress in there so kind and helpful Mr.Vichian who is a manager of Lok Wah Hin recommended us for everything as food drink he brought new food dish everytime when he walked pass our table.  and he said ""if you like this food you can take it more but you don't like no worry"" he quite fair for customer.  one more thing a price is very fair I think you can not get this price around siam",5,0.9895

Poh is really helpful throughout our check in process and booked our van for tomorrow morning. She even helped us to find restaurants and massage nearby. And also explaining thoroughly the facilities in the hotel.,5,0.4754
"I would have to say the hotel is in a great location ie walking distance to BTS and major shopping centres and eateries. Only take the renovated rooms . The shower doors don't close tight so after shower the outside floor and walls get wet. Housekeeping is mediocre.  What is often taken for granted when staying in a hotel is security. This hotel needs to look into serious security breaches which starts with a ""sometimes almost market place lobby area"" where nearby lift access is without key card. There have been reported theft in trip advisor and I am now one statistic. It was unfortunate that the only 1 time I left my bag open,  items was stolen from my luggage.   The management was informed and I gotten the classic replies : ""On behalf of Ms. Poh, May I would like to informed",1,0.6943
"This hotel has been our favourite for a long long time. Excellent location, well versed and helpful staffs are on most guests' priority list. Novotel delivers all that and many more. Definitely our choice whenever we visit Bangkok. Keep up the good work. Special mention to your amicable and helpful guest relations officer, Poh. She definitely made everyone feels welcome.",5,0.9741
"My family and I had a chance to visit Bangkok for our business trip and we chose Novotel Siam.  Again with the very well prepared from the operation team, we were greeted by the most polite and professional hotel's limousine and bell boys, Khun Sunattha also arranged perfectly the rooms and everything which my daughter's need (for my family, you are the best staff ever).  Checking process went smoothly by Khun Praew and every time we used the Lounge we always had the very warm welcome from the staff Khun Yaya, Khun Mam, Khun Vi and Khun Fon.   Our dinner at the famous Lok Wah Hin restaurant was really really wonderful not only the most testy of the dishes but also the staff Khun Vichien who provided the best service there.  I'd like to thank you personally to Khun Noei for her",5,0.9781

And we're quite enjoy and happy staying at Novotel hotel on Siam Square, it consider the best hotel compare to others that we stayed before. It close to shopping mall and BTS train. Overall the location is good and convienient. All tourist should consider this when plan to visit BKK next time. Lastly, the hotel rooms are spacious, comfortable and clean. Louge and lobby really nice deco, nice environment esp sitting at swinging chair while enjoying the music.",5,0.9921
The hotel is a very old and at a very good location. Just minutes walk to Siam BTS and Siam Paragon Mall. Service is good. I booked 2 rooms (joint room) But both room we stayed in for 4 nights are smelly and stuffy.This made us feel very uncomfortable. Although the house keeping did spray air freshener but it just work for a while. Maybe it is the air condition system is too old.  ,4,0.3064

"We are having a great time at the premier lounge of the hotel. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful. Praew was at the front desk who help checked us in, she was extremely cheerful and managed to help in our various requests. We had happy hours at the lounge which was manned by just 2 staff. However the 2 staff were extremely efficient, they managed to clear tables, prepare cocktails and refill wine...with cheerful smile all the time. Great to see such friendly staff who are able to keep cool and calm with constant traffic. Keep up the good effort Mam and ThaüòÅ",5,0.9938
"Got a very large and comfortable room. Had a full day in Bangkok so got a reasonably priced late checkout. Piichy at the front desk was very helpful with transport to the airport. It is literally on Siam square, so going out at night or for shopping doesn't require anything besides two legs :-)",5,0.8384
"We booked as Accorplus members and were disappointed to be given a suite that had a water leak (saturated carpet), black mould and a faulty airconditioner unit. It looked nothing like the rooms online, more something from the 70's. (Room 1231)The next day we were able to move to the 8th floor and it was wonderful. There are rooms that are fully refurbished, make sure you ask for those! Lounge and staff, especially Poh was wonderful. Staff at the restaurant are not familiar with Accorplus discounts, incl the manager at the lobby bar. He said only advantage plus is eligible for a discount. Which is what it used to be called many years ago.  Pool has potential, but edges are so sharp that the kids got many injuries from entering the pool.   However, the location couldn't be better",3,-0.3235
"This novotel doesn't match at all with all the others i've done in europe. The rooms are very dirty. We have to wait before taking the breakfast ...  Only positive thing, after one night they accept to cancel the other days of our booking.  Really disappointing.",1,-0.3582
"Pros: 1) Location is great. Less than 5 minutes to the nearest BTS staion, Siam. 2) Friendly staff. A lady staff at the check-in counter helped me to login their WIFI network. 3) Good breakfast. Sunny egg is my favourte :) 4) Room is spacious. In additon to the queen, it also includes a sofa bed which I think is more comfy than the queen bed. Cons: 1) There is an open area about 100m away (close to the pool) from the hotel which plays noisy music at night. It even plays at 3am. Ridiculous! 2) The mattress is too soft. 3) Room door is not sound proof enough. There is a 1~2 cm gap at the bottom of the door. Noise outside the room can be heard easily.",4,0.9551

"When i book this hotel, the photo showed very nice and colorful, but the fact is all facilities very old, no iron available, room very small, overall this is 3 starts standard hotel. Also very disappointing with the Accor group arrangement. i am the member of this hotel group, I booked this hotel via travel agent, they don't offer the bonus points which is fine, but they don't can't my stay and extend my bonus points expiry date, this is absolutely not acceptable. As this hotel not respect the member, i never stay with this group hotel anymore ",1,-0.9545
"Always my top choice hotel to stay whenever I visit this city. The hotel is centrally located, and has wonderful attentive staff. Special mention to Tom, who have helped with my check in today. He is efficient and does his best to accommodate to my requests. Am glad that Novotel has such a great staff and service, that really speaks volumes about the work culture that Accor has.  Oh yes, it's really nice of the hotel to provide 2 cupcakes to welcome me back.",5,0.9836
"It was located near a BTS station and major shopping malls.   We booked a suite and a premier room. They said that the rooms would be ready at 2 pm. When we went back at 2 pm, the staff told us to go back at 2.30 pm.   The rooms are clean but poorly maintained. Lamps and TV are spoilt and one of the bathrooms could not be locked.   The staff are friendly but quite a few of them could not understand simple English. I made a reservation at the restaurant but when I went back in the evening, the few waitresses could not understand me and told me that the restaurant was full. I got in eventually.  There were 6 of us and my husband was trying to get 3 plates of beef but the Chef did not allow him to do so.  It was strange as it was a buffet dinner.  Anyway, the beef cubes dish was",2,0.5115

Very warm welcome by TokTak during check-in and offered complimentary extra bed throughout the stay. On my 3rd day i lost my laundry to someone i accidentally passed to (Luckily i took pictures of the van). Didn't get any helped from the concierge and again i reported the event to the same person during check-in and she escalated to its manager. I have no hope its going to be returned but at least i tried. It surprised me when i was informed i have my laundry bag to be collected in their system during my check-out. And it happens to be my laundry that i report. The hotel service was very helpful during the stay.   There is also areas of improvements to be made i.e hotel toilet needs a little bit of work on cleanings. But overall the stay was satisfactory.,4,0.9369
"We check-in to the Hotel and the reception had upgrade us to the newly renovated room. However, the newly renovated room was not better than the old ones. The floor of the washroom was dirty with mold.There was obvious leaking from the washroom to the wooden floor beside the bed.  I reported this to the reception, they had tried their best to accommodate, but at the end, we choose to stay at the older model ones with a seemingly cleaner washroom. Anyways, the front desk group was very friendly and had indicated they will reflect this to management.  My friend from Bangkok had warned me that the Hotel is old, but I told him Novotel Bangkok on Siam Square had newly renovated rooms, so should be okay. but it turned out my friend was right.  The location is good which was why I",3,0.9651

The service was impeccable ... our every need, wish was attended to ... we felt very welcome ... Fresh flowers, gluten-free bread, drinks of choice ( before asking for them) ... they had done their homework about our preferences very well... A special shoutout to Yaya and Mam in the Executive Lounge: they made sure we were well taken care of... My husband commented, ""It feels like home, you come in and you are served exactly what you want"" ... Yes, it did feel like home ... P.S.

"Just had an 8 night stay. First 2 nights spent in Rm 1231. Aircon was not functioning well and had to be turned on at full blast to properly chill the room. The air in the room was very stale and musky but I tried to put up with it. After 2 nights, it was not possible as I was practically awake throughout the night and as a result I fell ill without the proper rest. Spent 3 of the 8 nights going to bed early to try and recover and had to skip our evening plans.  We approached the front desk for a change of room and were assisted by Mr Patter, who immediately took us up to view a replacement room, Rm 1003. The difference in air quality was apparent the moment we entered. Mr Patter arranged for porters to assist with our move and the moment we went into the new room, he had even",3,-0.6258
