"Great location, great price. Hotel is surrounded directly with massage, travel shop, taylor, street food, laundry. The hotel has a nice onsite restaurant with a decent selection of local and western foods altho you will find cheaper within a few seconds walk in either direction. There is a 7/11 just outside hotel and an atm and a chemist type place. Room was large and clean and cleaned regularly altho the cleaners were very noisy early in the morning chatting to each other or on their phones. We were on the 5th floor of block A which was perfect as it was the closest floor to the pool. The roof top pool was lovely and the general area clean altho a slight lack in sunbeds especially in the shade as no extra umbrellas. Many people left towels on sunbeds then went off for breakfast",5,0.9539
"The hotel is what it is, it’s definitely no frills.  The outside space is beautiful though and the location is fantastic.   the rooms are tiny and the facilities out of date, the bed is hard but as we were only staying 2 nights we put up with it.  No towels available for the pool, 1 towel each in bathroom and no hand towels.  no pool bar despite being on the roof however there is a vending machine and some of the buttons even worked!! The pool area gets quite overcrowded.  The breakfast was ok. I would suggest this would suit short stay back packers looking for cheap accommodation as the rates are really cheap.   I think this was more our error of judgement as it didn’t suit what we wanted however the rooms were clean at least and may suit others.  Note there is no lift and",3,0.2183
I would look around before booking here.the location is good.pool area very nice. We found it very noisy at night breakfast was a mad rush of people.The room was clean. I think there are better places to stay  ,3,0.5423
"Good hotel for a relaxed stay when arriving to Bangkok. People are very nice, attentive and helpful. The breakfast with lots of variety, clean rooms and a rooftop pool help you to arrive within these climate conditions.  ",4,0.9468
"The service, the cleanliness, the bathroom, the location, everything was far worse than expected. The internet pictures must not be recent, or demonstrate what you actually receive.  Do not recommend this hotel.",1,-0.6381
"We stay here a lot, maybe two to three times per year over the last decade or so. For the Banglamphu area its perfect. In Bangkok tourists are absolutely spoilt for choice but we always stay here normally at the beginning of our trip and then the transition when we need to come back for onward travel. Dont expect frills but if you want to be right on the quiter end of atmospheric soi rambuttri stay here. We would recommend the paying a bit more for the premier rooms at the front. In terms of noise, the hustle and bustle of this street isnt an issue. Light sleepers may here the monks about 4am chanting at waat songkran opposite, but this is authentic and not an issue. Great service and the staff are always busy checking travellers in/out. It's a busy place and has a great",4,0.8052
"I liked the hotel. I had never been to Bangkok or Thailand. I booked on Booking.com and got a great rate for a single bed, single room, solo traveller. Initially I had only booked for 2 days thinking that if I did not like the room / location / hotel, I would change to another location.  However, the location is great and it is lively and close to Khaosan road (less than 5 min walk).  It is also close to the river, where you can take a hop on/ off ferry for 200 baht and ride the ferry all day stopping to visit landmarks.  Of course, if you just want to go from one pier location to another, that is like 25 baht, but not on the tourist boat.   The room was clean but had an old box TV. (Breakfast not included for single rooms). When I went to extend it, they said room was already",3,0.8831
"The place is within walking distance from the Khao San Road and yet very quiet. The street itself has lots of restaurants and cafes. I traveled alone and paid for a triple room, because the single room was very small. Breakfast is very rich, but the complex is busy and noisy. The room was tidy but could be improved at the level of cleanliness. I slept there two nights and found out that the linens were arranged but not replaced. The service at the reception is very slow and you need to wait quite a while. Great location for enjoying this part of Bangkok.",3,0.9495
"Rambuttri village is still a good choice in this aerea of BKK. Breakfast good, pool very good, but I can't recommend the rambuttri terrace, which differently from the hotel service is terrible and rude staff. But it's not essential to me so I will still choose the rambuttri for my stay in bkk",4,-0.7885
"They forced me to pay parts of my meal even if they put pork instead of chicken in my curry - twice! No pride there... no ""I am sorry, of course you don`t have to pay"" only ""money money money"". Never Rambuttri village again!  The red curry was the less tasty that I have ever had too.... Then I found pork (for the second time) in my food and left. ",1,-0.7707
"Very bad internet, staff claims that it is ok and doesn't do anything about it.  Food is decent, staff is slow and you have to wait for a knife for 3min etc..  Location is perfect, cannot be better, no noise from Rhambutri and Khao San Road, which is in 2min walking distance. ",3,0.1504
"Terrible restaurant and unfriendly service staff. Food came out cold and tasted terrible. Restaurant staff refused to do anything about it. Restaurant manager indicated that the food was edible and I must pay for it. Very unfriendly service, would not recommend this restaurant.",1,-0.9314
"Central location in the 'old town' part of the city. Friendly and helpful staff, good facilities. Had to leave a 1,000 Thai Bart deposit on checking in which of course was refunded when we left. Room basic but clean and perfectly adequate for a short stay. Overall great value for the money we paid. Would definitely stay there again.",4,0.9817
"Clean, nice hotel close to Khao San Rd. The rooftop pool is nice and the view is great. The best part of the hotel was the breakfast, I was really impressed with the huge variety of items. Everything was delicious and fresh. Also the huge koi pond in the restaurant plaza is a really nice touch.  The location is very good. One street off of Khao San- if you are into that. Walking distance to the Grand Palace. Phra Athit is just a street away and the tourist ferry is very convenient.   Would definately stay again and recommend this hotel.",4,0.9906
Good location. Basic rooms. Recomend to take breakfest. One thing what you should be carefull is with staff. They will ask money for everything. Even for make a call to reserve a table in restorant. If you want to leave luggage after you leaving hotel extra 20 Bath.,3,0.4588
"Left this lovely hotel yesterday, basic rooms, clean, great value for money with one of the best breakfasts I’ve had in a hotel, great variety of food and very tasty. One minute walk to shops and you don’t get hassled to buy off them they leave you to look without pushing you for a sale. Surrounded by lovely restaurants and bars, had a lovely 3 course meal with 3 beers for under £25 a couple, would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,0.9855
"About says it all really. Great location, clean room, very very helpful staff. Reasonable price. Rooftop pool, but no rooftop bar as their online advertising may suggest. Breakfast had plenty to choose from. Loads of local bars &amp; restaurants, recommended “Sawasdee Bar” just around the corner, spent NYE in there, great night. Would stay again.",4,0.8982
Not the most amazing place I have stayed but for the price and the fun location I would definitely recommend the Rambutti Village. Be sure you have 1000 Baht on you when you arrive though for the deposit-there are plenty of ATMs around but save yourself the hassle and come prepared. ,3,0.9623
"This was our first hotel upon arrival in Thailand. We can say for the price we'd paid the hotel was fine. Staff was friendly and helpfull, swimmingpool was lovely and the room clean and complete. Just don't expect a high standard type of accomodation. However the breakfast was really good quality wise and plenty of choice in food. Coffee was real fresh and breakfast is set at the inner garden with a tropical pond for the right ambiance to go with your coffee. The location is convienent and easy to reach from the international airport. As we booked our domestic flight here also the way back to the airport was even less stressfull. The neighbourhood seems to focus mainly on Western tourists and this ofcourse brings the typical chaviness like pizza restaurants and horrible",4,0.9655
This hotel is very beautiful With a very big swimming pool. The room is very clean and big. I spent here 3 nights with my girlfriend. The location is very nice close to many interesting spot. We will be back here for sure,5,0.9358
"This was our second stay here, the first time was 2 years ago.  I have no hesitation in recommending it.  The position in the lane is great, so interesting with all the shops and stalls in the lane each night, and so attractive. The building and rooms are very well kept, clean, spacious and have everything you need. The lovely pool on the roof has views over the city and to the river.  The Breakfast and it's setting, must be the best anywhere for this type of accommodation. So good.  Rambuttri is handy to the Phra Arthit Pier just down the road for easy access to the river.  Wat Pho and The Grand Palace are walkable distance.  Wat Arun is just across the river. Thonburi Railway Station just across the river for access by train in The Bridge Over The River Kwai and Kanchanaburi.",5,0.9841
"Location is the best thing about this hotel. Right in the heart of the Khao San Rd district but far enough away to be sheltered from the noise. The street outside is delightfully alive every evening with fairy lights, stall holders, restaurants and massage beds. It’s just 5 mins walk to the river which is by far the best way to get around to most of the major sights such as the Grand Palace and Chinatown. Just watch the end times for ferries.   Rooms are basic but clean. Sheets are nice.Towels and bath mats definitely need replacing.   Staff could not be described as warm or friendly. For example be careful travelling as a family and booking more than one room - despite multiple requests over months prior, the hotel put us and our children’s rooms on different floors and would",3,0.9869
"Location was great, right in the middle of it all but set back far enough that the noise wasn’t a problem. Swimming pool was nice on the roof. Buffet breakfast was a mix of all sorts, if you couldn’t find something there I’d be surprised. Mr Thai the tour guide in the plaza is your man if you need anything, he’s friendly, amusing and helpful ! Bottom line, if I was to go back to the area in Bangkok would we stay again ? Yes we would, good value for money and great location",3,0.9871
"The quality matches the price. Do not expect too much. It’s close to everything around khao san road. It’s a very busy hotel because it completes requirement for basics. Clean room, ok service, nearby everything, breakfast and pool.",3,0.5994
The lady staff member was very rude (short hair lady) when we ordered food (literally just ordered food straight from The menu with a smile) and then when we asked for a glass of ice as the Fanta was warm  (which we didn’t complain about the warms Fanta - just asked for ice) she yelled at us in Thai. No idea what she said. But sounded angry. I think she was having a bad day as we were friendly and smiling.  She slammed down the cutlery on our table. My wine glass was dirty with lipstick (I don’t wear lipstick or gloss) I didn’t dare mention it.  Food was decent but we will never come back.  The staff who delivered food and drinks were friendly. ,2,0.2508
"Had dinner here. Food was delicious, but the experience was spoiled by the very slow service. Our order was taken quickly but then we waited ages for the food to arrive. Afterwards we had to ask for the bill twice and even then it took about 1/2 an hour to come - then we had to wait again for the change. Although I enjoyed the food I probably wouldn’t go here again, as I don’t always want to wait that long,",3,0.8047
"Stayed three nights here. Well located for a lot of the sights, and lots of restaurants/bars nearby.  Was able to check in at 08.00 (if I paid in cash), which was a real bonus after a long flight.  Nice rooftop pool.  Air con was incredibly loud, and paying (not very much) to leave my bag there for a few hours when I checked out seemed a bit of a ripoff",4,0.7867
"I booked a single room for one night to get a good night's sleep after my flight from Germany and before flying on to Sydney.  The fare by taxi from the airport (up to one hour) is 400-500 Baht.  I spent the afternoon chilling at the rooftop pool, a swim really revived me.  Then I walked around the area, lots to see, no problem for a woman on her own.  Chose a restaurant in Khaosan Road for dinner, good atmosphere all around.  All so close to the hotel.  Went for a manicure, pedicure and leg massage after dinner. Perfect. Room was basic but good enough, breakfast by koi pool included brunch meals.  Staff were helpful and friendly.  Walked to Royal Palace after breakfast.  Then had time for a cold beer before taking taxi back to airport.  I would go again.",4,0.9393
"Fifth Jomtien Pattaya has a good reputation if reviews are to be believed.  And, they should be believed!  The hotel is about 350 meters to the beach, along a road with restaurants and shops so lots of options are available.  It's right down from one of the best restaurants in Pattaya (Thai Aroi Dee).  The pool at Fifth Jomtien is really nice, but construction nearby cuts the sun off at about 2:50 and it's just a tad cool for our liking.  Still, it's a great pool.  There is a small but sufficient gym.  The inexpensive rooms are very large and well appointed.  The breakfast is awesome with everything one could want including an omelette bar.  Oh, did I mention they have TWO rooftop pools?  The best part though is the really kind and sweet staff, from the cleaning lady, to the",5,0.9921
"The staff is very nice, they seem to enjoy working here and that’s a good sign and gives a good vibe in general. The room was very clean, cozy and quit (except for the early wakings buy the mosque - the imam must be a professional singer - what a voice!). The pool is clean and very inviting. Breakfast is VERY good, being a vegetarian I had many options. The location is good, although your in the middle of the party zone. This hotel has succeeded in making everything just perfect. We will definitely be back.    ",4,0.9888

"I travelled throuh Asia for one month in November and December. In total, I stayed in 10 hotels. I decided to leave comments for the best and the worst and this is, for sure, the worst one.  Basically, the staff was not very kind! And the staff makes the difference in our stays.  They asked for a key deposit in cash (why???), but the website i used to book did not say anything about it. They said: ""u have no cash? Ok. Go outside and withdraw.""  The location is very good. Close to Khao San Road. The swimming pool is also very nice.",3,0.8287
"The mixed reviews had me nervous but i had a wonderful stay here! Stayed twice (Nov and Dec 2019) and will return. My rooms were both on the 5th floor in building E, cute and clean (and excellent value for money after some hotels i'd previously stayed at on this trip), breakfast great (but go early as it can be a jungle of hungry angry tourists after 8.30). Loved the pool (again, go in the morning when its almost empty). The restaurant is double the price of others just around the corner but loved the vibe there! My advice - ask for high floor in building E!",5,0.9891

"Excelent location. Great buffet breakfast. They offer a storage room where you can leave your luggage for $20baht per bag per day for up to 3 months. Good restaurant with reasonable price. Worth the money you pay. Outside the hotel is really good, but looks a different place inside. The rooms are old, noisy air conditioning. Internet do not work properly inside the room. Also, you can hear the mosque few times a day. You must leave a deposit of $1000 baht. People from tailor shop annoying, constantly approach you at the hotel entrance. ",3,0.012
"Beware of the photos displayed by the booking site or rambuttri hotel site because most of them are fake ! You expect a sort of ""resort"" in the city  and you get sort of ""garage"" as a room : most of them open on dirty walls, lurid service areas of the hotel or other unbearable things....none has a balcony ( what you see in photos is an outside decor to hide the AC noisy motors...that keep pissing water everywhere ). Booked with booking but they cancelled my reservation the day of arrival because they tried to charge the whole stay ( who gave them permission ?) on credit card number i had given JUST FOR GUARANTY AS REQUESTED IN CASE OF NO SHOW ( and clearly asking them to pay cash at arrival ). So my reservation was cancelled (thanks god i say now! ) and i stayed only 1 night",1,-0.6791
I loved the location of this hotel especially our room which overlooked the street but was still quiet.  Breakfast was good.  Only downside nowhere to sit if you didn't want to go to a bar and you didn't want to go to your room.  We sat in the bar belonging to the hotel which had no customers and was asked to move if we weren't buying.  It was middle of the day.  Pool isn't great.  Too small not many sun beds.,3,-0.6318
"The good-   Location-   Perfect if you're wanting to stay in the lively Khosan area Swimming pool -was good, plenty of sunbeds  The not so good- Room wasn't cleaned during our two night stay.  Even though we expected it to be noisy due to the location, it kept us up one night until 1am. This wasn't due to noise coming from the bars however from the building site next door to the hotel!   We would return :)",4,0.9508
"Convenient place to stay near Khao San.  Very comfortable beds and staff were helpful.  A little nosy sometimes due to the location. The restaurant is also better than expected, but priced higher than similiar places nearby.  And the pool was ideal for a cooling dip after  a day at the Grand palace.",4,0.9293
"We left here early this morning after a three day stay. We enjoyed our time at the rambuttri, it was a clean spacious room with everything we needed at a reasonable price. Our room overlooked the street which we really liked as we enjoyed watching all the comings and goings once we had finished for the  day although it was quite in our room.  The location is great near kho san road but a lot quite Good spread for breakfast  The staff were great friendly and helpful.",4,0.9811

Allow one hour drive to or from main international airport.  Room clean, basic, but adequate.    Excellent buffet breakfast.  Ate one evening meal in their adjourning restaurant, food was good and they serve wine.  Quite expensive though.  Didn't use or look at the pool as we were too busy.",3,0.9645

I booked my room for 7 days online it is a 4 star hotel and for 7 mights cost me $462.00 with buffet breeky.:) Just a few notes about Rambutti hotel there small rooms with aircon,a smal frig and self containd with own shower and toilet, also a roof top swimming pool with a great view over the city, i give this hotel 4 out of 5 great value. :)",4,0.9834
"The good: A good budget option. You are in the centre of Bangkok. We upgraded to superior room which is much better as the shower is western style.   The food for breakfast is really delicious, although a bit different to what I usually eat for breakfast so it was good to have a Thai type breakfast.   The rooms are good sized and there is a safe in each room  Location is perfect. Just off khao san road and in the thick of it at Bangkok by surprisingly quiet.  The bad:  The bed was hard and I got some back pain  The aircon is SO LOUD it’s hard to sleep, they definitely need to get this fixed.

There is a small but nice pool on the rooftop.  The area has lots of street food, massage, tour shop, street shopping,  bar n restaurants and mini-marts.  A short walk to  Khao sao street.  This place is easy to reach, you can take a Khao san road shuttle bus from and to the Bkk Airport.",4,0.9194
"We were fooled by the photos, the pool and the positive reviews.  This cavernous place is very shabby and run down and not at all like the photos  Our “superior” room stank of stale cigarette smoke, had greying bedding, no storage whatever, no hand towels and the noisiest most ineffective air con I’ve ever come across.  It sounded like a plane landing and had one setting - freezing. The pool was like a public baths and not somewhere to relax which we had wanted.  The biggest gripe is the 1000 baht cash key deposit they demanded on check in - even though we paid by credit card.   It probably won’t make any difference and they won’t care anyway.  People will still stay here because it’s fairly cheap.  However if you can, spend a little bit more and stay elsewhere.",1,-0.7294
"Good location, rooms are ok, but not very clean.  Stained bed linen, hairs all over the place. I think the cleaning staff is just making the beds and not cleaning really. Sound isolation doesn’t exist so it can get pretty noisy. You hear the streets all the time. ",2,-0.3356

Lots of nice restaurants and street food nearby. The A4 bus from the Airport drops you right at the top of the road so only a short walk to hotel.

"We have stayed here before, it seems they have gotten a bit worse. We stayed in the ‘most deluxe’ of suites. This is a bargain place, I get that. But I think maybe with the flow of people stealing things they now give you ONE roll of toilet paper at a time, NO hand towels. You get 1 roll of toilet paper and two towels and if you want any more towels you must give those back. IT was not that bad last time. So there has been toilet paper theifs or something. Hard beds, like all of Asia.  AC works wonderfully in the ‘newer’ rooms. Buffet breakfast is decent. Staff is friendly sometimes.  I don’t know if I would stay again at this point as this time the Wifi literally did not work in our room. We complained and they sent a guy up to ‘do nothing’ and just tell us weather effects it",2,0.6016

I found the staff at the hotel not very friendly and some I thought were rude. The location of the hotel isn’t brilliant not near the MRT or BTS, but is very near Khaosan RD. This hotel is cheap and I guess you get what you pay for, I would definitely not stay here again.",2,0.0843

"Rambuttri Village Inn has different room types and the cheapest ones (no elevator) have low quality. Breakfast is not included in room price and costs 250 Bhat / person, so if I include this extra it will be easy to find better deals in other areas of the city. On the other hand the pool is quite good and the location is unbeatable for those who want to be near Khaosan Road. In short, I will consider returning to this hote onlyl if I need to take the morning bus that connects with the Lomprayah ferry to the gulf islands.",3,0.8858
"I’m sorry to have to say that because the other staff (cleaning ladies, luggage attendants) are really welcoming and willing to help, but the staff at the reception are just obnoxious.  The list of reproaches is long: no smile, no discussion possible, poor English, no patience, lots of aggressivity, no skill to advise about basic things such as taxis or places to visit around the hotel, no will to compromise. They apparently haven’t given a thought about what it is to be a tourist or what it is to be made to feel at home in a new place. Surely, the hotel is great, the location is wonderful, the rooms are quite cheap considering the facilities given. But to be so ill treated when you arrive in a new place is just unacceptable!  What’s more, you need to pay for luggage attendance",3,-0.9056

The hotel is in an excellent location on Khao San Road so you was never bored of things to do but far away that it wasn't noisy. It was average, clean but we did not use to facilities such as the roof top pool as we were out most of the time. We have nothing to complain about with this hotel and if you go right when exiting the hotel, there are lots of really nice restaurants and bars to eat at which are really nice! :) In comparison to many hotels, we believe this hotel is little overpriced at £25 a night when we have seen others in the area but I would recommend this hotel!!",3,0.9831

"We stayed for 3 days here and it is very accessible to the Khaosan Night Market. Our room was okay, the restroom was a bit smelly maybe because of the drainage. There was an ongoing construction where our room was located (I think we were in the new building) during the day upto 5pm it was noisy. We had our aircon serviced because it wasn’t operating properly. The receptionists were very accommodating and friendly and addressed our concern right away. They provided rooms with personal toiletries and towels which is good because not all budget hotels were like that. Overall our stay was pretty good considering its price.",4,0.9345

"We didn’t stay at the hotel but ate dinner at the restaurant late yesterday evening when we were in a rush to eat something after a busy evening.   All I can say is the food is HORRENDOUS, and I would rather eat off the floor than go to this place again. We ordered 2 curries and 2 rices, as well as a roti. The 2 curries were watered down that they were tasteless, and the chicken in one of the curries was pure skin (absolutely no meat at all). We also asked for no chillies in either dish and both had chillies. The roti was like cardboard, you could literally crack it in two. We spoke to one of the employees and said the food was inedible and that we genuinely couldn’t eat it as it was that pure water and no meat, and all they did was bring us the bill!!!

This hotel was perfectly situated near tourist attractions and to many restaurants and shops making it really easy to get around and explore Bangkok. The pool is really nice and a good size and is kept very clean. The rooms were also really clean and replenished with bottled water every day.  Breakfast had a wide selection and was very good value for money.,5,0.9804

"This hotel was really quite good.  In a perfect location which is surprisingly quiet.  The onsite restaurant was also excellent with breakfast also being very very good.  The staff were good too.  However...  The two main flaws which make me prefer to stay at the Dang Derm are the most important. The bed was awful, I mean awful.  Both me and my partner left with bad backs. The noisy air con too, absolutely impossible to sleep but luckily bought ear plugs. Oh, and dont forget th mosque bang outside the hotel, you WILL get woken up at 4am as they want to advertise their religion with a microphone.",3,0.9167
"Hotel has some plus and negatives.   + great location  + comfortable clean rooms + roof top pool  -WiFi is awful!! - I would consider this hotel to have no WiFi, I needed WiFi so had to get a SIM card for my stay.  - pool was a little dirty at times and the loungers are not comfy  - the hotels shops bug you a lot - though as with every shop in Bangkok/ Asia not surprising but as it’s your hotel it would be better to have a little rest bite.   Staff are average - didn’t find them rude but didn’t find them amazing.   We stayed here twice, purely because of location and price. You get what you pay for and is a budget hotel. ",3,0.8005

Employees don't speak English well.  Ok bed and middle sized bathroom. The restaurant in front of hotel is really nice with variaty of dishes for breakfast. The location of hotel is great though! it;s 5 min walk from tha main road Khao San, but it is still very quiet and charming. The street where is hotel is full of trees and it has special atmosphere.

It's in the middle an area with a lot of restaurants (and streetfood galore)",3,-0.0767
So got to the hotel and we had an email from the site we booked with and we was upgraded which was good the room itself was quite nice the air con was abit loud and you can hear people in the corridor that’s if they are being loud.

"First of all I had to wait 1h in the middle of the night for my check-in, just to be told my Agoda Booking was not ""valid"" because I booked after 12 for the same day. So I had to pay a second night as a Walk-in Guest (of course at a higher price), even though I only needed 1 night. They also said my original booking would probably not be refunded due to ""cancelation policies"". A good Hotel would have cleared the situation and given me a room directly with little to no discussion, especially after a 12h Bus ride.   So at 4am I finally fell got to sleep, just to be woken up again at 7:15am by some receptionist and a tourist guide who wasn't able to do her job right, because it was meant to be for a complete different person (a female and I'm male).

Walkable to the 'loud' side and return for a peaceful sleep. + Fantastic breakfast spread. (6 am to 10 am). + Comfortable single room for single traveller with good A/C. + Close to a 7/11 + Great room service  - Rooms while comfortable maybe considered 'small' for some. Specially if you have multiple bags. - Small bathroom, less shower pressure. - No elevators in our block so we had to walk up 4 floors for the room.  Overall : For the price it's a good deal. The breakfast makes up for the small room. ",4,0.9688
"Basic, clean accommodation with good aircon and fridges in each room.  Good dining options close by and plenty of 7/11s and currency bureaus.  Plenty of taxis / took tooks immediately outside the hotel entrance but you'll need to haggle your fare because they won't use the meter!  Great roof top pool with adequate shade.  We rebooked for the end of our stay in Thailand.",4,0.9354

"Didn't have much of a plan for Bangkok, so didn't do a lot of hotel research and wasn't expecting much. This was a great for the price for sure and much better than expected. Great location too, on the north part of Rambuttri Road, right next to, and very similar to Kao San Road. Also quite a big place, with plenty of services and amenities available. Room was clean and big enough, not too noisy, no complaints. No shortage of places to eat (or touts) either, but also quite handily close to the Phra Arthit Ferry docks.",5,0.7433
"Whatever you do they try to get always money from you, they see you as a cash machine. Is the only hotel in Thailand where they did ask me for money if you want a guest in your room, if u want to leave the luggage after the check out, if you want a copy, anything. Added to that when I come back home they charge me other money and I still have to figure out for what. The staff at the reception is the most nasty I have ever meet. Truly suggest to keep away from this place, the rooms are poor, toilets become like a like after shower, u can hear all the noises from other rooms.",1,0.1548
"Two minute walk away from  Khao San Road, and away from that noise. The included breakfast was huge and very good. The bar had very good happy hour prices. The one meal I ate there was good and reasonable. Rooftop pool was huge with lots of lounges, but they were solid wood, with no padding.. Paying 1000 baht deposit for a plastic key card is kind of an annoyance. There is no elevator in the old part. Should be noted that there is a mosque next door, and of course they have no respect for broadcasting their propaganda over a loudspeaker throughout the early morning. Also make certain  to get a low floor room, as the pigeons on the roof are very noisy early in the morning. Having to long into the internet is a real pain in the butt",3,-0.6869
"Just a very short walk from the epicenter of Bangkok's backpackerville,  Khaosan Road, the Rambuttri is something of an icon for travelers seeking a neat, clean, somewhat basic, but economic accommodation option in Bangkok.

The hotel's adjacent restaurant offers only food of an average standard: recommend that it be avoided, and any of the 100's of local options be tried.",4,0.8779
Firstly the hotel is very dated and in need of a refurbishment.. looks not much like the photos. Internet barely works if at all.

"As a solo traveler, I picked the hotel due to its price and location - which are its major pros! The hotel was near to Khao San, bus stops, and Phra Arthit Boat pier. Hence, going around the area was not a hassle because you have many options either by bus or boat which are the two best options. Some taxis, and most tuktuks offer high prices as they know there's a lot of tourists in the area so beware of that. The hotel is also near Santi Chai Prakan park which was great for me because I could still jog everyday while in vacay.  About the room, it was decent for the price I paid.

We stayed here only for two nights and wouldn’t say any longer.  It was a great location being a couple minutes walk from the busy koh san with enough to see and do for a few days.  The room was small and the bathroom worked as a wet room meaning everything got soaked( including the toilet).  We didn’t eat here so can’t mention the food but the staff were friendly enough when we had a drink in the bar.  The poor area was big and had enough sun loungers but the pool was dirty with rough floor tiles.  For a few nights stopping over in Bangkok we enjoyed it for the price we paid.   Don’t expect luxury as it’s far from it but comfortable enough ,3,0.7814

This is a hotel with modern updated rooms and bad old tired rooms hence the title of the review. Given the location which is excellent if you get the modern room you've hit the jackpot you get the rooms we had and boy oh boy are they bad. Our room was small and grubby with holes in the sheets. The bathroom had openings near the ceiling covered in mesh which made the bathroom very hot and every noise could be heard in the corridor. It was a wet room with the shower almost above the toilet. AC worked but was incredibly noisy. We met another couple who had stayed at the hotel before but in the newer rooms and they were totally shocked by the state of their old room on this visit so much so they only stayed one night and moved to another hotel.

"Stayed here last December 2018 with my family (4 elders, 1 adult). It has a great location along Soi Rambuttri, the quieter street across Khao San Road (Soi Khao San). There are lots of restaurants, food carts, food booths, shops, convenience stores, money changers, etc. along this road which makes staying here very convenient -- very ideal for families who are ok to stay at this kind of accomms neighborhood.  What all of us loved the most at this hotel were its peaceful dining grounds (there's a small pond) and its buffet breakfast. The staff most especially at the dining area and kitchen were very efficient, attentive, and assistive; plates are quickly cleared out always. Food are always refilled whenever supply is needed.

This place was below a 3 star level.  From check in when you enter the hotel they have no AC and the employees are in a lobby but it's open air. If you are in the old tower which we were then the rooms are old the bathrooms face the hallway and the screen above the bathroom allows all the noise from the hallway in to the room and voice versa. The bath mat towel was so old it had bleach stains and shredded on the edges. The bed sheets had bleach stains or just worn parts couldn't tell.  The bed was hard and there's no elevator to the 2nd floor only to other floors. Staff was rude and scoffed at any requests or even questions asked.  Overall Bangkok sucked. People in general are not as nice as other places in Thailand. Luggage storage is 20 baht per bag per day In a smelly room.,2,-0.9568

There are two buttons in every room, where you can press every day if you want the room to be made or the ‘do not disturb!’ I adored the rooftop pool, very quite and pleasant place to spend a few hours in the afternoon. The hotel itself is very big and modern, breakfast area is lovely even though breakfast itself is basic.  Overall very happy with everything!

The breakfasts had a lot of food and it all tasted great. Those are all the positives, sadly. The promised equipment in the rooms (tv, hair dryer, fridge etc) seems to really depend on where exactly your room will be. Our room for 3 was smaller but big enough for a few days, with no storage space, only 2 small tables and 6 hangers. We did have a fridge, flat screen tv and a hairdryer. Our friends in a room for 2 had no fridge, much smaller room, no hair dryer, an old (not flat!) tv, and a much older, barely working AC.

The location was excellent which was very close to Khao san road and loads of restaurants and bars are close by. Staffs were kind and helpful and the pool was okay. Since I had worked as a tour guide myself, having enthusiastic and engaging guides was a top priority for me. We had fabulous guides in Luang Prabang, Ho Chi Minh City, and Hanoi- guides whose knowledge, passion, and personalities made their culture come to life.

"I used to stay at Rambuttri now many times over the years and so far I was mostly okay with the price / service ratio. This time I booked a Deluxe Double Room but I got a stinky little two bed room which was not what I payed for. Discussions with reception turned out negative (as always) and I was told that this is the ""right"" room. Very bad service attitude as I experienced a few years ago as well. The quality of the (non optional) breakfast also was more that of a fast food place. All that is okay when you visit Bangkok on medium-low budget, but it came to a point where there are many better value-for-money options in the vicinity . For me, that was the last try at Rambuttri. I guess they are just making money too easy and I hope that competition will regulate that over time",1,0.3634
