"The hotel and staff were fantastic! The whole place was spotlessly clean and very comfortable. I LOVED the location, it was perfect for my stay. And I loved that it is joined to a very well-run Irish themed bar that had huge sports screens and fantastic staff. A credit to both businesses working in partnership. Breakfast served here too which was also top-notch! Great memories and when in Bangkok I will certainly book here again! 10/10 :)",5,0.9914
I really enjoyed my stay there. It's a perfect location but yet quiet during the night.  The staff is always very kind and available.  I had a problems on the second night with the aircon and the technician arrived very fast and resolved the issue.  I am looking forward my next stay. ,5,0.8216
"This hotel is perfect. The room is a small apartment with kitchenette. It's in a redeveloping area which is fast becoming a hotspot for nightlife. The staff are very friendly, the pool is lovely. I will be staying here from now on when I'm in Bangkok.",5,0.8999
Guest service who has checked in me he is so nice all thing have prepare for us check in so fast because we went at late night ðŸ¥° also the price vey cheap and near at the club near 7-11 easy to find the feed ,5,0.7591
"Good length pool to cut laps pretty much in direct sun most of the day.  Pool towels provided.  The hotel provides an on demand  tuktuk service til 9pm to Nana BTS and limited service to Asok BTS / Sukhumvit MRT.  Very pleased with the overall service provided by reception and cleaning staff.  I had booked the Executive Studio, 1 Queen Bed, Kitchen expecting a bath however the first room put in did not have a bath.  Not all rooms will have a bath.  Location wise, you are close to lots of nightlife within easy walking distance.    I paid less than AUD80 per night.  Much better hotel then their hotel in soi 8 which I stayed in last year.",5,0.9286
"The last time I stayed here, it was like a dump but now, it is really very good. Took an advice from a friend and decided to stay here again after almost 4-5 years and no regret. First off, location is great along the party street of Bangkok.",4,0.9281
"Great property in a prime location. Comfortable and spacious with cold AC, strong Wifi signal and dedicated, friendly staff. Small pool on the roof and fun restaurant in the lobby round out an amazing experience with toiletries on-request and a free area tuk tuk.",5,0.9806
"Its located very conveniently close to the sky train that takes you one/two stops away to the city centre where all the malls are if you wanna shop. Located on Sui 11 its good for nightlife and exploring all suis you can get excellent food. The room had a kitchen, work desk, sitting area and was very clean and comfortable.",4,0.911
"This hotel has small rooms and 2/3 room appartments. The rooms and appartments are good, basic and adequate.The staff are very polite and helpful We arrived at 2am and they the people at the front desk were very happy to help u to our room. the beds are Asian type and a tad hard but everything else was good.The hotel does baggage storage at no additional cost which is very much appreciated. Location is easy walking distance to Nana station and Sukhumvit Rd. We have stayed here a few times and found it a very pleasant place to stay. noise can be a bit of a problem Soi 11 is a busy street.",4,0.9384
"Great Staffs Nice Location ( little far but with Free tuk Tuk )  front staffs were great during my stays . Nicely located with plenty of night life and restaurants . Room are clean , and nice sofa . Just need to improve on the bed . Internet free with limited speed.  happy with what we paid for &gt; Good Value",4,0.993
"I recently stayed at this hotel and I must admit that it was one of the best experiences Iâ€™ve had while vacationing in Bangkok. The staff was very professional, friendly and helpful! Rooms were meticulously clean and quiet. Thanks again!",5,0.9549
"Great location, near transport bars and malls, good size rooms clean and all requests from me were met quickly, check in was great let me check in very early, normal check in is 2pm I got to the hotel at 10:30am the room was available and I was allowed in with no extra charge. The room I was in was a bit noisy.",3,0.8979
"Excellent location for the areas i intended to visit , Soii 11 is a busy street and had some noise from outside , but the overall stay in the hotel was top notch , I could not fault it  The staff were polite and very courteous and the house keeping were very respectful to my wishes.",5,0.9563
"Over the last 7 years I'm staying at this property and call it as my home in Bangkok. Nothing much to say about Citadines as it's one of the property that might cater all types of travelers. Just look at my other reviews and pics to get more info. At last, thanks to Jenny once again for taking care of my reservation and keep up the service :) Gratitude towards management also :) ",4,0.9371
Glad to have chosen this apartment for my 3 nights stay in Bangkok. So clean and friendly staffs. Only that there is only 1 shuttle tuk tuk provided for.commute to nearest Nana and Asoke station. Will need to wait of more than 6 persons ,5,0.8576
"I have stayed in 2 citadines properties in last 12 months (3 visits). This one - stayed twice. Lovely hotel, lovely pool, clean and great location. Downside: if it's weekend and u r in lower floors - the noise from the pub and disco can be a problem. The food is ok with reasonably priced. My fav place to stay in Bangkok.",5,0.9287
"The staff were welcoming and friendly. Hotel is in a good location, walking distance from bars/restaurants and a train line. Room was a good size and had good amenities - kitchen, seating area, bedroom which could be partitioned off.  We didn't use the pool as it is tiny! We did not have breakfast included and so we paid for it one morning. It was not good. Although there was a good selection, the 'hot' food was all cold, bread was stale etc. I noticed people had made the same comments in previous reviews re cold food but thought we would give it a go in case changes had been made. They had not! Mullis Bar downstairs is nice and had reasonably priced drinks.",3,0.9335
"Situated just a few minutes walk from Nana BTS station, this hotel is a perfect choice for travellers who want to enjoy the Bangkok night life in a walking distance and who want to discover beautiful parks and temples of the city during a day thanks to BTS and MRT lines. ",5,0.936
"I have stayed at this location several times. Itâ€™s one of the nicest if you need to do work at Bumrungrad Hospital as the offer tuktuk shuttle service at any time you need to go there (unlike other hotels on Soi 11 that have a set schedule). To my surprise, last time when I returned from the hospital, they prepared a bowl of fruit with a get well card and delivered it to my room. What I appreciated more was their friendly smile and care every time I walked by the counter encouraging me that I was looking better each day. ",5,0.9778
Great place close to nightlife events.and local food store at night. Walking distance to many great night attraction and fun and there 2 night club near by LEVELED AND INSANITY. Different I will come back and bring more friends ,4,0.9254
"Nice room very spacious, rooms are clean, very nice staff, food is great, fast in check in and check out, nice place near malls,  comfortable, good location near malls , has standby taxi and tuktuk, everyday cleaning of rooms, has fast connection of wifi",5,0.9682
"This hotel has a really good location, its close to restaurants, bars, convenience store.The Staff is amazing and the rooms are really comfortable and with good space. I'll be back for sure on my next time in Bangkok.",5,0.944
The Citadines in Bangkok was fairly good value located in the heart of the Nana district and 1 few minutes walk away from the Nana station of the BTS.  One of the most outstanding factors of this place is the friendliness and service of the staff.  They were outstanding!,4,0.953
"The room and the bed are just so small for about 100 USD per night without breakfast. I requested for extra bed and it was not comfortable at all with an old, lumpy and flat pillow, and an old uncovered and lumpy duvet. I asked for a duvet cover, the receptionist told me that it was not available at that time and no options are given. I don't think it was true that they don't have available duvet cover. She could have told me it will cost me extra, I was willing to pay for it 'coz I wanted to sleep comfortably after a long trip. The place was quiet though, knowing it is surrounded by the nightlife. And the room was clean.",3,0.4585
"The good things about Citadines @ Soi 11 is relatively good location and it is always happening over there. Happening also mean it feel safe. The hotel also provided shutter tuk tuk to both BTS Nana as well as Terminal 21, which is very convenient as I am having most of my meals as well as daily usage shopping over the famous malls.  The not so good thing about this Hotel is for the same reason it is good. It is happening area. Thus depending on which room you take, facing which area. It might be noisy a bit at night. If you are used to happening places, then it is perfectly fine. I have zero issue with it.  The breakfast hardly changed over my 4 months stay there... which kind of boring. Luckily the coffee is okay for my taste (black and thick).  It is about 500 meters away",4,0.9739
"Huge and clean room. Overall amenities around was good as well. Plenty of food and 7-11 nearby. You will need to get a cab or Tuk Tuk to the nearest BTS, Asoke. Pub is available just right downstairs if you need to grab a beer.",5,0.8402
"The hotel location is nice, near shops and restaurants, located at the center of Bangkok. But loud noises on the street outside the hotel. The room looks like apartment room with fully amenities, has small kitchen and sink with a microwave oven, a toaster and an electric kettle.",4,0.6486
"1) Location near terminal 21. With shuttle service.  2) Noisy in the night.Too many bars around.  Not suitable for family with kids &amp; elderly too. Location very messy.. too many car around. 3) Room 804. The water pressure very slow , so did the hot water  need at least 14 mins for hot water. Is it high level ? 4) The best still the beds. And clean too. 5) Breakfast = variety . But ventilation need to improve.  6) Price too expensive.",3,0.7845
It's a very good place to stay in the heart of sukhumvit closer to NANA BTS from where many places are easily accessible by sky train. I have stayed twice in this same hotel and I would definitely come back again whenever I visit Bangkok for Business or Leisure. ,4,0.807
"Just stayed in this hotel for 6 days last week. At first, when I entered this hotel, no greeting from the staff although the check-in process is smooth. There is a kitchen in the room and the cooking stuff is adequate. Also, check-out process is smooth too. Overall, apart from the greeting, everything is quite good.",3,0.796
"The Citadines Sukhumvit 11 is located at Soi 11, with a wide range of pubs, bars and restaurants nearby. It is also within walking distance to Nana BTS. The staff are also very friendly and helpful and have attended to our needs promptly.",5,0.762
"Great Staffs with wholehearted support, transport facilities as well to roam around within a specific area and timeline, very quick response and delivery for every query, in a very strategic location!",5,0.8478
"I had a short stay in Citadines, which is part of the Ascott residential group.  The room was reasonably spacious with all the necessary amenities. No views but I have had worse in Bangkok. A washer dryer unit in the room would have been nice but there is a laundromat, for which you have to buy tokens, and it was cheaper than using hotel laundry. I did not swim in the rooftop pool and while not a lap pool, I liked the long rectangular shape, and it looked inviting. The tiny gym was adequate. The best part is that the hotel is located on Sukhumvit, which has many great restaurants, pubs, and bistros, and you are walking distance from all the action. I wish though I could have secured Ascott points through my Agoda booking, so that comprises a quibble.  Overall, recommended.",5,0.9719
"we came here as a family.. good location... but Noisy.. C@ll girls keep roaming inside the hotel.   not for family and only for Solo..  need to improve their service and should be polite to the customers.  Definitely, need improvement.",3,0.9239
"Wonderful find in Sukhumvit. Had a quick business trip so wanted to try this place at a very low cost. Was quite skeptical initially and thought - there must be catch behind this low price. Very impressed to see the room - it wasnâ€™t quite five star but they thought of everything - had safe, umbrella, slippers etc. I am definitely staying there again in the future. ",5,0.8297
"I stayed for 4 weeks, and this was the perfect place. Good value for the price you pay. Very service-minded staff, always willing to help and to give advice.  Good breakfast buffet if you do not want to prepare yourself in the kitchen, and also a good menu for lunches and dinner.  The area is full of bars and restaurants of different kategories, but I was not bothered with the noise at night.  Nice swimmingpool on the roof with a small gym.  Will go back if I return to Bangkok. ",5,0.9271
don't think twice... best place .. super clean ...  you are in the middle of all activities...very helpful and cooperative staff .they are ready to assist you without hesitation with big smile. excellent internet connection. loved my stay and indeed Citadines will be my choice every time i visit Bangkok.    thank you guys i really enjoyed my stay with you . ,5,0.9765
"So nice helpful room excellent, could of done with more storage space but it was not inconvenient, printed off boarding passes for us all part of the service. The pool on the roof is super. Mullis the bar next door part of hotel is also superb..",5,0.9237
"Clean, spacious and modern service apartment style rooms. Fully furnished with all devices/equipments in place; Never had to call the Room service  Rooms can be quite noisy when there is some activity in the lobby. ",5,0.204
I stayed at Citadines before and was very impressed by the staff friendliness and willingness to be helpful. The hotel was clean and the provision of it's tuk tuk for it's guests was most appreciated. ,4,0.9484
"Fully furnished flat, offering all the supplies that you will need. I was traveling for business so having an iron + table was just perfect. This is modern, recent and clean. Not too quiet as we are in the city center but thatâ€™s normal! For this price you wonâ€™t find anything like this around... ",4,0.7745
"We stayed in a two bedroom apartment for three nights.  We stayed in room 804 on the 8th floor and despite Soi 11 being a very busy street, we had no issues with noise.  The apartment was serviced each day.  We had breakfast included in our package which was served in the bar downstairs - there was a great selection of options.  The complimentary tuktuk to the BTS &amp; MRT was convenient, and the location just perfect.  We would definitely stay again.",5,0.9042
"I stayed different type of room with my booking. So next time will changed to other hotel. But facility was good, interior may be not enough maintenance, because it seems to older the conditions. never say anymore.",1,0.4404
"the citadine hotels in bangkok are always a good bargain. they all are very central and most of the rooms are quiet dispite the location in loud and living sukhumvit soi 11.   the rooms have a good size and they are very clean. the staff is nice and friendly even in peak times.   as said, location and and all other necessary facts like a pool, breakfast (is pretty ok), and cleanlyness make the citadine @sukhumvit 11 a real good cityhotel.",4,0.9726
Clean and well laidout compact room. Breakfast is 220 if not included in the room charge. Also there is a bar next door and can get frrelancers late at night. Both smoking and non-smoking rooms available. ,4,0.5859
"Overall good. Modern and clean. Efficient staff, good Wi Fi. Good sports bar on the ground floor. Would stay again at the right price. Very good position on Soi 11 where there are lots of great bars and restaurants.",4,0.9648
"First and last time staying there.  I contacted Ascott to ask if the hotel had quiet rooms as we have a 2 year old.  The Ascott team in Philippines responded in a reasonable time frame and put me in touch with the reservation team at Citadines Soi 11 and Somerset Soi 35 and neither one of them replied even up until now a week later.  I decided to try the Citadines Soi 11.  I requested a quiet room and a crib for the baby.  Upon arrival there were 4 females at the reception, none of which were smiling and none greeted us in the traditional Thai manner with smiles and politeness.  Normally in thailand this is standard as well as a courtesy and sign of respect.  They had no interest in the baby either which was a bit strange to see.  Not sure if any of them have been trained",1,0.8757
Very very good quality and service from staffs and the hotel. I will intend to stay here again and recommend this hotel to all of my friends. Incomparable comfort and the hotel in situated strategically in the most active and happening area. Cheers !,5,0.9513
"This was the second time i stayed in citadines. The room was clean, the staff was good as before. It felt like home. The only problem I had was the room view. This time i did not get the street view because of unavailability. However, i would still give 9 out of 10.",4,0.6597
"My first stay at this hotel but certainly not my last. Soi 11 is a great location as I have stayed on this street many times but this was my first time at Citadines. Room was large and clean. Excellent wifi speed and connectivity. Front desk provided outstanding service and the restaurant, Mullis was great. Food was good and the vibe was excellent. Lastly, the price was great. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for good value at a great location ",5,0.9965
The Music at Sport Bar can be hear at 6F. Safe doesn't work. House keeping lady is good. Breakfast Ticket only provide 1 person per room even the booking is for 2 persons. Water pressure is weak  sometimes,1,0.1779
"Having stayed here multiple times we are always comfortable and enjoy the location which is close to great restaurants, shopping and local transport by BTS . It is clean and quiet . Staff friendly and professional. We will stay again and the rates are always good value",5,0.9674
"Business/pleasure trip with my wife. We usually stay in or around Sukhumvit so decided to try Citadines. Location was good, room immaculate with excellent facilities and staff could not have been more helpful. Will definitely use this hotel for future trips.",5,0.9128
"I always have a great time staying at Citadines 11 in Bangkok. Awesome location, great service, and friendly staff. Rooms are big, comfortable and the pool, wifi and my are good. I have stayed many times before and I will be booking future trips there soon!",5,0.9719
"Citadines is a little gem.  Great location for many bars, shops and site seeing.  The staff are all very friendly and helpful.  The accommodation is effectively a studio apartment with living and sleeping areas separated by a sliding partition.  The kitchen is well equipped with twin hobs, microwave, toaster and kettle.  The place is new and well maintained, clean with good aircon.  I think it is also very good value for money and have no hesitation in recommending it.",4,0.9731
"I was surprised to see the entry level studio room being larger than expected! I was allocated level 7 -if this is the same size throughout the hotel? If it is, well it is a nice surprise as i have stayed in citadines soi 23 which the same room category semeed slightly smaller in size. Loved the cleanliness and the basic toiletries provided. Room service clean up seemed to start early at 7am. I could hear the vacuum cleaners. So if you are light sleeper or late riser you might not be pleased. One suggestion- If they could add one thin bathrobe to the room. Other a good stay in a lively area. ",4,0.953
"Â· The location was convenient and THAT IS EXACTLY WHY I chose the place. The staff was very polite and co-operative BUT THAT DID LITTLE TO RECOMPENSE for the failings.   Â· The one bed suite is described as 43sq m on the website - what it DOES NOT reveal is that the Bedroom is a pigeonhole, making movement difficult, and that the area is disjointed and awkward placing of the lounge makes the apartment unusable. Moreover, the WC and shower are two separate bathrooms, resulting in two tiny enclosures. One almost had no space in the WC. The windows couldnt drown out the BLARING MUSIC playing on the clubs opposite the street, and that went on till about 2 AM, resulting in 5 SLEEPLESS NIGHTS !",1,-0.835
"Stayed here for 2 nights and it was really good value for money. Its location near to the Nana BTS station made it very convenient to do shopping, eating, or go to other areas of the city. Public transport was readily available in the area. I stayed in a studio room which was quite clean and comfortable, and adequate for a couple or single person like myself. It was well equipped like other Citadines properties with a kitchenette and all the necessary typical in-room items such as cooking utensils, ironing equipment, etc. The WIFI service was also good. My room was situated right at the end of the corridor on the 4th floor, which was quite low and didn't really have much of a view except for the neighbouring buildings. Nevertheless it was very quiet and one couldn't hear much",4,0.9649
"Stayed their twice within a month can only speak for itself. Very professional helpful staff at all times ever smiling. Kudos to staff .. I forgot my sunglasses reunites with them 5 weeks later. Thanks for keeping them for me. I give them 5 stars. Clean , friendly , hospitable and respectful. Great restaurant food at reasonable pricing ",5,0.9758
"Booked the hotel as advised by a friend and found the hotel as good as told.   Location is excellent, executive rooms are spacious, amenities are enough, room service is good, beds are just right!   A big plus is Breakfast...good spread which am sure that it will satisfy everyone.   Staff are well behaved and helpful.   Good hotel to stay with family.",4,0.9753
"The room was. I remembered I'd splurged a bit but was surprised how nice my room was. Basically a 1 bed apt. Nice staff, street noise didn't bother me and I really enjoyed my stay here.  Nana BTS at the end of the street and convenient pubs, clubs, 7-11 and Villa Market for all your Western shopping needs.   Good doogs.",5,0.9684
"Well situated for bars, shops, the train etc this small yet professional hotel delivers. The staff were all friendly and helpful, the rooms are more than adequate and the bar/ breakfast room was very good although a little on the warm side and the breakfast was repetitive after a few days but again the staff made up for this with their friendly attitude.   There is a pool on the roof and a gym and they offer a free tuck tuck ride as well.",4,0.9465
Great spot. Hotel is not big but rooms are large and well equipped. Checkin was seamless and staff were very pleasant. I'm sure I will enjoy my stay. Hotel is close to bars and restaurants definitely I will consider this hotel again,5,0.9694
"Booked the accomodation despite mixed reviews, any lingering doubt were soon put to one side. The arrival and check in process was quick, friendly and efficient. Our room exceeded our expectionals, it was clean, comfortable and well maintained. Soi 11 is very busy but there is something for everybody there. We would certainly stay there again.",5,0.836
"Absolutely for my attention this here doesnâ€™t make us disappointed and down I much reading the reviews and found that this hotel is peaceful and calm. I felt appreciate to Dave he is good manager and good acting his duty He helped us to complete our trip and rapidly responded what we need to.

"My partner and I have stayed at the Citadines serviced apartments in Soi 8 and 11 many times and our experience is always fantastic. We love the location as they are close to restaurants, street food, nightlife and it's easy to get transportation by taxi or BTS training. ",5,0.8934
"Booked 6 nights, moved out at my cost after two, only because i couldn't book anywhere else quicker. Pool, very small, rooms even smaller, noisy from the road, but don't worry ear plugs supplied! pigeons sitting outside the window creating the mess they do. I am well traveled, Hilton to Travelodge,  Hotel nights around 50-100 per year.  I would say, do not stay here. Good points, bar great, washing facilities good, free tuktuk down the road.",1,0.9523
"We booked 2 bed-room suit.  One of the room is double bed and the other is 2 single beds. Two toilets and bathrooms for this room type.  It is suitable for family. - spacious and strong air-conditioner. - relatively clean and decorated. - the water temperature of the bathroom inside master room is not enough hot. - the air conditioner of the 2 single bed room is little bit noisy at mid night - pillow is too soft, not enough to support the neck.  The bed is ok. - self service laundry equipment at the top floor, need to buy token first.  The staff will give you detergent together with the token.  It takes 1 hour to wash and 45 mins to dry. - free shuttle available to Nana Station or Asok Station. - buffet breakfast THB 120 per person. - traffic jam at weekend night outside hotel",4,0.8631
Nice clean rooms.  Friendly helpful staff.  Mullins has good food and nice place to meet friends for a drink to start your night.  Also the small rooftop pool is nice and quiet easy to relax up there in the afternoons,5,0.9796
"The Hotel is very centrally located at Sukhumvit, Bangkok, within easy reach of most places. We stayed in a two bed-roomed air-conditioned service apartment with drawing room, two toilets, tv, fridge, free wifi etc. Excellent buffet breakfast was offered every morning , where the spread was mind boggling. Service was super excellent. Lovely roof top swimming pool.",4,0.9726

"Citadines 11 is a small hotel located on soi 11 of sukhumvit road, the business area of Bangkok with nice hotels and a lot of tourists. It's a 5 minutes walk to the nearby bts station Nana. During the day there is even a very convenient free shuttle service.All the staff are very friendly and helpful . They try to make your stay as pleasant as possible and have respect for your privacy. The rooms are very clean,well maintained and have everything you need even for a longer stay. There is a kitchenette with all appliances, a microwave, internet and a tv with international channels.",5,0.9603
"The hotel is surrounded by several pubs and clubs, perfect stay for night life lovers. Stayed at level 2 of the building, was worried about the noise from outside would transmit. However, we were lucky that it was not weekend, so the sound ok.   Room is spacious, but toilet is a bit too compact. ",3,0.679
"stayed here June 28th to July 8th. arrived early so payed extra half day to check into room. room pictures look way bigger than in real life, paid for an extra bed as we had 3 adults. a bit cramped but it worked. room # 516 first which was a non-smoking room but later got the room that we wanted #616 which was a smoking room.  they provided a book on how to operate devices and such but only found that after by accident. would've been better if was told about that prior. it was awesome as it was in English. the beds were on the firm side which was comfortable. AC worked very well. but need to be in front of it as it seems like its being changed but not. the window opened but not close well, but didn't matter. noise level is not that bad considering at night you can see the main",4,0.9747
Great location with bars and restaurants close by. Easy access to public transport. Modern and clean. Good front desk staff. Swimming pool on rooftop and Irish pub on the ground floor. Easy walking distance or taxi to many of the big hotels for conferences or functions.,5,0.9382
"Citadine sukhamvit 11 is a centrally located place and that i found as an advantage only for 2 reasons. One that there are variety of Indian restaurant s close by and also terminal 21 mall is at walking distance. Apart from this there is nothing that would make me  go back there. The hotel is on a very busy street of sukhamvit that doesn't sleep, so if you wish to sleep at night then this is definitely not the hotel for you.It's very disturbing to sleep at night as there is a lot of noise there, some wierd motorcycle roar that goes on throughout the night. Beds and pillows are very hard that made sleep on them very inconvenient.  We were in an apartment which was nice and clean, it had basic utensils a microwave and a fridge and a hob, super market s are near by so it's easy to",2,0.9055
"We really loved the hotel Crew are very supportive and lovely  Every was close to as: halal food, super markets and transportation  The room we stayed was quite and nice for relaxing  Food was good for Muslims but need little bit improvement ( more choices)",5,0.9432
"Serviced apartments are something of a Bangkok specialty for me.  They do it best.  This one is located in its own neighbourhood, with its own nightlife.  You are within walking distance to restaurants and if you are brave, street food.  Basically a little world of your own.  The apartments are getting old: the televisions do not slide across from bedroom to sitting room with ease, but overall - still a great place to live in when I come to Bangkok.  The fact you have a kitchenette means you get to buy fruit to eat, and prepare/reheat your late night noodles.  Great convenience!",4,0.9592
"The space is perfect for couples or single travellers mainly because of the location. It's close to noce spas and Oskar's which is a good place for dinner and drinks. Rooms are quite basic, but spacious and clean.",4,0.7814
"Have been to Bangkok on many occasions, tried this hotel on the recommendation of a friend, the room was only 3 star, the bed was so hard on the first night, asked for a topper which made it more bearable. The AC in the room was smelling of mould, the breakfast was cold unless you ordered the omelette which was great. Level of speed on cleaning the room was slow all day,  Unless your travelling on a budget and trying to save money this is not a great option in my opinion.",3,0.9292
Very friendly Staff and give a smile back if you give them one ;o) Rooms very good and the Pool also good for swim and relax.  Near restaurants and 7-eleven and near to BTS Nana. Will come agaain... See you,5,0.9358
Very value for money and suitable for family with kid as it has full equipped kitchen which you can cook for baby. Staff is friendly and helpful during our stay.  Hotel is well designed and pool is lovely.Thank you Beer and whole team again for making our stay memorable. Location is great too as The Super Market - Villa Market just few step from hotel which offer full range of food which is much more convenient to Big C. 7 Eleven is available and Coffee Club Restaurant near by the hotel is really nice.,5,0.9678
I was looking for a budget hotel in Sukhumvit. This room was very nice compare to its rent. If you are Ascott member; youâ€™ll get better deal.  Was also specious and clean. Couldâ€™ve said best if they take bit more care of their floors and  door locks.  ,4,0.9467

"I was very happy with this property. It is conveniently located near the main road. The BTS stations are within walking distance. I booked the one bedroom unit. It was spacious and clean. The pool, gym and laundry room were nice on the roof. My only complaint was the bathroom. You could see where the original bathroom had a small basin, the toilet and the open corner for the shower. The shower was removed and moved across the hall into a separate room with a full bathtub and full size sink basin with mirror. The problem was with the toilet. To make room for the old shower, the toilet was tucked into the corner of the room, against the wall. When the shower was removed, the toilet was not relocated to the center of the wall. A larger sliding wood door was installed as part of the",4,0.7841
"I stayed 5 nights in Citadines 11. Late checked in and I had requested for late check out during booking, in special requests, over chat and on check in. Still was not completely accommodated. This hotel has nothing to shout about except its location, which is in the heart of the bars and parties. However, if you intend to sleep at night, forget about it. Surrounding area is super noisy all night long and windows are not sound insulated.   Talking about staff, have known Thai people for their humble and helpful nature, this was a disappointment. Receptionists are not welcoming, No smile, no greetings, not helpful, rather rude. I have stayed in Bangkok hotels many times over the years and this would be first time I find  such robots like receptionists. Though, can't complain of",2,0.9195

"Be really cautious when booking this property if you are reaching little early than their check-in time... especially Indian.  Really bad experience with the receptionist, deliberately not providing us a room even from our repeated requests..... since the hotel rules is there that the checkin time is 2 pm.   We have a booking of 3 rooms x 3 nights. And we reached the hotel by 8 am and she was in a hurry to do our checkin formalities within 5-10 minutes of our arrival and asked us to wait at the lobby(no point of doing this procedure if staff decided to provide room strictly accordance with the rule). Even many humble  repeated requests were denied we decided to go out by 11.30 &amp; return back reception by 1pm &amp; asked; still she didnt have the mercy to give at least one room. But",2,-0.8205
"I stayed here twice in April/May and the reason I didn't give 5 stars are as follows;  On first stay the room was tiny and for a regular traveler I would have expected a better room , or even an upgrade the amount of times I stay here, and when I asked why I was given one of the single rooms when I had paid for a double I was told the hotel was full and they would provide a better room when I returned. On my second stay the room was better and on the 8th floor which I like as its close to the pool. This brings me to my second and final gripe. The mats on the sunbeds are worn out and need to put in the bin. Please replace them!!  Everything else was fantastic as usual.

"Despite all the bad reviews I have seen online, I surprisingly had quite a good experience while staying here.  This hotel/apartment offered a cozy home away from home while travelling Bangkok.   I also like the fact that the housekeeper did not knock on the door early in the morning just to make the bed or clean the room.   Location is also good, and it's within walking distance to Nana station. The entire stretch of road was filled with a good mixture of street food and foods from other cultures. Quite a melting pot.   The room though while is okay, some of the designs or placement of things were rather peculiar. Having a washbasin outside the bathroom is rather an odd choice of design.   Room was also fitted with essentials, television set and all, however, there's only one",3,0.9585

"It takes about 10 minutes to get off from NANA. Itâ€™s just that the road is not good. The luggage is very difficult to pull. Although there is a bit of poor communication during the check-in, thank you for letting us stay directly, save the trouble of carrying luggage, you can put the luggage first. Go back to the room to go for a run, there is a living room with a small kitchen, there is a shower and a bathtub, but the water level in the shower needs to wait for five minutes to subside. The bed is really good to sleep, always makes people want to bed, the small kitchen really Very convenient, my friend has been using the bartender, and the instant noodles have been cooked on the last night.

I had some questions and she went above and beyond to accommodate my stay. Another young lady is Iya. She is guest service officer. She helped me with laundry service. I don't know how there service works but my laundry was taken care of. On my days that I explored the local neighborhood, the language was hard and I didn't know the area. There is a young man who name is Somnuek. He pointed out all the arras to stay out of as some areas of the neighborhood is shady. The crew at Citadines Sukhumvit 11 Bangkok made my stay welcoming.

We received the loudest room.The music from the bars and clubs was until 4 o'clock in the morning!!!

Excellent clean hotel. Hassle free check in. Small pool pon top floor was ok for a 'dip'. Attached to a bar which was good value. Plenty of other eateries and drinking establishments around in Soi 11. ,5,0.9517
"Booking via Ascott membership gives discount.  Location is great as Soi 11 is getting more popular.  Lots of push carts, 7-11s, and eating places/pubs open past midnight.so its great if you are nocturnal.  You have to put up with bit of muffled noise from drinking places and traffic even way past early hours though. Room is 30sqm and can comfortably fit in extra folding bed.  Well maintained and clean.   Hotel is located 400m away from Nana BTS so its very convenient.  There is also complimentary tuk tuk to bring you to Nana BTS or Terminal 21.
