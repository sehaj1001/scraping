"Amazing hotel, huge and very clean rooms. Nice view and kind staff. Pool is a bit tiny, but the view from there is amazing too!   Breakfast was very good. I don't have anything bad to say about this hotel. Rooftop bar is very nice too.",5,0.9798
"Great hotel for the price! The location is good, close to everything you need including transit. The pool is clean and has wonderful views of the city. The staff are super friendly. Will stay again when in Bangkok!",5,0.9686
"We had a pleasant stay at the Hyatt. Location is great, breakfast quality is very good. Staffs are friendly, smiling and helpful. Clean rooms. Elevators are fast with almost no wait time at any given time of the day. Reception staff are one of the friendliest of many places we stayed in Thailand. Great job guys!!",4,0.9829
"Our entire experience at this hotel was OUTSTANDING!  Words can't express how happy we were with our stay here.  It was a pleasure to meet Mr. Edd, the general manager, during our stay.  From the staff, to the room, to the hospitality, everything was fantastic.  The abundance of breakfast items is a great way to start your day, too!  Every day was something different and it's delicious, too!  The hotel is in a great location, as well.  The BTS and a big mall are right around the corner and it's easy to get around via various modes of transportation.  We now know where we'll be staying when we're in Bangkok.  Mr. Edd and his staff have made a lasting impression on us!  Thank you so much, for the WONDERFUL stay! ",5,0.989
"I stayed for a night last week for a short business trip, checked in at 7.30pm, checked out at 9am.   It was the first time I experience Hyatt Place, where I think Hyatt positions it as a Aloft/Ibis Styles type of products. The check in counter is blended with a small all day dining cafe/bar counter and a 24/7 grab and go section. I found interesting that they is a list a amenities printed out on the check-in counter, so that the guest can get them to the room, which is a bit like the Japanese Toyoko-Inn's style. I took the disposable shaver kit which is a nice touch for this class of the hotel.  There is no room-service provided, instead, you can go down to lobby to buy sandwiches or snacks at the grab and go section, or order some simple food at the cafe bar. Guests can also",4,0.7096
My family came back to the Hyatt Place as we had such a great experience last year. They took great care of them and we had an upgrade given to us for a larger room on a higher floor. The customer service was excellent and the room was clean and comfortable. ,5,0.9686
"Stayed here for a week and was quite comfortable. The only thing I found odd was that the TV was mounted on the side of the room and at an odd angle that was really no good for viewing. Minor issues that won't matter if you're just staying a couple of days, but still worth considering if you're into this sort of thing. Service was great, and so was breakfast. Chef Aun deserves a mention for his cheerful demeanor and excellent service at the omelette station. ",4,0.9643
"Lovely hotel for families with all the comforts of home including a pool and 24 hour gym!  Can't say enough about the gym - it's quiet and functional and most important of all, open 24/7 - love it. We had an early morning tour and they packed nice box breakfasts for us - very accomodating and thoughtful.  The location is good and complies with our rule - anywhere we stay in Bangkok must be within five minutes of the BTS station. It's a five minute walk to Emporium Mall so just meets our criteria.  The breakfast buffet is above average. The service at the egg station was excellent - very cheerful and efficient. One small critique - the latte machine and coffee beans could be improved.",4,0.9879
"Although this is supposed to be one of the more budget-friendly Hyatt brands, this hotel has better service than most of the 5-star high end ones. The hotel is small, but extremely clean and the service is some of the best I've had. Every staff member is so friendly and helpful and they work hard to make you feel special and welcomed. The rooftop bar is also a really cool way to see the city, plus they have a pool with a beautiful view and an actually very good fitness facility. We stayed at a hyatt regency after our stay here, which is supposed to be 5-star, but the Hyatt Place was honestly much better in every way and I wish we could still stay there.",5,0.9956
"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay.  The hotel was modern, clean and conveniently located.  The service was top notch and I felt I was just as important as any other guest.  Ordered food a few time and it was solid too.  I would absolutely stay there again and I recommend to anybody who will be spending time in Bangkok.",5,0.8999
"We stayed here for a personal holiday for about 9 days.  We were welcomed with smiles upon arriving for check-in. Our room Standard King with Sofa Bed was spacious, clean and modern.  Everyday we went for hotel brekkie and staff were always smiling and happy to help. During not so busy times of brekkie service, the staff were keen to engage in conversation with us and also to recommend places.  House keeping always kept our room clean and neat and tidy after arriving back at the hotel at the end of each day.  We had an opportunity to use the gym and pool. Both are not big, but sufficient enough for holiday use and were not crowded when we stayed there.  The check out process was easy and straight forward.  Overall we had an enjoyable stay at Hyatt Place and would recommend",5,0.9856
"Our room was both spacious and clean! We enjoyed our stay in our scenic hotel, with a comfortable bed! This hotel was perfectly located near the bts and local fun adventures. We would love to return soon! ",5,0.9758
"My first time stayed at Hyatt hotel and I’m made the right choice of the stay because I’m satisfied with the room and the hotel. Well, Hyatt Place located just right at the golden triangle of Sukhumvit with 2 shopping malls connected with BTS Phrom Phong station. From the station, it just about 3 mins walk to the hotel, good location.   And the reception during check in staff very friendly and staff offered me room with breakfast even though I booked the room without the breakfast. Room is extremely clean and bed really comfortable, room amenities is satisfied. WiFi connection is strong and staying at highest floor we able to see the view of Bangkok.  Hotel breakfast is perfect with variety of choices.   And also, hotel with rooftop Aire Bar, nice rooftop ambience and drinks in",5,0.9826
This was my first stay at the HP for 2020.  I will be staying here again during my next trip to Bangkok in April 2020.  I am usually in BKK every other month. Each trip I plan to stay at the HP.  It is located near the BTS and the Emporium shopping complex which also has many restaurants and a supermarket.  Also there is a Superrich green money changer in the Emporium.  The entire staff of the HP provide superior service.  I am usually upgraded to a Vista room which has a fantastic view.  Breakfast at the Galley is also fantastic.  Both Western and Asian food is offered.  Menu is changed daily.  You cannot go wrong staying here.  The price is right!,5,0.9266
"This hotel was very clean and a convenient location to the skytrain. The pool and workout areas are small, but both are nice. Breakfast includes several options. The lady who cooks the made to order omelettes is very efficient and they taste great! The rooftop bar/lounge has a spectacular view and is a nice area to enjoy time in the evening for sunset. ",5,0.9771
"For a Hyatt Place, this is one of the better ones. However, as a 4* hotel, it is fine.  Although they were efficient and professional enough, the check in agent was not as friendly as others at the many Hyatts I have been to. One of our rooms was not ready even when we showed up past 3 pm checkin time. The agent was trying her best to help us check in to one room but this was still an issue that I never expect at a Hyatt.  Room was well appointed, clean, and nice. The pool was very nice and tops most of the Hyatt hotels in the world.  Breakfast was amazing for a Hyatt place. There were many options, hot and cold, buffet and made to order eggs and noodles. The food quality was good. There was a line and the staff tried their best to help. However the seating and queuing system",4,0.9924
"Comfortable and pleasant hotel, I certainly like the place since it is working well. Breakfast is simple, they could provide a few more options but in general all you need. Coffee is not that good.  Location is very convenient close to BTS",4,0.4924
"This is a great little hotel, in the heart of BKK.  I had a corner room looking over the park and the city on Level 32. Just magic view and a very good sized room for the price.  The staff were excellent and very happy to assist with any requests.  Breakfast was also very good.   I had a lovely relaxing swim in the pool with a great view.   Also had an evening drink in the open air bar - very classy.   I like the location as you are just a short walk from the Skytrain, Underground and emporium shopping centre.  There is a Starbucks, and street food on the corner...what more could you want.   Oh and a really classy herbal massage place just down the street.   Not a big street presence, but everything you need.  I would definitely stay here again.",5,0.9741
"I am a WOH Hyatt member and have stayed at this property numerous times.  This time however, they have exceeded all expectations.  The room was spotless and the staff were great as usual.  Everyone remembered our names.  Needless the say, the location was awesome and the price unbeatable.  Have been to Bangkok so many times but Hyatt Place Bangkok keeps pulling us back!!",5,0.6892
"The stay was great! We were extremely pleased with everything. The location is great. We would love to have a welcome drink upon our arrival!  Thank you for the entire friendly team on location, very professionals.  ",5,0.9773
What was a brief layover stay turned out to be a quite nice experience. Very friendly and accommodating staff. Nice rooftop bar with a beautiful view. gym could be a bit bigger but still gets the job done. ,5,0.7679
Pity the pool is small; gym is good; didnt know about breakfast as New Year period was always queuing up; very close to BTS and Emporium; parking facility wasgood but be prepared for lead time to have your car machined-operated from the basement parking. ,4,0.4019
"During Xmas stay here for 4 nights. Location very Good close to BTS, Shopping Mall, Spa and Number of Restaurants   The room on the higher floor with nice view. Staff there with friendly service.   Will back again!",5,0.8685
Excellent location next to Emporium/EmQuartier Malls and BTS Station... lots of great dining options. Efficient and New Hotel! I would definitely stay here again and would recommend to friends. Try the pool too.,4,0.9595
"An enjoyable stay at the hotel, with quiet rooms despite the large crowd over the Christmas period. Clean room with excellent service. Location is fantastic, which is away from the maddening Siam area, in the generally cleaner and slightly less hectic Sukhumvit. ",5,0.886
"The location of the hotel is pretty near to to BTS, unfortunately there is no convenient store around the hotel. The room is comfy and nice,very clean.Staffs are friendly ,swimming pool is small. The Roof Bar is pretty nice to relax and have a night drink.",4,0.8934
"Great stay in Bangkok in Hyatt Place. Personnel is friendly and helpful. Hotel is almost new, clean and in decent shape. There is a rooftop pool with nice views, but we haven't used it. Breakfast buffet is also rich and decent. ",5,0.9195
New and walkable distance to Emporium. The exit is small so you may not notice it when you pass by. Reasonable price and tasty breakfast! Lighting in the room may not be bright enough for some people. ,4,-0.4015
"Rooms were very spacious although could improve on having more lighting. Very near BTS, Emporium and EMQuartier malls. Staff were very attentive and apoke good English. Enjoyed the breakfast every morning.",5,0.8442
Will come again hopefully i can travel to Bangkok every year and recommend to friends for this hotel and I would strongly recommend to have drink and relax at the 28 floor skybar nice night view you can see the whole of Bangkok.  ,5,0.9485
"Spent a week in this affordable but excellent hotel for business. It was hassle free as usual. As a Hyatt member, perks are making it convenient for business travelers. Early check in, free breakfast and room upgrade. Hotel front desk staff are super friendly. Room is always clean, comfortable bed and location is great. Highly recommended and will return in couple of weeks.",5,0.9922
Very small rooms and very limited food options no restaurant and no other activity options except gym it’s not at all Hyatt experience . They have got small swimming pool on 19th floor which is only for 15 pax . It’s just a budget hotel . ,3,-0.6801
"Arrived 2 days ago and honestly didn't know what to expect. Here for 2 weeks and booked an amazing rate on Hyatt .com 6 months ago. As retirement looms trying to go more on a budget so Hyatt Place seemed a good bed. We have been Hilton fans for years but they just seem to cut corners and it finally became too much so we moved this time to Hyatt across the street. Needed have worried. Check in was smooth and friendly. Room had impeccable housekeeping. Breakfast is high quality and the young gentleman, the Domletter lady and young staff in general are welcoming, friendly and helpful. Yes, pool area is small but both days I got a chair. The gym has a cardio room with 7 machines and a weight room with absolutely everything you need. Lots of TV channels including French which I use",5,0.9652
"Stayed here for ten nights so I was able to really experience this hotel.  Early check in was available for an extra 1000 baht.  When you first arrive you are of course on G (ground) level . You have to take the elevator up to the lobby, luggage carts are available.  Check in was fast and efficient. Everything was explained and they assigned my room. They take a 1000 baht deposit for incidentals. I had requested a higher floor which I received.  The room was great, very clean and the air con worked well. The pillows, sheets amenities were up to standard. TA, the lady who cleaned the room and changed towels noticed that I drank the coffee everyday and she made sure to replenish it - even leaving an extra one. Instant coffee is not that great but in a pinch will do and using two",5,0.8499
"Enjoyed the stay very much. Brief walk to food courts at 2 major malls, BTS station and great street food.  Friendly staff, clean and comfortable rooms, Refreshing water at check in desk in non plastic cups.  Basic, but functional gym with sufficient dumbbells.  Wonderful breakfast selection.  ",5,0.9267
Would be much better if the light in the room is brighter as it's too dim. Breakfast to serve more hot dishes. Breakfast area where the food are placed is too small and narrow. Plenty of fruits selection and they have vegetarian counter. The aircon in the room seem to turn off in the middle of night and we felt warm.,4,0.7506
"What we like and dislike about this hotel.  LIKE :  1. Distance to BTS is near 2. 2 shopping center very near 3. Staff are Great,Hotel is clean and upkeep  4. Bed and pillow are good stuffs  Dislike : 1. No street food nearby  2. Traffic Jam  3. BTS also Jam at this station  4. Not much choices for food nearby except Japanese food and Japanese food again.  5. No bath tub  6. Swimming pool is small and cold 7. Buffet breakfast is limited choice(maybe due to the size of the restaurant)  My room is 'view Speciality room' on the 32th floor and my view is awesome.  I was able to check in very early at 11am. Hotel provide different types of pillows like Hilton.  Nearby hotel are Hilton/Marriott/Doubletree/Westin/Sheraton and its near to Terminal 21(just 1 station away) Though from",5,0.8143
"I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights and we had our complementary drinks coupon when we arrived. The location of this hotel just few minutes walk from BTS station, which easy to locate. Room is clean, free breakfast is packed of people from 7:30 till 9sih in the morning. The pool is a bit small with a view thou. The staff offers excellence service, when I can't contact the restaurant (not in this hotel) to make reservation and they offered to help us to make the call. Thank you for making me and my friends feel welcome and I will stay here again when I visit Bangkok again. ",4,0.9729
"Conveniently located near BTSB, 8mins walk. Breakfast is fantastic, huge variety of foods. Staff are friendly and helpful. Good massage outlets are available nearby.  Cons. Could be a long wait during peak hours. ",4,0.93
"Situated in a not so busy part of Sukhumvit, this is a standard hotel offering quite comfortable amenities. 7 eleven across the road, 5 min walk to Emporium mall. Friendly front desk staffs. Their free light breakfast is adequate, there's also an ala carte options as well.   Minor points because not many street food around &amp; a bit away from ""attractions"". Their standard pillows are too soft, probably there's a pillow menu available but we arrived late in the evening  and had to check out early next morning.  We will consider to return anytime we'll find ourselves visiting BKK in the future. Thank you.. ",4,0.8688
"Perfect location to BTS and taxis to other shopping areas less than USD8. Many spa and restaurant options nearby, less than 30mins walk from Thong Lo.  Room is very clean and spacious with basic amenities. Breakfast spread meets expectation.  Overall, great value for money.",4,0.9216
Stayed a few nights in December and found this place to be convenient and the stay was pleasant. Rooms were clean and comfortable and breakfast spread fairly good. The gym was adequate although outdoor pool kinda small. Service staff were generally quite nice. Would stay again!,4,0.9476
"Was Ok, but there was a few frustrations:  - The lifts you have to change to get to my room  - check location and set up a little all over the place (had like a food serving table behind it.   - room was long and skinny which is fine buit the TV in weird spot.    Conceirge guy was a superstar organising a driver for my meeting on there 'uber equivalent app'    Breakfast too pokey, too busy. need bigger space",4,0
"The location is good, only 5 minutes walk to BTS station. I arrived at the hotel earlier than the check in time, the staff was very nice and helpful. The facilities and amenities were very good.  The room is big for one person to stay, what out of my expectation was I got upgraded, king size bed and one sofa bed ! Highly recommended!",5,0.9278
"This hotel was my home for almost 5 weeks on business in Bangkok. It was good in all respects except that it has inadequate breakfast provision for a hotel of this size. It is very near lots of restaurants and shops as well as a station of the Skytrain. Most importantly of all, the hotel staff are all wonderful.",4,0.8718
"Excellent choice for business traveler or holiday maker wanting to stay in the middle of Bangkok's busy Sukhumvit area.  All needful close by, transport close by. Room and hotel facilities sin very good order. Personnel - well they were Thai and that means friendly and helpful! :)",4,0.9467
"This is purely a business class hotel at sukhamvid mostly covered by Japanese. Good quite hotel with a small pool and a small skybar. An Indian tourist should not prefer it as this is far from most markets and shopping points. No indian restaurant nearby and one or two massage centre closely. Good breakfast with common rice and noodles as veg options only else fruites and eggs are other options, Offered free for hyatt members. I was given room at 14th floor with window facing other building so useless. Dont know who else are offered higher rooms with some view. ",4,0.5079
"Convenient place to stay if you don't stay much in the room. Of course when you're in Bangkok it's better that you tour around. Clean and comfy room.  They don't have room service but you can order food. The meals price are affordable and have good taste.  So far, its a decent place to stay. ",4,0.7684
"pro: location is good, hotel staffs are all friendly and helpful con:the air con is very noisy especially when one tried to get some sleep, other than that, everything else is great would consider to stay here again in the future",4,0.9002
"Totally loved my stay here. I think generally, Thai people are genuinely caring and sincere with regards to their service - this deserves a huge mark. As for the hotel, the façade looks cool as you would need to go up 1 floor before you can check in, which normally, located in the ground floor. Breakfast buffet could be improved though. Moreover, when it comes to the room, as usual, super comfortable, the bed, pillow, blanket - top notch! The only thing I think could be improved is the shower room interiors such as the tiles. Some people mind the shower a tranquil place and other Hyatt hotels has better bathrooms. Over all, definitely worth the stay.",4,0.9881
"I would highly recommend this hotel. Hyatt hotels are always my 1st choice! Customer service is amazing, check in process very smooth quick and efficient. Check out was quick. They even helped me get a taxi.",5,0.8653
"The location is good. About 300 m from Phrom Pong BTS   Staff is superb. Nothing is too big or small. Sometimes they appear understaffed, e g at the time of breakfast or room clean up. Service is always with a smile though.  Breakfast is basic but adequate. Could have little more variety. Breakfast area is small and it fills up quickly. May have to wait on line for a table.  Bathroom is very basic like a 3 star hotel. However, everything is adequate, neat and clean.  Plenty of eating, shopping and massage options near the hotel. Can get your currency exchanged at Superrich, Emporium which has good rates.  Tip - take the corner room, it costs a little extra but totally worth it. We stayed in room 2601  The check in and check out was a breeze. Very quick and efficient.",4,0.9858
"Stayed at this property for 2 nights. This is a relatively new property built in 2017. It is in excellent condition, superbly maintained. Cleanliness across lobby, restaurant, rooms, corridors, health club, swimming pool is spic and span. Wifi is very good. Rooms are nicely carpeted, absolutely clean and without any stench or odour. Very good double bed with soft pillows, clean bed sheets, clean towels and cleaner bathroom. Twin beds are also of very good size. Large sized LED TV, though channels are limited. Pool is on the 19th floor. It is not too large, but good enough. The hotel is very close to Phrom Phang BTS. Staff at the reception are also very welcoming. Overall, an excellent property.",5,0.9818
"This hotel was recommended by some friends who visited earlier this year.  Customer service is off the charts good—if they gave 6 stars, this team earned it—front desk, bellman, housekeeping, the Atria—all bent over backwards to make our stay perfect. Front desk crew was helpful 24/7 in meeting any need—we checked in at 0100 and were greeted with a smile and answers to all our immediate questions.  We booked our tours thru the hotel and they were incredible.  We upgraded to a specialty King with a view and the view was spectacular.  Located in the heart of a commercial district where boundless shopping and restaurants were within walking distance—must check out the Emporium.",5,0.9325
Great stay. We were welcomed very nicely and sent to our rooms. Everyone was accommodating and friendly.  Dinner on the rooftop was great !  All in all I have no complaints with any portion of our stay!,4,0.9284

"Very kind staff and a perfect service, coupled with a perfect location, make our decision a perfect choice to spend some days in Bangkok for a family holiday. Highly recommended, even for longer stays. Many spots around at walking distance as well and ver well located to take MRT",5,0.9712
"Customer service is exceptional and a big thanks to Pang at the reception.  After checking in, we noticed that our iPad was lost either on the plane or at the passenger lounge before we left our hometown.  We were unable to get to the right contact to report this issue from the airline website.  Feeling despair, we asked for help at the reception.  Pang was there and without any hesitation, she asked us to take a seat first and she helped in contacting the airline and finally located our lost item.  She gave us all the information about the location of the Lost and Found office as well as the opening hours. This trip was also for our wedding celebration and we received a card from the hotel and got upgraded to higher floors for a better view.  I don't expect anything would be",5,0.5739
"My husband and I stayed in this hotel this week for 2 nights as part of our 8 day G Adventure tour of Thailand. A G Adventure mini van taxi drove us from the airport to the hotel. It took roughly half an hour. It has a grand entrance and lobby. Plenty of staff everywhere. Very helpful and spoke good English. We arrived 11:30 am, but the room was available without any fuss. Lots of elevators that works with your room key for security reasons. The room is very bad with 2 double beds, plenty of storage, large bathroom,  spacious walk in shower, complimentary toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, soap bar, 2 tooth brush/paste,), tea/coffee facilities, iron, ironing board, 2 bath robes, mini bar (empty), 2 complimentary water bottles, few WiFi, Safe. Breakfast on 3rd floor",5,0.9414
Had a great stay at this property. Close to a lot of activities and staff were very friendly and accommodating.  Breakfast was also very good. I was there for three days I would stay at this hotel again.  If I am ever in Bangkok,5,0.8953
"Wonderful property, walking distance to the BTS, plenty of excellent dining options are just a short walk and just down the street from a fantastic mall. I will definitely return to this property in the future.",5,0.9287
Hyatt Place serves as the best place for the travel purpose. I have been World of Hyatt member for last 2-3 years and so far the benefits that I have received are the best in class and quality. The place is 100% worth of staying and economical for all people. The location is great as the BTS Skytrain is only few meters away form the hotel.,5,0.9536
"The nitty gritty:  The room, service, and location were all great.  Surrounding area had everything you need.  7-11, restaurants, and a mall not too far away.  The only small issue was the sink just would not drain quickly but that's just nitpicking.  AC was excellent and I'd definitely come back.",5,0.9032
"Very helpful staff and excellent location will keep us coming back :) Rooms and bathrooms are clean, no problem with airconditioning. Staff also very accomodating - from front desk to housekeeping to security.",5,0.8748
"Honestly a 4+ star property. Great location in Sukhumvit area. Overall, staff was very friendly, helpful, and polite. Great hotel value for the price. The room was clean and space-efficient. Would recommend this property to anyone looking for a clean, safe location at a reasonable price. ",4,0.9834
"This was a business trip (as usual). The new General Manager went out of his way to provide me with his business care and greeted me warmly at every encounter. I also bumped into the previous General Manager, who gave me some valuable tips on travel within the Hyatt ecosystem for the region. As always, the staff was caring and excellent. The breakfast was delicious as always, and I finally had the opportunity to have a meal upstairs in the lounge (Aire Bar). The views were spectacular, and the wonderful service made it a relaxing experience for a team discussion.",5,0.984

"My wife and I stayed at the Hyatt Place Sukhomvit during a five day visit to Bangkok.   We very much enjoyed our stay.   And the hotel was a superb value for what we paid.     Location is great, only about 400 yards from the Phrom Phong skytrain station.   Staff were super helpful and friendly our entire stay -- perhaps the friendliest staff I have ever encountered in a hotel!  It could be because the hotel GM was out and about talking to guests and checking on things, very impressive.     Our room, 811, was almost exactly as shown in the Tripadvisor photo.  The bathroom was great.   The TV, safe, and other items in the room worked fine.  Free internet was good.  The included breakfast (for World of Hyatt members) was extensive and tasty.   The restaurant was also open limited",5,0.9926
The room pics showed on booking.com were of higher end room..so don't get fooled by these fraud gimmicks.  The hotel was average in terms of amenities. Only location is good. Overall a sad experience..,1,-0.4245

"We have stayed at many awesome Hyatt hotels including Grand Hyatts, Park Hyatts, Hyatt Regencies, and Hyatt Places around the world but we enjoyed our stay at Hyatt Place Bangkok Sukhumvit the most as it was excellent in every aspect and it was a home away from home. We spent 8 wonderful days here.  First the service was first class and top notched.  A big shout out to the front desk staff, they were the very best we have ever encountered. Whether it was helping us with checking in/out, set up Grab accounts, translating Thai to English and vice versa, recommending places to visit and restaurants to dine (and they were spot on), making dinner reservations on our behalf, they do so with genuine friendliness, promptness, and professionalism, going above and beyond. They certainly",5,0.9905
It's our second time Bangkok and  we are very glad to have chosen Hyatt this time. Location is perfect.  Less than 5 minutes walk to the mall and BTS line. Hotel is absolutely clean and the staff are amazing.  All are helpful and very accommodating. They really make our experience great. Until next time Hyatt.,5,0.9669
* New property that is great value. 3 min walk to BTS sky train.   * Rooms have poor lighting at night. Would’ve given 5 stars if the rooms were better lit. Great ambiance for a romantic moment but not enough light to do work or with small children. The front desk moved me to a different room. If you need more light choose a room with the sofa sleeper where they have an extra room lamp.   * Very basic pool and gym.   * Amazing free breakfast for World of Hyatt members. Great spread for a free breakfast and one of the best I’ve seen at a Hyatt Place (live egg and noodle station).   * Would definitely stay again.,4,0.9903
"We usually stay in the Phrom Phong district for its convenience. This is a better option than the Doubletree nearby at similar price, but if Hilton has special promotion it may worth considering Hilton which is a stone throw away.   This Hyatt Place features large windows and rooms at higher floors enjoy panoramic view of the neighborhood and sunset. We stayed in the 27-sqm View King Room with sofabed. The TV is oddly positioned that you won't be able to face it directly from neither the  bed not sofabed. But we love the sofabed for resting. There is no bathtub but shower facility. The room is perfectly decent, comfortable and functional. Would be happy to stay here again.  位置很好，高層客房能俯瞰附近區域和看到日落。我們選擇了有梳化床的客房，非常舒適。浴室不設浴缸。以這價位來說算是很不錯的選擇，比鄰近的Doubletree為佳。",4,0.9866
"Very nice hotel in a quiet area, located a few mins away from the bts station, staff where very friendly especially the very tall security man , we where celebrating our anniversary and they complimentary upgraded us with 2 free drinks and an extremely early check in was available which was great after 24 hours travelling(we arrived at 10am) check in staff where very friendly along with the bar staff at the aire bar, pool was clean and very refreshing at this time of the year, we have no hotel booked for our return trip to Bangkok and will definitely stay again...

"A day before arriving, I made the booking as well as sent an email to arrange for a pick up from the airport. Nan from Reservations team responded within an hour to confirm the details. Such swift service and timely responses. There was three different pickup options and we booked the cheapest option since we were not fussy for a Toyota Camry costing 2200THB per way. We were 2 pax with 2 big luggages. Our driver was very welcoming and helpful. Arriving to Bangkok after many years, it was nice to feel welcomed by him. We wanted to smoke and he went out of his way to stop at a nearby roadside for us to have a quick smoke before continuing on the journey. Before leaving the airport, he informed us of how long it would take and When reaching the hotel, he let us know 5 mins before",4,0.9179
"Hidden gem. Staff are absolutely delightful, friendly and very helpful and patient.... Room was immaculate and bed was soooo comfortable. Breakfast was delicious, just enough variety to meet all tastebuds! Highly recommended.",5,0.964
"Good location, close to BST station.  Close to Em quartier. Good coffee shops, food court there. Rooms are nice and clean.  Breakfast is good. Coffee could have been better. Gym is a bit small but for a short stay, it's ok. A wall clock would be helpful in the gym. Front desk staff was patient in explaining the directions. ",4,0.9331
"To begin with, the hotel is located in the heart of Bangkok and is close to the BTS train station.  The room was well appointed with all required amenities and housekeeping was exceptional!  The breakfast buffet was ample with many continental and Asian options to choose from. We saw the General Manager serving guests and cleaning up after them which really warmed our hearts. A leader who leads by example.  But the highlights of our stay were the help and services extended by two people: Mr. Ball at the Concierge and Mr. Sarawut Thamjun with Security.  Ball went out of his way to grab us a taxi and made great conversation to keep us entertained while we were waiting. Sarawut was a delight. An absolute delight. Lovely conversation and extremely humble and helpful. He's an asset",5,0.9859
"Very attentive staff with more amenities than you can expect at a select service property. Room size more than adequate with bright bath. Both extremely clean with instant hot water and good pressure in shower. Breakfast buffet a definite winner. Good selection of western &amp; Asian options. Something for everyone. Location is good and close to everything, i.e malls, public transportation, restaurants etc. Very good value...would highly recommend.",5,0.9755
I have been staying here every other month when i travel to Bangkok . Sometimes just a few nights when i arrive from Washington and again before i fly back home. I am always upgraded to either a vista room or a suite. The hotel is maybe 3 years old but the GM makes sure the hotel continues to look like it just opened yesterday.  Super clean and all the staff are very friendly and helpful. The bed is super comfortable and i get a great rest especially after arriving from a long flight from Washington. The breakfast buffet on the 3rd floor Galley provides and fantastic buffet.  Two chefs cook your egg or asian breakfast requests. It is close the the bts skytrain and a major shopping complex at the end of the street. I highly recommend this Hyatt to anyone whether on business or,5,0.9946
HyattPlaceBankok hotel is close to the PhromPhong station(BTS). the room makes me feel calm. It's soooooo comfortable! This bed is great. The only problem is that The shower is weak. I want to have you improve that.,5,0.8221
"Value for money, good location, within walking distance to phrom phong BTS Station. Lots of good foods, massage parlour, shopping (not far from Emquarter), tailor and hair salons.  Soi 24 is within Japanese community, if walk further, there is a good Japanese cafe cum confectionery worth trying.   ",4,0.9001

"The hotel is too far away from the BTS,,nearly at the back of the alley street which is quite a distant.  Had high expectation of the room and not as what I thought but still clean and big.  There is no indication of where the lobby is until you go into the lift which wasn't helpful at all.",3,-0.2728
"The room was big enough, and the staff in reception were willing to help. Special compliment to concierge staff (male staff), he gave me many advice for sightseeing and help us to call taxi. Also the location was good and near to BTS station.",5,0.9201
"I get great value by booking direct and doing a little bit of extra homework and preserverance to get my Best Rate Guarantee honoured! I was also pleasantly surprised by the welcome email and promptly requested some items from Odds and Ends Menu as well as timely setup of sofa bed.However when I entered my room,none of these was setup so I informed the staff who assisted me to carry my luggage and he promptly informed the Housekeeping to do the necessary  Few more good points lots of TV channels including Korean channels(I suppose to cater to the Korean crowd), the Kenet MD amenities as well as the simple,tasty and filing breakfast complimentary for WoH member.Rather unfortunately the rotation item were vegetarian items mostly but I still enjoyed them!

"Clean room with great view.  A short walk (5min) to BTS.  There are message center nearby (LEK Message) and 7-11 is just opposite.   However during my way back to airport, we get the hotel to call a TAXI for us. They call a non meter taxi where we got charge by expensive fare, they should have called METERED Taxi.  ",4,0.7783
"I’m a returning guest to Hyatt Place for the third time. This property is always my top choice in BKK. Rooms are spacious, chic and modern. The bed and pillows are so comfortable. Staff are superb and very welcoming. Breakfast is always great and plentiful. Prime location on Sukhumvit Soi 24, mins away from BTS on foot. Highly recommend Hyatt Place, they will not let you down.

"A comfortable  hotel, comfortable  rooms, great service and staff very attentive and helpful, great location in downtown close to BTS station. A drink at the Aire Bar terrace before a dinner, with the amazing city-view initiated a great evening. there are simply no flaws! Absolutely recommendable.",5,0.9773
"Staying at a bed and breakfast would have been a much better option. Service is mediocre at best. Check in staff seem unhappy and the breakfast counter lady was more interested in her mobile phone than working. I stayed at an IBIS hotel previously at a cheaper price with much better service. Hyatt also recorded the wrong membership number, although I have included it during my room reservations. There are better options for the same price in Bangkok. ",2,0.8832
"Recently, I came back from the trip of Bangkok. I stayed in Hyatt place bangkok Sukhumvit for 4 days. Walking down the street about 5 minutes from Emporium, the hotel will be on your right. It's convenient for you to come out an exit near Starbucks on Ground floor of Emporium. Even though the hotel is inside of street, I wouldn't feel dangerous due to other major hotels nearby such as Hilton, Oakwood. Not only Emporium&amp;Emquartier but Seven convenient store is in front of hotel. The room condition was perfect. It was clean and the amenity was sufficient including shampoo, conditioner, body wash, body lotion. If you want to have something more, you may ask to reception desk which people are super helpful.

"I have stayed here like 10 times since it was opened a couple years ago and it kept going better until this stay. I found a lot of vegetarian dishes at breakfast which should be only occasional. But it turns to be regular. Well, not sure if the hotel wanted to save cost since Breakfast is always included for the Hyatt Place. I don’t like this idea and might stay somewhere else since there are enough choices for hotels in Bangkok. Please keep improving or you keep losing customers.",3,0.9142
"Only stayed for a night ~5 mins walk from BTS station convenience store nearby free breakfast for hyatt member  Staff are nice and helpful  The only let-off is the restaurant, too small and crowded, and there are not many food you can choose",4,0.836
"A bit difficult to review since I was only here for less than 8 hours, but enjoyed that time spent here. Room was small, but extremely nice. Hotel seems very new, and a real bargain for the cost. Did notice a lack of TV channels in English, but that is a minor issue. Did not even sleep due to leaving at 11:30pm for my flight, but the bed seemed fine when sitting on it (I should have paid better attention). Staff were great, as always in Bangkok. Internet worked well the short time I used it. Normally my reviews are very comprehensive, but I just did not experience enough this time to be more thorough. I can say that I would definitely return here, as it is an excellent value!",5,0.9894
"We stayed Aug 21-24 and for the three days there,  the breakfast experience leaves much to be desired .   1) Coffee :The 2 coffee machines were malfunctioning with tape masking over some choices such as latte, cappuccino etc.  The first day we went down for breakfast at 0920 and coffee machine was already run out except hot milk ( warm only).  The guy after me had steam only, ie, milk also ran out . And the hot water tap ran out too, no hot water for tea !    The 2nd day, we went down at 0820 hoping to beat the crowds and guess what, both coffee machines were again out of order.  A guy subsequently  came in to fix them and things should be better the next day  .  On the third day, we went down at 0750 and hey ,great, the coffee machine finally had coffee in them and we each had",3,0.7777

Staff are all super friendly and helpful.  They are all very observant and all in action ready to help.  And they all wear the brightest smiles on their faces.

"The hotel is well situated near the BTS station and around it there are many good places to eat and to go shopping! the staff is super friendly and very helpful! I stayed here twice for a few nights during a period of 3 weeks and both times my room was excellent, I was with my 20 month old daughter for which they had placed a baby bed in the room. it was big, clean, great amenities, good wifi, well insulated so the rooms are quiet &amp; an awesome breakfast to start the day well! The pool on the 8th floor is not very big but perfect for a little swim to cool down after a busy day running around Bangkok! there were business people, couples, families with children and solo travellers and everyone seemed very relaxed. I will definitely stay here again when going back to Bangkok!",5,0.9893

"Have really high expectations for this Hyatt Place property before my stay as i was contemplating between this and Doubletree Hilton.   Room issued was a corner room as i booked a standard room without the sofa bed. The room design was bad. The main door open directly to the bed head. Lack privacy. TV stand in the middle of the room was badly integrated with the entire space. The table at the door of the bathroom is in the way. Room was too dim even when all lights are switched on. Super small gym and pool. Tissue napkins were not replenished to full in bathroom, run out after a few pulls. Bathroom does not come with bath tub. Mini bar in room is almost literally empty.   Called front desk and requested for late check out to 1pm, was granted but the tone of the staff wasnt as",3,-0.3096

Near sky train and also near excellent shopping.  Staff were always very helpful... both in lobby and at front door.  The slight ""issues"" resulting in 4 rather than 5 stars.....  1.  Breakfast:   Was always crowded.  Sometimes had to wait for a table, but always had to wait on a line for eggs (made to order), etc.   Also - always a line at the coffee machine - which made very good coffee.  2.  Swimming Pool:   Small - but that is ok.  The problem is there are only 6 lounge chairs and almost always taken.",4,0.9488
"I stayed in the corner room. Wide windows enabled me to get wonderful view and lots of sunshine made me relax. But because my room was located next to the lift machine room, noises from motors sometimes irritated me especially at night time. I felt planning and construction quality was generally poor. Rooftop bar was very good atmosphere unlike some other rooftops with noisy music. One thing I complain is that lots of mosquitoes made me uncomfortable. Hotel should prepare repellent for each table. This is nice hotel but you can't expect too much because of its reasonable price in spite of Hyatt brand.",4,-0.486

This was the best hotel ever. They even checked us in super early which was awesome. The lobby elevator situation is annoying but otherwise it was very fancy and had a great pool and stuff. Felt like Allstars and choose to the transit,5,0.9403
We recently stayed in a corner room at this hotel.  The room was nice and big with a very comfortable King Bed.  We had a great view from the 12th floor.  We are a family of 4 and the pull out sofa worked out very well and was large enough for our two 10 and 11 year old daughters.  The rooftop bar is worth the stay itself.  Really beautiful view and great happy hour.  The girls also loved the rooftop pool!  Excellent buffet breakfast and very reasonably priced.  Perfect for getting your day started in Bangkok!

I support going green but it's very inconvenient to get even the basic hotel amenities like slippers, shower caps, razors, vanity kit from the front desk.   Room amenities were not replaced after cleaning. I called the front desk three times at night to ask for a bath towel and 2 tea bags and they didn't come until the next day.
