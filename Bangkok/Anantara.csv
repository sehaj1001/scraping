I love staying here. Great rooms. Great restaurants &amp; bars. Very attentive &amp; friendly staff. The staff remember you if you have stayed here before and after a day all the staff know you. Super attentive to ensure you have a great stay.,5,0.9808
"I was fortunate to stay at this hotel(my first time) and it left a great impression on me. It's a 5 star rated hotel for which each of those stars are well deserved.  The hotel is centrally located within walking distance to some of the big malls as well as the sky train system (a must use when in Bangkok). It has a beautiful reception area with the most helpful and friendliest staff that just highlights the great hospitable culture I have come to appreciate of Thai people. The rooms are spacious, clean and includes a fully stocked minibar (pricy as one would expect from any hotel minibar) coffee making facilities, a safe and iron/ironing board. It also includes a handy phone which you can take with you during exploring or just wherever you go. It's great for creating a wifi hot",5,0.991
"We stayed here for 5 nights, it a lovely Hotel, the location is great a few minutes walk to the train and Central World a huge shopping Mall. The rooms are lovely and spacious and beautifully decorated.  The choice at breakfast was amazing.  The pool was not a great outlook was still lovely.  The pool staff would move your umbrellas and give cold water and a lemon drink.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and we will be back in the near future once this crazy COVID 19 has disappeared.",5,0.9839
"Still outstanding. The staff seemed even more attentive than 3 years ago, the service was second to none. Breakfast had moved venues and seemed to have improved as well, if that was at all possible. The highest possible standards appear to have been improved upon since 2017.",5,0.9062
"We stayed 2 nights , the hotel located in the city centre where you are easily going to shopping places or tourist places . BTS station is only 2-3 minutes away. Room was so good, comfortable and clean. Breakfast also great.",5,0.9479
"Nice property no doubt, a very welcoming lobby. Can never forget the receptionist (Garfield, yup her name is Garfield) who was very helpful despite us checking in at 0300hrs. the room was massive and the pool was nice too. over all was great lovely decor at the lobby. The prices for drinks at the bar seemed a lil on the higher side, but then again it is a 5 * property. over all, yes i would stay there again.",4,0.9154
"Had a very comfortable 4D3N stay at this hotel. Staff hospitality and service was excellent from beginning till the end. Room was very comfortable and is good value for price paid. Complimentary breakfast was of a decent range with a good quality items served. In my opinion, the best  thing about this hotel is the location in the middle of the city. BTS station is just outside and many malls, attractions and restaurants are just a 5min walk from hotel.",5,0.9817
"Not to be confused with Anantara Riverside resort which is also a great hotel. The room and poor were nice, the restaurant was good too, they also had good atmosphere which made my entire stay pleasant. Definitely a family friendly hotel. I would love to visit there again anytime soon.",4,0.9749
"The room is super nice and the decoration is superb as you can see from the images.    My brother stayed there 1 night while I’m staying in another hotel nearby.  However in the late night, I got a call from his gf informed me that my brother got seizure. Thus, I rushed out and asked hotel staff to call ambulance.  The hotel staff team came up and helped to contact ambulance and facilitate us for the process. They automatically inform me that do not worry about the room and can comeback anytime after update my brother situation.   At the end, my brother had to admit in the hospital nearby and got released on the next day. During departure, duty manager whom help us since tht night,Tanya, came up with a basket of beautiful flower and wishing my brother for good health.   Once",5,0.9761
"Exceptional hotel with the comfort of the guests at it's heart.  Lovely staff, great location.  BTS sky train station just a few steps away with Central World, Siam Discovery and Siam Centre at the top of the road in the opposite direction.  Couldn't fault it, thoroughly a 5 star hotel (with 5 star prices too!)",5,0.9294
We had a wonderful stay in this hotel where nothing seemed to be a problem for the staff. They made special meals for us as vegetarians. The concierge arranged excursions at a very good rate and also helped to arrange outdoor activities in Chiang Mai. The ambience near the restaurant was very relaxing and peaceful.,5,0.9306
"We stayed at this wonderful hotel for 6 nights, from the great welcome from Sandy checking us in our experience was 100% fabulous. We stayed in a club room and the club team looked after us so well, the chefs were also very good. The pool team were friendly and even though there was maintenance work being carried out, it didn’t spoil our time there. We have been staying in Bangkok for over 40 years in various 5 star hotels,  Anantara has so far been our favourite, see you next year!",5,0.9758
"good service and nice facility. Very convenient to park, check in and check out. Very helpful and polite staff. I will certainly be back to the hotel.  My experience is upto one of the best standard in hotel.",5,0.9371
"We stayed for 3 nights before travelling back to London.  We’ve stayed in many city hotels but this was such a memorable hotel because of the outstanding service from the staff. We chose the Anantara because of the location and facilities and it is as described by other reviews and does not disappoint. However, from the moment we arrived at check in, the professional, friendly and informative service from Tanya was such a welcome change.  This standard of service continued throughout our stay in the bars, restaurants and breakfast.  We were particularly impressed with the Aqua bar and Spice Market and found the prices very reasonable considering it is a 5 star hotel. Check out was equally pleasurable by Sandy and transport arranged to the airport. We will definitely be returning",5,0.9854
Would highly recommend staying at this beautiful welcoming hotel.  We were treated like royalty.  Our day started with a breakfast like none other - buffet style with everything you could hope for - and the coffee was fantastic.  Then after speaking with the friendly accommodating concierge service (especially Mee - she was fantastic) we had our day arranged and headed out into Bangkok.  Upon return we cooled down beside a very large pool with outstanding service poolside.  Our large beautiful room was clean and had all the  modern convinces we needed.  Can't wait to return!,5,0.9894
"Thumb up for Sunday Brunch here as it is very good in quality of foods, variety of choice, worth the money. Staffs also helpful and Thai hospitality smiles. Grand staircases is very gorgeous,  beautiful.  Certainly to come back here again.",5,0.9754
I have stayed here a number of times and more often than not the service and reception does not disappoint. F&amp;B always good and a good choice of cuisines. Location is convenient and so easy to get around. BTS is just metres away. ,5,0.9022
"We stayed for 3 nights at end February, in a suite that gave us club lounge access. We had a lovely view over the golf club so it felt like we were not in the middle of the city. The room was one of the largest suites we have stayed in with a large bathroom, bedroom, lounge.  The room was very quiet &amp; dark at night so we had a great night's sleep. The club lounge had a good selection of food &amp; drink. Great for a pre-dinner drink &amp; appetizer. The breakfast was served in either an air con area or an outdoor courtyard. The outdoor pool was secluded &amp; quiet. The steam room &amp; onsen were separate for men &amp; women and were of excellent quality. We ate at the hotel's Japanese restaurant, where the food was of exceptional quality. The service was amazing throughout the hotel. Starting",5,0.9786
Excellent experience. Great location. Nice hotel. Amazing service. Prompt and pleasant. Spice market was an excellent experience. Would recommend anytime. Staff are great. Helpful and efficient. Keep it up. ,5,0.9868
"We arrived early for the Sunday brunch, because we had the old timetable that it starts at 11.30 am. Now it begins at 12.00 pm. But Khun Nuk took care of us. She found us a table for two in the lobby and we got soft drinks and a snack. Shortly before the opening of the brunch we got our table in the Madison. The brunch is served partly in the Madison and partly outside in a nice surrounding.  During brunch Khun Ma-Meaw and her colleague Jae cared for us. They were fast in taking away the empty dishes, asking several times if we need something else. When we ordered some food or drink our wishes were fulfilled fast. They were the whole time friendly and smiling. Their supervisor Janni kept in the background but we got the feeling he knew all was fine. We had several salads, cold",5,0.8926
"The hotel has a unique historic atmosphere, yet its rooms and facilities have everything you'd expect in a modern 5* hotel. I particularly love the amazing breakfast buffet and the modern well equipped gym.",5,0.8923
"First visit to this brand. Impressed with the warm hospitality provided especially by some staff. SANDY from the front desk was quick to respond to my request to change to a quieter room. She offered further assistance even knowing the next two days are her off days.  Madison team is the best. Their warmth and genuine care deserves to be recognised especially TRIO, BEW and ROSE. Truly impressed with their genuine hospitality.  Will definitely return to this hotel.",5,0.9723
"Amazing hotel with wonderful staff and services! We arrived by Grab from another location. When we were at the check-in counter, my girlfriend realized that she left her phone in the Grabcar. Luckily the staff, namely Miss Tanya was super proactive, to investigate the type of car with the company, and with a few phone calls, she managed to get back the driver to the hotel, and the phone was found! Thank you, Miss Tanya! After check-in we arrived at the room, a wonderful preparation was waiting for us. Photos attached. This hotel was amazing, we could feel that. The pool is also super nice, where you can relax and order some fresh coconut for refreshment. The breakfast is very delicious, have a large variety to choose from, with a view to a fish pond! The location is very close",5,0.992
"Here is everything beyond perfection. One of nya bosomy year best experience ever, the staff from all departments is doing everything for the guest. Always with a warm smile and “no problem attitude”.  Surely will be back ! New favorite hotel in 2020!",5,0.944
"We only stayed for 1 night in February just before our flight home to London the next day but we both wished we could have stayed for more than 1 night.   The staff from entering the hotel to when we left were helpful, charming, knowledgeable and very polite. We booked a Kasara Club Room with lounge access.  On arrival at reception we were taken to the 7th floor to check in.  We were offered drinks (hotel or cold).  We were explained the hotel facilities and the extra's that came with the room we booked.  We were then shown to our room which was lovely.  The bathroom was very spacious and the bedroom area which contained 2 armchairs and a desk was also spacious.  The bed was very comfortable and the room immaculately clean.  We did use the lounge where there was a good selection",5,0.9824
"Like the room decoration feel very cozy and it comes with good taste. also the hotel lobby is ver impressive with the sense of seasonal theme,fresh flowers are everywhere for the feast of the eyes. Staffs are courtious and friendly. All in all, i feel very comfortable here and will highly recommend it to all the people that i know.",5,0.9544
"We have been at the Anantara Siam hotel since Sunday and I have to say it is the loveliest place we have stayed (and we are lucky enough to have visited lots of great places!). The staff are fantastic, nothing is too much trouble.  Our room is big with a very comfortable bed, large bathroom with bath and huge shower and great air-con. The cleaning staff do an amazing job-last night when we got in we found fresh flowers on our bed!   Breakfast here is an experience! Lots of gorgeous fresh food, fruit, curries, American and English breakfast food, Japanese cuisine and even a gluten free section with muffins and fresh breads and cereals.  Ma-Meaw and Fata have greeted us every morning with big smiles and offers of freshly brewed drinks, the restaurant runs smoothly with Jammi",5,0.9911
"We enjoyed a booking with Kasara Executive Lounge benefits - a lovely space with excellent treats and service. Everything about the experience was impecible - including the gym, jacuzzi and sauna and Maddison Cafe breakfast, which are available for all guests (noy just to Kasara guests). The location is very convenient with easy access to Bangkok's main attarctions. As with most things, the people - the staff - who made our time at Anantara extra special. Thank you, one and all.",5,0.9673
"Excellent service! Every staffs has a smile on their face. Clean room. Location is good. Efficient check in and out.  5-10 mins walk to the mall area. Breakfast is very nice. Even prepared roses on Vday! Just only one cons, the water drainage in the tub and sink is a bit slow in the room. However, the hotel makes my vacation! Thank you! ",5,0.9703
"We had a good time here at Anantara Siam with our family. Staffs are well trained. Breakfast was perfect. I would like to take the chance to thank chefs and all staffs. Especially, Am, Ploy and Praew have given us a good impression to stay at Anantara Siam. My room was well set up for my little girl before arrival. Well done. Will come back.",5,0.967

"Been here for lunch at Thai restaurant “Spice Market”     The taste of foods were great and the service from staff were good as well. The most highlighted one is the painting mural on the wall and ceiling, it is very beautiful and quite unique.",5,0.923
"The Anantara Siam continues to please. Great hospitality and location. Above all, love the charm of this not being a typical high rise modern hotel. Consistently good. Definitely my go to hotel when visiting Bangkok.",4,0.9578
"I don’t often find myself writing reviews when the experience has been positive (such is the bias of the review system), however I couldn’t not write something for this hotel. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi that brought us to its doorstep, to the moment we got back into a taxi 2 days later to leave for the airport, we were treated like royalty. Everyone, from the cleaning staff to the reception staff, greeted and smiled at us like we were their dear friends. Service was completely flawless - any requests were immediately responded to, I literally couldn’t find a single fault in our stay. Breakfast was the most incredible array of foods I’ve ever seen. We wished we’d been able to stay longer, if only to take full advantage of the multiple facilities and luxury on",5,0.9647
"The hotel provides very good service. Also the hotel itself was very nice and beautiful. So relaxed, staying there. This made my business trip like my leisure. The breakfast had various kinds of foods from around the world. I would recommend this hotel to everyone.",5,0.958
"Well, while I cannot bestow that distinction for certain, the staff at the Anantara Siam Hotel would certainly be in the discussion. My gosh. Everyone, from the checkin clerk to the bell hop to the ladies manning the 7th floor lounge to the waiter at the Italian restaurant to the folks at the lobby bar, we were treated like Kings. Even the elevators complied. We typically waited about five seconds, or less.  We loved the hotel. It has “areas” that are visually beautiful, including the lobby and the Parichart Court. Talk about peaceful, in the middle of a chaotic city, that “atrium” is pretty nice, with a beautiful and fully stocked fish pond and bridge.  The location of the hotel is ideal, an 8 minute walk to the Central Market Mall (very nice mall). Another 5 minutes gets you",5,0.9847
"We went to this hotel for our 30th Wedding Anniversary.  It was a great choice.  The staff especially Am, Kak and Ying were superb.  The room was large with a comfortable bed and a bathroom with a separate deep bath and a walk in shower.  The room was on the 4th floor and very quiet.  The pool was big with lots of shade.  In the evening we ate at The Spice Market restaurant on the Ground Floor.  I had the Parichart Set menu and my wife had the other set menu.  The Thai food was fantastic and so was the service.  In the morning there was an excellent buffet breakfast.  The only criticism I have of the hotel is the carpets.  The wood and tile flooring were sparkling clean, but the carpets were worn and stained in places.  I would suggest that these be replaced with wood or tile",5,0.8225
"I love this hotel so much.  The atmosphere is inviting and luxurious.  The food and restaurants are amazing.  The staff members are some of the most amazing people I've encountered in my travels.  Thanya, Pomme, Ploy, Tawee &amp; Nantapon at front desk are some of the kindest people I have ever met, and are super helpful!  The Madison restaurant has some amazing people as well.  Deaw, Trio, Golf, Farah, Au &amp; Mameaw were so kind to me every day at breakfast.  I will be coming back to Anantara Siam because I love this place, and would stay here for any other hotel.",5,0.9887
"We stayed at the hotel for 2 days. Everything was perfect , room very clean and the atmosphere was very comfortable like  our home. The located also perfect with surrounded by BTS and shopping center. Breakfast was extremely hight service staff and hospitalities and special thanks to Khun Chompoo.  There are many selection of food, especially vegetarian corner and noodle was very tasty.  We ‘ll be back again next time.  ",5,0.9697
Nice and relaxing stay for five days. The thai styled decoration gives the local flavour.,5,0.7184
"Not sure how this hotel got to be so highly rated, but for the money I would have rather paid a tiny bit more to stay next door at the Waldorf Astoria! The lobby 'bar' doesn't actually have a bar to sit at &amp; you're forced to listen to depressing piano music day &amp; night. The 'nighttime bar' is really a removable pop up 'bar' in the outdoor courtyard (not air-conditioned) with a DJ &amp; a scattering of a few people, hardly what I'd qualify as a bar &amp; again seriously lacking any type of atmosphere. I can also say the same for the 'World Famous' Sunday Brunch which we ended up cancelling (thank goodness!) since it too was set up in the non air-conditioned courtyard with zero ambiance, and definitely would not have been worth $130 USD per person, even with the booze! For the rooms, we",1,-0.8835
"It's a very decent hotel, beautiful decoration with Thai traditional style. Perfect location, just close to BTS station. Every staff is very nice, and would like to  give you help when you in need. I like the decoration and breakfast, we enjoyed a good stay in Thailand. It's definitely a good choice when you travel in Bangkok.   By the way, next door is St. Regis hotel, you can enjoy all the facilities of both hotel, and have quit a lot choice of restaurants, we really enjoyed a nice Japanese meal there.  Walk to the shopping center isn't too far, it will take about 15 mins to Central World, very popular shopping mall, it's  really a good place to enjoy shopping and relaxing time.   VERY close to All sides Buddha! You will see the special ceremony there in some special days,",5,0.9951
"One of the best just keeps getting better!  Anantara Siam Bangkok since taking over the property from The Four Seasons has continuously upped their game. In a neighbourhood that boasts hotels like the St. Regis, Grand Hyatt, Intercontinental and the Waldorf Astoria etc.. it still stands out as the gem in pure old school charm and sheer hospitality in every respect",5,0.9565
Very comfortable stay and very professional service.  Very large choice of breakfast so everyone can find something suitable to his taste. However I find the taste to be very average. We had a promotion price so it's fine but at full price I'm not sure I'll choose this one. But very good option for business trip. ,4,0.689

"This hotel was perfect! The deluxe twin room was spacious, elegant and very comfortable.  The staff have been absolutely wonderful, extremely polite , attentive, smiley and nothing was too much trouble.  They have looked after us incredibly well, really spoiling us for my mother birthday.  She was sang to and given cake at breakfast, and always a lovely table and asked if everything was ok.

"Great location, close to lots of malls and restaurants. Beautiful property but needs a face lift. Booked airport transportation with hotel, which worked very well. Check in person was waiting for me at curbside as the car pulled over. Great staff and attentive service. She offered me a breakfast box for my return to the airport as I was departing really early a few days later. Room was spacious, great bed and pillows, big bathroom with good quality toiletries, separate bath tub from shower. Shower had little pressure but they changed the head promptly, which solved the problem. Despite being comfortable, room felt outdated (the decor) and lacked natural light.

"This is the best experience we have ever had in a hotel, anywhere in the world. The service is above and beyond anything we have ever experienced before.

Thank you very, very much!  We had a cabana room next to the swimming pool, with Kasara lounge access, both HIGHLY recommended for a romatic break in this buzzling city.

We were impressed by the overall empathy and helpfulness of the staff at all levels. The variety of clothes the different staff wears makes the experience even better with great colours. What impressed most were- The resourcefullness of the reception staff in finding a solution that compensated for the closure of the swimming pool the day we arrived because of a party. We specially reserved a hotel with pool for our last days in Thailand and that was a dissappointment but the way it was handled was exemplary The pool staff we experienced the necnxt day is so friendly and helpful and added extra flavour to our wonderful stay The breakfast experience is very rich and it was difficult to chose from the enormous variety.

Stayed post Christmas after having an excellent stay at Anantara Lawana resort. Unfortunately the check in was very slow and we were not provided a room until 3 pm which is their regular check in time. Our request for a early check in by 1 hour was also not honoured for which we felt disappointed as my daughter was really tired. Would recommend if they can accept families request for early check in specifically because they did not allow our request for late checkout by 1 hour also. The lay over between checking and checkout of 3 hours looks to extended. Other issue was very limited vegetarian options at breakfast. Also the bakery section was very limited and was not fresh. Staff were very courteous including the check in staff. Otherwise the rooms and our stay was good.,4,-0.197

If you like to have some bread, the bakery shop is also a venue for you to having a meal. Overall experience is excellent.",5,0.9716

"Hotel is ideally located near the sky train.  Our room was large, comfortable and a good size, with easy chairs and a desk area. Breakfast was busy and the selection of food extensive.  The cocktails from Aqua bar, in the evening, were lovely.  The staff kept our room clean and well stocked, and the reception staff were friendly and helpful.  Definitely recommend ",4,0.9829
"We were extremely impressed from the moment the reservation is done. From pre-stay email to warm welcome at the hotel to the departure, I really cannot find any fault. Many thanks to Anantara team for making this trip so memorable.",5,0.9091
"It is a very nice place to visit. The hotel is very beautiful and the staff is very friendly. The hotel located near BTS Station took me only 5-10 minutes to walk and is located near the shopping center, too.",5,0.8952
"Stayed for two nights. Good location in Bangkok, close to the train station. Bed was comfortable and the breakfast and afternoon tea was lovely. Only minor issue was that I was unable to make payment for the booking directly on the Anantara website (from South Africa) - so had to do a direct swift transfer. Would stay again. ",5,0.8957
"We liked the location of the hotel as it is next to the metro/tube. Very easy to go around with this transport.  Rooms are old but clean.  Breakfast is not the best, overcrowded and not good quality of food. You have to wait a lot to be seated, if you arrive at 8 or 9 AM, it is the same story.  But personnel very nice and smiling. The level of service in excellente .  My rate is taking into account the service and location.",4,0.8137
"Booked this place as last minute. Walked in and received a warm assistance and welcome from Jamal at the reception. Price was reasonable around 200 USD. Great value. Hotel facilities are perfect. Breakfast is amazing. The lady who make a turn down for us was super lovely. We had dinner at bicotti was really nice, nice set of cheese platter. Beer was pricey. The barber was really good Highly recommend this place.   Will",5,0.9899
Dishonest with upgrade. Staff claimed to have upgraded me but in fact it was not. My Discovery platinum status (and will reach Black after this horrible stay) is worthless at this hotel. My request for a call back during my stay was not taken care of.  The only good thing about this stay is the spa which was so good that I bought their product to take back home.,1,-0.8166
"Very comfortable room and bed, luxury hotel with great service. Hight quality of service mind, warm welcome feeling like home, staff always smile. Moreover, Italian restaurant - Biscotti, was very outstanding.",5,0.9697
"Nice old but classic building. The hotel used to be Four Seasons and Peninsula (I think). Good location can walk from the hotel to Siam Paragon. Polite and nice staffs. Good elevator, fast, even they look old. The basic room we stayed was huge nice decorated, giantic bathroom the only down side about the bathroom was water pressure. Ah yes there was a little problem with one bulb in the little closet that always blinking in 539. I had a room service(lots of options from the menu), it was very good. Breakfast was a little disappointed, yes there was a great selection for you to choose but in term of taste, not so good. However there were some joyful moments with desserts. ",4,0.9906
A very good hotel in the middle of the city of angel. Less than one minute walk to the public train. 5 minutes walk to the famous four faces Buddha and the area for shopping. Very nice foods nearby.

"The hotel itself is located in the heart of the Bangkok city. If you want to find places to go in Bangkok, you just walk 1 minuet to the Bangkok Sky Train. So easy to go everywhere. Swimming pool itself is very nice. I would recommend this place a lot to those who are finding a leisure stay in Bangkok. Thank you all staffs. You are wonderful. Brilliant 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻",5,0.9604
"Old school hospitality yet deluxed hotel. I stay in executive suit with business lounge accessibility. All stuff is excellent and quite an experience. Highly recommend this hotel if you enjoy great service, good facility, and excellent location.",5,0.9657
"The atmosphere and service at this Anantara cannot be faulted.  However, for a hotel of this stature, the devil is in the details.  For example, the last two times I've gone there, I had to ask for a room change because of stains all over the carpet.  After being moved to two other rooms at my last stay because of the same issue, we were moved to a larger suite, which was overall quite lovely.  But, the silk curtains had oily stains on them and the divan was equally stained.  Whoever is running this hotel needs to do a deep clean and carpets, especially, need to be replaced.  I won't go back again.",2,0.5313
"The room is very nice and clean. Hotel is  decorated in Thai style which looks a bit old but still under a good maintenance. The outdoor pool is beautiful but the water temperature cannot be adjusted ,so the it is quite cold sometimes if the weather is cool. Staffs are great as attempt to serve with a smile and helpfulness. Me and my family will return to this hotel again on the next chance for sure.",5,0.9876
"Had a chance to dine at Biscotti , I could say this is one of the best Italian restaurant in town! Staffs are all courteous and very warm welcome. Another great thing is the location , good as it is very convenient, nearby BTS.All is perfect!!",5,0.9789
"This is the best hotel in bangkok, I’ve meeting with friends and we choose this hotel as the hotel staff is very good service and food is delicious with traditional thai style. I’ve to say that this is great and I’ll come bace soon.",5,0.9601
"Nice business hotel in a very central location. Great design and a lot of interesting decorations which makes it interesting to wander around exploring the hotel. Great restaurants (but be careful, almost all of them are closed between 14:30 and 18:00). Some of the staff members are way too relaxed, we never heard so many “sorry, I forgot” in a 5* hotel. Kid’s club is a joke, the staff plays with their mobiles and asks guests to “put toys to their places when kids leave”.",4,0.9748
"excellent location to hang around the city, facilities well maintained, first class staff services, recommend Kasara club room with lounge access, good choices of food for breakfast; ideal hotel for vacation.",5,0.9274

Many amazing restaurants within easy walking distance.  The room is large, with great view of the golf course. Loccitane toiletries provided as well as must haves such as toothbrush and toothpaste. The decor is old school but the maintenance is top notch and cleanliness is first class. The bathroom is large and water pressure is very good. Most importantly, the staff are super friendly and helpful. ",5,0.9824

"Nature &amp; Comfortability can be found here. Excellent hospitality, good surrounding. Siam Suite really huge &amp; comfort. Breakfast really good especially a variety of menu served at egg station &amp; congee. Fresh fruit juice also good. ",5,0.9587
They tried to force me into a crap room calling it an upgrade! The room looked like it hadnt been renovated since the 80s. Had to fight with them t4pmo get the room category i had booked. Despite a check in they were completely disorganised. It's clear why anantara is a tiny hotel chain and not the standard u expect from a Starwood or marriott property. First pic is what I booked on booking.com and second one is what they gave me. ,1,0.1169
"100% recommendation.  Everyone will 'bend over backwards' to help and you in every possible way. Amazing rooms, facilities, location, and the staff could not be nicer or kinder. Huge options for eating..all of which were seriously good. I would not stay anywhere else in future. Anantara Siam is a treat i look forward to ALL year. ",5,0.9259
