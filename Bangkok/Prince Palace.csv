"Deceptively large hotel with a few different buildings.  Was upgraded to a suite when we arrived which was nice.  Rooms very dated, but lots of space and we even had a small kitchenette.  There is a restaurant on-site which we tried for dinner which was nice.  Breakfast was really nice, but pricey if not already included in the room price.  Didn't try the pool but was small for the size of the hotel, but never looked busy.  Great location.  Only negative was trying to get directions or a taxi somewhere.  Bellboy staff very unhelpful and reluctant to give us a map of the local area.  Hard to get reception staff to explain what is close etc. but that was a language barrier thing and not because they were unwilling to help.  All in all, a very good stay.",4,0.3406
Fantastic view from restaurant.. nice food and good service. Clean room and daily cleaner. Swimming pool with bar. Seven eleven shop near the hotel. ATM machine and taxis near the entrance. Highly recommended hotel! :) ,5,0.9542
The entrance really amaze me with the gold and luxury look. The staffs very friendly and the service tip top. We enjoyed our three days there. The food also great. Amazing hotel to stay with your loved ones.,5,0.9755
"We didnt like it at all. Its like to visit grangrandmother's room who keeps everything since 1960. Shower was for very small people, windows cleaned few years ago.. Wont come back for sure and recommend to choose other hotels.",1,0.1481
"We were 2 couples, who stayed twice, a week apart, in the hotel (going and returning from another country). Both times we found the rooms clean and spacious; the staff friendly and helpful; the breakfast had a large selection to choose from; the restaurants had a good choice of food; and the pool and pool bar area inviting (although windy at times as it was on the 10th floor). The hotel is spread over 4 towers, so that, depending on which tower your room is in, there can be a bit of a walk and ride in lifts (each tower has its own) to the lobby and restaurants. This didn't bother us. Because of last minute rescheduling of our flights due to a leg of our journey being cancelled, on our return journey we had to arrive 2 days earlier than we had originally booked, and stay 3 nights",4,0.9191
"Right in the heart of Bangkok. Amazing for amenities and tourism. Staff friendly, room very clean and maid was very polite. Pool area is just stunning and overlooks the skyline. Poolbar cocktails very nice around 300-450 baht per cocktail £8-£11. A great selections of restaraunts on site (I think around 8-9). The hotel is huge! There are 2 hotel towers at least 30 floors on each tower and the staff must work very hard to keep operations running smoothly.",5,0.9669
"We was in alot of accomodation in Thailand but this one need to be shut down and we never experience something like this. When we checked-in everything was ok, nice lobby and nice staff but things change when you stay a bit in your room. Everything is outdated, smelly room, dirty bathroom, windows but things are even worse when u find pubic hair in bathroom, around windows and bed where you need to sleep. We immediately call for manager to show him the room and he said he will give us another room. We went to check other room and sadly the things was same. We decided to leave hotel 1 hour after check-in and to be honest my dog have 10 times cleaner room and cleaner bed and I wouldn't let him to sleep there😷🤮",1,0.4998
"The entire team at Prince Palast was fantastic,very helpful,joyfull,the spirit that every hotel should have. greatly appreciated how kind everyone was to me especially thanks to Ms.Supaluk Noinar Iangaree (Front Clerk,Front Oficce)who helped me the most. Location perfect.Really nice View.Food very delicious,everyone should give it a try.clean rooms.I trully enjoyed my stay.Felt super confortabel and very welcomed there.for sure il come back when visit bangkok again.Great job guys.",5,0.9792
"I absolutely like this place! It's really fresh and nice view. It was absolute best massage I've ever had. Thank you Ms.Mod spa and everyone there is so pleasant, very welcoming. I'll visit there soon.",5,0.9724
"Beautiful environment, good location, convenient transportation, comfortable and hygienic rooms, friendly staff, willing to provide all kinds of help, rich breakfast.  The facilities are very user-friendly, the network high-speed signal is good, and the scenery outside the window is good.  There is a special bed-turning service, and the design of the small decoration in the room is also very distinctive.  Good value, staying next time",5,0.986
"We just check in to the hotel like 1hour before. The check in process was quite quick, but we have been asked to do a deposit which was not mentioned at the time of booking. Upon arrival to the room we noticed that we got a room with 2 single bed when we asked the receptionist she mentioned that we need to pay additional 1500bht/night to have a room with 1 double bed. The room has not been cleaned properly, still have hair on the floor, shower very old, mirror is dirty and the carpet smells of moisture and dampness -see photos.  The photos on website are very  misleading.The staff at the reception desk are not helpful at all and are rude. Don't plan holidays in couple here as you will be greatly disappointed just as we are at the moment and our holidays have been spoilt just as",1,-0.9676
"Firstly, we are late to write the review, nevertheless better late than Never :) The location is apt, close proximity to all places where you want to go &amp; at the same time quiet when you are inside. The palace is Great gives you a Royal feel, the buffet spread was very good covering all varieties. The hotel staff are friendly, they upgraded my stay too. There is a water stream which runs behind the hotel, it has water boat using which you can travel at a very cheap price &amp; avoid traffic too  Above all, the best part which made our stay memorable was 'The Great Customer Service' by Spa Manager 'MOD' - she is just amazing!! I planned to surprise my Wife on her B'day &amp; it was very well executed by MOD, from Spa to decorating Jacuzzi &amp; helping by personally assisting to get her",4,0.9824
"Superb service!!! Thank you  for Mod spa Manager and team, This is very skilled as professional service, It was so relaxing and cleanliness.I always feel great afterward.Highly recommemded",5,0.7163
"We booked a 3 night stay at this hotel jointly with our friends who had a 2 bedroom suite. We checked out after 1 night and both forego 2 nights paid accommodation. Hotel is so dated, old and smelly and in a horrible and dirty part of town. The rooms have smelly carpet, torn lounges, torn bed bases, light switches &amp; power points that don't work, filthy windows &amp; coverings, old &amp; peeling wallpaper, the list goes on. To make matters worse, the drinks throughout the hotel are so overpriced. If you can only afford a 2 star budget hotel in poor condition, then this place is for you. Honestly, I cannot believe the health regulator's (if one exists) allow such place to stay open. We have paid for 2 nights accommodation at Novotel Siam Square. What a relief!",1,-0.69
Love our stay . It was so great  stay in the hotel with affordable rate Nuce staff and very convenient to gk kn shopping Will stay the same place next time  Nice place to relax and enjoy the breakfast. Love it,5,0.9737
"We booked our reservation through Agoda. Everything went well, we stayed four days at Prince Palace, but when we were checking out, the hotel asked us to pay for the rooms. Which we had already payed for through Agoda.  We had to leave for the airport, but contacted Agoda immediately after arriving back at Denmark. Demanding not paying DOUBLE for our stay at Prince Palace Hotel.  Agoda has been in a dialogue with Prince Palace Hotel regarding the double payment, which Prince Palace Hotel gladly received.   The message from Agoda is that Prince Palace are not willing to return the extra payment. We have tried reaching out to Prince Palace, explaining that they have charged us DOUBLE for our room, but they are not willing to return the money that rightfully belongs to us.   So I",1,0.1027
"We stayed at the Prince Palace Hotel for 3 nights. The hotel has an excellent location, not far from the Grand Palace, Wat Pho, China Town and other attractions. The rooms are nice and comfortable, a bit old-fashioned, but clean. The hotel staff are kind and friendly. Breakfast was nice, but there was no coffee maker, only instant coffee - not very tasty. The hotel has 2 swimming pools with not too many sunbeds and it is very difficult to find free one. People don't return towels to the reception when leaving the pool, so it's difficult to know if a sunbed is being used or not. I can highly recommend the hotel and I would definitely stay there again on my next visit to Bangkok.",4,0.9651
First impressions of this hotel is WOW. The décor is fabulous and has plenty of facilities although a little on the pricy side.   It has 4 towers and 32 floors. 2 pools both outdoors. Gym blah blah.  The room was very spacious with plenty of storage space.  No balcony but with the poor air quality you really did not want it.  The breakfast is buffet sytle and covers most tastes.  The are so many different room choices and suites too.  We were upgraded FOC when the room we checked into was not clean and the electrics did not work.  The staff are helpful but it can be hard going to get them to understand.  The food outside of breakfast times is quite expensive for Thailand and your are better to travel into town or use the street venders.  The price of the hotel was very,4,0.382
I have been to spa with my wife her and l'm so lucky because Therapist here help me to find cake for Surprise my wife Birthday so we very happy the service here and sure when we come Thailand will looking for your service a gain. Thank you very much Mod,5,0.9632
If you want good stay for a good price. The location is near a market place (bo bae) but at a 20-30min walk to Chinatown or 45 min to Khao San rd and surroundings. A regular tuk tuk ride will be necessary sometimes. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Breakfast is full and will satisfy you.,4,0.9508
"I do not know what has happened to the famous Thai ""Land of Smiles"" slogan - it certainly is missing in this hotel amongst many of its staff.   We stayed here two weeks ago for one night and checked in again today for two nights on our way back home. A woman at the messy reception check-in counter when we arrived today: no smile, no ""hello"", no ""welcome"", but just: ""passport"". Shocking.   Two weeks ago when we stayed here on our way to the islands, the two male members of the staff at the pool bar first completely ignored us when we tried to ask them for directions to the other pool area and then brushed us off with a wave of a hand and one sentence reply (which did not help us to find the pool).   Also, totally overpriced. 80 baht for a bottle of water when around the corner",2,-0.6933
Last month l have been Spa here Therapist very Professional she do very good massage for me.I love they service and will recommend to my friends sure! And also the hotel location very good for shopping it easy to travel with the boat that so amazing,5,0.9789
"no the best but not the worst, just not happy I forgot my glasses in the room but no one could find them, called many times and seams like he earth had swallowed hem whole. little frustrated that they don't offer iron for use cos of old electrics think they need to update their electric cables",3,-0.3108
"We arrived at night to the palace, and we got the room immediately. We stayed at the 24 floor, and I must say I’m a bit disappointed. The floor had this weird smell as it’s use to be a smoking area before. The floor has carpeted and it was a bit dirty and didn’t felt fresh at all. The bed was after all soft. The breakfast buffè was ok, but I just couldn’t get of this feeling that the hotel isn’t fresh at all. The hotel as it’s own restaurant and the drinks there are so expensive. I would say that the hotel is good located, it’s about 40 minutes from the airport. Unfortunately I wouldn’t go back, and I don’t think it has its right to be a 5-star hotel.. ",3,0.5346
"We arrived at this supposed 5* hotel to stay at the Suites. The hotel looked reasonable but a little dated. Check in was on the 11th floor and we were given 3 rooms in Tower B. We followed the route past the lovely swimming pool and some grand ball rooms. When we got to our rooms we were sorely disappointed. The rooms stank and were very outdated. We called reception and they sent house keeping, they took us to 3 rooms on the floor above but they were worse, even the corridor had a putrid smell. I demanded to speak to a manager who gave us three rooms in Tower A which were reasonable but still not 5*. At least they reacted and dealt with our issue. The hotel is in a good location so that was handy for the Grand Palace and China town. If you go make sure you get a quality room",2,0.7579
"Look, this place is due for a make over. Its tired. Wifi only available in reception which is terrible. However the roof top pool is amazing! Great place to just relax and forget the hustle of Bangkok. 10 mins from MBK Shopping, around 100Baht during the day and 200 Baht at night. Nothing really close by to this hotel within walking distance, so be prepared to use Taxi's. Close to a hospital which is important. A short taxi ride to Train Night Market. Breakfast is ok - nothing wow for the price. Service at front desk is terrible.  I have stayed at Prince palace now 3 times &amp; only stay for the massive rooftop pool. Great at Easter time",4,0.8441
Absolutely loved the hotel. Noticed quite a few people from the same flight so I presume this must be well known. Eclectic range of clients and all seem very friendly as do the staff. Bad points.. Only choosing to stay here for 3 nights at the beginning of our Asia tour  We will be back for a few nights before we fly home,5,0.742
"location is superb  , centre of bangkok, easy to shop clothes  just beside the hotel.   for dinner  it is kind difficult to find food surronding hotel , lucky have 7 eleven, fruit market, and street food .  breakfast at hotel is very good,  but the menu all time same.  pool is also good to crowded with big size number of rooms hotel.  very nice hotel eventough looks old.  service hotel  is good.  over all , i enjoy staying at the hotel  ",5,0.9786
I am still at this beautiful hotel nothing to say from the abundant breakfast and the large rooms with all the comforts welcoming but difficult staff to communicate the rest everything perfect hotel with swimming pool Spa fitness center and more a special thanks to the waitress on the floor that to our  return made us find the room always clean .our room is 2913 on the 29th floor with a view I recommend this hotel I state that I also work as a concierge in a 4-star hotel in Rome and I am an excellent observer,5,0.9853
We booked the hotel bundled with air ticket. It was unexpected that they cover all floors with carpets. I got flu in the whole stay because of my allergy acting up. The room was big but the sockets was far from the bed. The pool bar was okay. But hardly to understand their English.,3,0.1406
"Old furnished, but really clean, nice pool, good breakfast, helpful staff. We liked the location, but the neighborhood is not so good. There is a 7 eleven behind the building and you can find a canal boat stop as well. And the view, we really liked it. ",4,0.9813
"This property is located in Old Town Bangkok, which seems to have kept most of the charm of its heyday. Taxi ride from the airport was less than 30 mins. The entrance appears modest, but make no mistake; The hotel is quite expansive with Bobae Market occupying the bottom floors and the hotel/restaurants upwards to the 30th floor.   The front desk staff on the 11th floor were very friendly and helpful as we checked into our Executive Suite. Mr. Somtam was especially friendly and gave us advice in what was open during ""Father's Day"" with where to go and what to do. Value? I believe one is hard pressed to find a comparable 68 sq. m. room (suite) w/sweeping  200 degree views of the city, close to Wat Arun, Wat Pho &amp; Grand Palace at that price point.   We chose to get a bite to eat",4,0.9528
"Very dated, run down rooms. Air con died during our stay.....got to 42 degrees in there..... 2 hours and 4 calls to reception later someone comes up.... they tell us to leave it off for an hour and it will come right!? Unbearable hot in the room so i went down to reception to ask for help AGAIN.... was moved rooms finally after 3 hours. Very disappointed in our stay over all, staff were rude at times and would not recommend anyone stay 🤨",2,-0.8719
"Great location, warm welcome, rooms are very small &amp; dated not very clean. Bugs are found. Room for 4 has cups for 3 .... request more, however never turned up. Stayed 3 nights. Many choices at breakfast with terrible cheap coffee. The pool bar food was very good with great staff. Helpful and accommodating for special requests, for allergies, allergies and vegetarian don’t appear to be catered very well.Concierge were helpful for taxis and advice.   ",3,0.9615
"The hotel itself is lovely, great swimming area and restaurants. The room we stayed in was pretty basic, but we didn’t expect a lot for what we paid.   On arrival we stupidly opted in for the breakfast (330THB) this was expensive to say the least. The breakfast itself was terrible. Cold fried eggs, ham and beans that were disguised as baked beans. All the pastries were dry and tasteless. The cook refused to make me a plain omelette as he had already made some with onions.  Other than the breakfast, the hotel is good. Location ok only a 5 minute tuk tuk from khaosan road and grand palace.",3,0.4767
"Overall, we had a very, very pleasant stay at this hotel. The receptionists are super efficient, polite and courteous, the rooms are very comfortable and spacious, the views are breathtaking and the facilities are wonderful. An amazing outdoor pool with really amazing live music and several restaurants offering a wide range of delicious food, including Thai, Japanese and Chinese. If Bangkok was not such a fascinating city then you would really have no need to leave this wonderful hotel. It is a resort within itself.   We had a quick swim, drank a few beers and stood on the veranda above the pool, taking in what must be one of the best night views of Bangkok, with the skyscrapers all around and the illuminated Wat Arun (Temple of the Dawn) just visible in the distance. A warm",4,0.991
"We were booked to stay here for four nights. We’d booked a two bedroom which was meant to be a king size bed and two singles. We were given a double bed with a single squeezed into one room and a double bed squeezed in to the second room. This place is definitely not a 5 star as advertised. We checked out after the first night. There was fleas or bed bugs in the room, we all spent the night scratching, would go out of the room for a meal with no issues but once back in the room we were being bitten again. The food/drink pricing is ridiculous,$15 aid for a beer.  I guess they charge these prices as there is no restaurants close by. The room was so run down. We were told on check out we would not be given a refund of the three nights. They couldn’t even spare the time to show us",1,-0.3716
"Good hotel, excellent food and ambience. Hotel facilities are excellent and staff are always ready to help. Best tasty FOOD is the highlight of this hotel... just go for it. Value for money . Highly recommended.",5,0.9766
"We were returning customers. We booked this place for two nights (three bedroom suite.)The concierge was very helpful. The reception was alright they're just doing their jobs.   We got checked in around 19.30pm and the laundry has already closed. I was asking for the clothing iron, but there is NO clothing iron available in this hotel. This is basic item for any city hotel to have. I have an important meeting in the morning and I asked the staff for help and they literally said ""theres nothing I can do for you, sorry!""  Then I found a sign in the room that says ironing is banned! Avoid this hotel if you want to go out without wrinkles on your clothes! This stay will be THE LAST TIME. ",1,-0.5898
"Overall a good Hotel. A couple of swimming pools, quite cold to use. Front desk not good at check in, did not have the room we booked - ended up upgrading the the suite - almost double the price of our first room - actually really worth doing.",4,0.7902
"We were there for two days as we were passing from Laos, Camboya and flew from Bangkok back home in October.  The hotel category is 5 star but is far away from 5 star. The instalations are dated and very old. The room was in bad conditions, smelling and staff was not very friendly. They have a bell boy to take the luggage to the room, we came with a lot of luggage as we were travelling for 2 months, but had to take care of ourself of it at arrival. The room we were asigned was very very far from reception, they didnt even explain to us where to go, neither we were escorted to the room.  The breakfast is ok, you have plenty of variety but still not a 5 star category.  They dont offer buffet dinner, I was missing that, only was a la carte.  I was quite disappointed with the staff",2,-0.8692
"To put it simply, avoid this hotel.   We stayed here for 2 nights in November and when we arrived at check-in, we paid for 2 rooms in cash, as well as a 2000 baht security deposit for each room. We expected to receive our 4000 baht back when we checked-out. However, at the time of check out, we were only given 2000 baht back as the hotel claimed this is all we had paid.  When raising this as an issue, the hotel staff were completely unhelpful and continued to deal with other guests whilst we waited at the check-out desk. Finally, the ""Manager"" came to see us and had a video recording of their cctv, which showed their receptionist giving money back to us. This was the change received from when we paid for the rooms, yet the hotel claimed this was the additional 2000 baht even",1,0.5719
"When checking into the hotel, the receptionist charged us 4000 Baht as a security deposit, which we were due to receive back when checking out. When we came to check out on 28/11/19 the receptionist gave us a slip showing that we are owed 2000 Baht.   When questioning the member of staff helping us, she refused to explain why we were only getting half of our deposit back, and continued to serve other guests whilst I was standing at the desk for over an hour waiting for a response from someone. After asking numerous times for an answer we still weren't given any clarity on why were not being given the full amount of money.   Eventually a member of the security team arrived and showed us a video clip of the check in staff handing us money back stating that we only paid 2000 baht",2,0.088
"Booked this hotel at short notice after being disappointed with our Airbnb. We got a good price online, got to hotel and it seemed nice. This is where it all started to go downhill. Paid for the room, then to be told there was an extra 4000 baht to be paid as as additional refundable deposit. Shown to our rooms, which were dull with old decor, but fine for our needs. The major problem occurred when we went to check out, which by far was one of the worst experiences we could have had. As we went to collect our so called refundable deposit, they only gave us back 2000 baht rather than the 4000, after questioning this, they said they had already given us back 2000 baht when we checked in. This was not true, our receipt from checking in showed us paying the 4000. Management told us",1,-0.9127
"Booked this place for a couple of nights for a few reasons, mainly its location being close to the airport train and it had a decent gym.  You’ll notice it’s location is surrounded by slums which you encounter on the street level but the hotel itself is well removed from them. The hotel is pretty old but had amazing decor. Would have been great like 20 years ago.  We booked a room and requested a double bed but was told the room we booked didn’t come with a double bed so my wife and I had to sleep in separate beds. Aside from that disappointment the view was pretty epic as we were on the 30th floor.  The pool area was nice but don’t bother buying food or drinks from there, outrageously overpriced. Well worth hitting the streets for better and cheaper options.  I was impressed",3,0.9869
"We stayed at the prince palace hotel for two nights. We booked the superior room and asked for the highest floor.   The hotel itself is on top of a market building near China Town. Arriving here and driving up the car park made me regret my choice. The area and the car park are dirty and feel like a slum. However, the hotel itself is clean, inviting and had Christmas decorations up everywhere.   We were on the 30th floor with a great view of the city. The room itself was decorated nicely but they failed to mention that the superior room only comes with two single beds, not one big bed.   We booked the buffet breakfast which was quite good, but not worth the $20AUD price.    Gym was huge and had lots of equipment, it was a little old but everything you needed for a great workout.",3,0.9625
"This hotel was ok. Older style decor, but clean.  I booked a room for 2 adults and 2 children. When I went through the booking it would only let me book 2 breakfasts, not 4. I booked the two, knowing that I would need to book &amp; pay for the children's breakfast when we got there, but I put a note on my booking stating that we would need breakfast for 4 people, not 2. When we got there to check-in, I asked about paying for the extra breakfasts and they wanted to charge me 1000bhat ($50) PER CHILD for breakfast!!!! I questioned it &amp; they pulled out their 'policy' in which it stated that you had to pay that... I refused, said that we wouldn't feed the children breakfast (!) and left it.  The next morning, we all went to breakfast &amp; I told them I needed to pay for two children's",3,-0.497
The lobby and other areas are fine but the rooms are very dated and in need of an upgrade. I didn't try any of the restaurants so can't comment  on that but the prices seemed high. The staff are friendly and helpful. I'm not sure this hotel should retain its 5* status .,3,0.791
"Honestly how could this even be a five star hotel. If you rated it that high you must not travel often. Again beds are rock hard! This room smells so bad I wish I took a smoking room instead. Food medicoure at best. $650 bhats for a tiny steak and four pieces of vegetables. Come on people wake up and go to Canada for some real food, comfy beds where you can actually walk the next day becasue you had a decent sleep! Ugggh three nights left but I am so ready to go home. If you want some class book the Marriot Hotel. This is the worst smelling, uncomfortable hotel I have ever stayed in besides the Lannna Boutique Resort! Giving it a one star is over rated! They must get friends to rate it higher becasue it's a one star at best! 🙄🤯😤",1,0.9277
"The only thing my fiancé and I didn’t like about the Prince Palace hotel was the smell of smoke in our room and how old the place is. It looks like this hotel was beautiful 30 years ago but it has a lot of wear and tear. We asked for a non smoking room but somehow ended up on a floor that smelled like cigarettes. Beside that, we thought the prince palace was great. It’s cheap and the customer service is great. Surprisingly the breakfast buffet was also great.",3,0.9833
We went as a family. Enjoyed the stay with good variety of breakfast. Staff were helpful. Good location with walking distance to boat ferry for going to MBK and nearest MRT. Bit of inconvenience for elders as they are used to hose and not tissue.,4,0.8555
"This is my first time staying in this hotel  because the location is good and  is near the royal palace but i feel  really disappointed that the staff fitness service is very poor in the gym room. I went to the gym room for exercise and I called the staff many times to help me how to use the exercise machine but she didn't hear me. So I walked towards her and i see her was playing with her mobile phone that's why she can't hear me calling. When I reached her, I said I needed some advice on the exercise machines. She didn't understand and walked out of the room. So no staff helping me and  I had to try it myself in the end.",1,-0.0703
We stayed here for 2 nights. The hotel is a little dated but good value for money. We had a 3 bedroom suite which was spacious and had everything we needed. The rooms and bathrooms were all clean.   We had some problems with the air-con which they fixed once notified.   Pool was nice with friendly staff. Overall was a pretty average stay but provided everything we needed to enjoy our time in Bangkok at a very good price.,3,0.981
Hotel is huge. Rooms are amazing. Pool is good with a poolside bar. Staff is very polite and helpful. Has a around Market with cheap shopping options. Food is a disappointment for Indian travellers as no vegetarian options except fruits and also the corridors are bit smelly with non veg food smell. ,4,0.7624
"Beautiful Hotel in downtown Bangkok.  Staff are polite, courteous, very helpful. Many different restaurants. Love the Japanese restaurant on site. Khaosan Road is only 10mins away. The spa is also good. Staff spend their time assessing your needs.",4,0.9545
"If I were to go stay there by just a review then that would be a bit of a risky venture. Well we took that risk but it backfired for sure.  A most dated hotel which though huge and apparently well tenanted is perhaps going strong on the basis of its most exceptional location in the heart of the city and commanding an excellent view of Bangkok city from its tall towers. A really excellent restaurant catering to a sumptuous breakfast spread.  The overall decor is really something into which a lot of thought and work has apparently been put in but The Rooms are tiny, ill ventilated and dingy. On initial entry the suite smelled of disuse.  The kitchenette was an apology for the hotel attempting to pass on a small kitchen sink as a complete kitchenette. No provisions to heat any food",3,0.9552
Prince Palace is beautiful hotel in need of a little renovation in some areas. But from the minuet you enter the hotel the staff are so welcoming and pleasent and helpful. At check in we were upgraded to excutive room it was more a suite than bedroom. The pool area is beautiful andp again staff brilliant. Food very good and well presented both at pool bar and restaurant. Will definitley recommend this hotel. Again the staff are amazing.,5,0.9834
location and surrounding near shopping malls and famous Khaosan Road waking distance. Hotel staff very cooperative and room very specious and clean. Break fast wonderful. Inside hotel 2 swimming pool and sunset bar also,5,0.7693
"The hotel located near by the market so it very crowded and complicated in the morning, but after the market closed this area was very deserted, it hard to find a restaurant near here. But restaurants in the hotel are good with the reasonable price so u can enjoy it and dont need to go out to find another restaurant. My room was located on 19 floor with the nice city view, the bed quite comfortable but the facilities in room was little bit old... They provide the very nice breakfast in the morning!! Lovely swimming pool and pool side bar!!",3,0.9822
Room are big and with comfortable bed. Nice city view from the room. Good Dinning area experience with also a fascinating city view. Polite front desk staffs. Overall quite a happy stay for our 3 nights + 1 extend night,4,0.9531
"I was a little scared at first after reading some of the reviews for this hotel, but I'm glad my family and I picked here! The staff was amazing and updated us from a regular room to a two bedroom suite at no charge. The manager made it his business to check on our family daily and to give suggestions on where to visit. The taxi staff of the hotel was also amazing. There was nothing about our stay in Bangkok that wasn't amazing. This hotel has beautiful decor and the cleanliness is also excellent.",5,0.9844
"After having read the mixed reviews on TA I was sceptical about my stay here, but after spending 2 nights in this hotel I can't understand the all negative comments!  Perhaps not an ultra modern hotel, but Prince Palace was very well kept and had a lovely feel to it.    The breakfast was a very good standard with an international spread. I stuck to the British breakfast and ate delicious tomatoes, fried eggs and potatoes.   Our room was clean and had all the essentialy. Only issue was the very low shower head, which we could not seem to adjust. Would have been impossible to shower were we over 5ft 5!   In terms if negatives,  the staff by the pool bar were a little rude, and the food quality was poor considering the price.   But overall not a bad stay in Prince Palace Hotel. ",4,0.8219
"Would not stay again - Reception nice but room horrible and food awful. Did not realize you have to take a lift to reception or location was in a bad part of town. No access , inconvenient to get to or go anywhere",2,-0.9612
"Various Chinese dimsums are available here. Not so crowded with nice view of the old town Bangkok. The staffs work well to serve us.   However, if you want to drive your car here, you have to climb up to at least 8th floor. So other public transportations are suggested.",5,0.6666
"We just got home and have already booked this hotel for next year. Right from getting off the transfer vehicle we felt like royalty. Our suitcases were immediately taken by the porters and placed in our rooms. We arrived at around 9am and despite check in time not being 2pm we were in our room by 09.30, and what a room it was - huge, with the most amazing view of the city and pool/bar areas (tower B). It was immaculately clean, and had tea/coffee making facilities, a fridge and safe...all included. The bathroom was large and had a big bath and shower. Bedding and towels were changed every day, and also 2 large bottles of water were given. The pool was beautiful, as was the pool bar. Prices were acceptable, and happy hour is from 3pm till 9pm every day, with BOGOF beer (we would",5,0.9661
"First time that I checked out fifteen minutes after checking in, even at the cost of losing money. This is not a nice hotel, the immediate vicinity is run down, the hotel is on the upper floors of a commercial building, it has an overall seedy tone, and rooms are very garish. I don’t recommend for a solo business or leisure traveler. Seems patronized by big tour groups. For $15-20 more much nicer hotels can be found. ",1,0.2524
"This place is absolutely the worst hotel I ever stayed in! And I do a lot of low budget trips. It’s absolutely not worth the money. Every hostel would be better.  The room was stuffy and the AirCon made me sick, but only when I was in the room.  The moment I laid down in the bed every started to itch.  Everything was only and broken.  But at least the staff was nice and the breakfast quite good. ",1,-0.0935

Hotel is bit old but well maintained. There is a beautiful view from the top. Checkin and checkout was quick.  Location: Hotel is located in the BO BAE Market which is a very big whole sale market. It is good for shopping if you want to buy in quantities. Opposite hotel there is a boat station from there you can go to all shopping areas at 9 BHT. it is very cheap and convenient way to go to central.

Pool is nice and gym you need to pay pay 150 baht or 300 baht for jacuzzi a d sauna not free  . 2 pools to choose from one in 11 floor and other by the gym  fitness area. Many restaurant to choose from , but it's better to try real street food  . Khao San rd  is  must to see and the  mahanakhan sky tower and restaurant is a must. Many things to do .  Enjoy.",3,0.9393

Since we arrived early in the morning we were asked to checking at 12:00pm amd the reception and hotel staff were unable to provide us comfortable sitting and breakfast.

"The bellboys at the building ground floor are doing well. The front desk staff at the 11th floor are also courteous and are always ready to give assistance to guests, except for a few who cannot seem to understand or speak fluent English. Not all front desk staff are familiar with tourist areas around the hotel and they still need to check with senior staff members for accurate information. The room is spacious and contains all essential items needed by any hotel guest, especially cold drinking water. The light inside the room is however not bright enough. Housekeeping response to guest requests is prompt and their good service is commendable.   From my wife: I find the hotel service quite good, from housekeeping to concierge to bell hop to front desk to breakfast buffet",4,0.8832

The best method to get to the new city from old city is to use Canal boats. The Tuk Tut drivers constantly badgering where you going, got tad annoying.",3,0.6705
"I really wanted to love this place just based on the name.  It is an older hotel but grand in the scheme that it’s the only “luxury” hotel around that area. I had no idea it was in the middle of a clothing mfg area. There really isn’t much around, except clothing vendors and some street food. Expect lots of flies circling around the street food. We took a chance and ordered. Cheap and actually delicious and plentiful! Pros: breakfast is as everyone says: bountiful and delicious. Get there early or much before it ends. They promptly and quickly remove the food items nearing the close times. Service is quick, food is flavorful and there is something for everyone. Breakfast is $10 but they charged me dbl at the end stating they only took a hold on my cc. Be sure to check. I knew I",3,0.9616

"I booked the accommodation through airasia holidays. i could not pinpoint a fault with my booking, from check in to check out everything was fantastic.  We travelled in two cars to reach the hotel, one with booking confirmation and other without and we were checked in without asking any question just seeing our passport.  Safari dressed lobby people communicating each other via radio guided us through the corridors to reach our room with a pleasant smile on their face. surprised to see the room was well lit with lights and air condition working with cool air.  Two bedrooms with 30th floor view towards the old city in the night and day was beautiful. private open pool for kids to chill out and spa for us.  Three days had best buffet breakfast which i never had anywhere, options",5,0.9798
"The best thing: views, we where in 22nd floor so views were gorgeous. The last good thing is the location and because it is a big tower every taxi driver know, so it is so easy to get there. The room was massive but really dirty and old, carpet and curtains really nasty, don’t walk with barefoot, bed was really confortable, tv wasn’t a tv but we have netflix in our phones, but wifi didn’t work properly. In our room we got a sinister and small door which we couldn’t open. The staff is not nice at all, they talk between them in their language while you are keeping a conversation with them. They try to rise the prices up all the time with food, taxis, and we needed to print out two pages of our tickets they charged us too... not nice at all. The swimming pool is really bad and",2,-0.9713
"The room was spacious with a pleasant view  of the city. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was  clean. one of the mornings we ordered breakfast  which was plain and alright. The  most  disturbing thing however was the fact that even the  staff of the hotel were trying to rip us off . When we asked for a taxi to the airport, they tried to tell us 500 baht when  there is no reason that the cab driver should  activate the meter in his car.  The price  came out to be a third of what they tried to  take from us. To conclude, in a country  where every one is trying to  haggle you , you would  expect a hotel of this calibre to at least not behave in this fashion. ",3,0.6712
"Where to even begin with this hotel. By far the worst customer service I have ever experienced in any hotel. When I arrived and was waiting to check in I saw a  member of staff being incredibly rude to another guest who was discussing something with them. The staff member wouldn’t listen to the guest properly and walked off on her. Then when it was my turn to check in, I had an issue with the WiFi that my phone couldn’t connect and I was brushed aside and spoken to incredibly rudely. They then ignored me and started to discuss things with another guest whilst I was still standing there with my issue unresolved. (I needed WiFi to check had I pre paid for breakfast as I thought I had and they wouldn’t give me the vouchers). I found the staff unbelievably  rude when faced with any",1,-0.9475
When we arrived at the hotel we were asked to go to the Reception on the 11th floor. The check-in was a bit slow. The room is spacious but we received a room that was close to the bar and you can hear the music but they stop around 11'ish something. The breakfast is okay. Lots of tourist in the morning. Some of the staff does not understand English at all. We booked for a double bed and we received 2 small beds. We travel in by groups 9 adults 1child. The location area is near the bobae market and bobae tower. Food wise you need to eat at the hotel not much restaurant close by.,3,0.5719
"Overall you have the basic hotel needs for a real low price so would recommend this only for non-fussy people. Room was very spacious, a tad old but awesome view of Bangkok city with the river &amp; skyline. Housekeeping was quick to bring our room requests. TV's small &amp; wifi's okay. Only hassle was when booking Grab-they always go to the other tower so you have to specify always that it's beside Bobae market &amp; across Kasikorn bank then they know already (most drivers were a bit annoyed with that). Breakfast is basic which is okay since we didn't want to eat much and enjoy more of Thai street food. Swimming pool area's great for taking photos of Bangkok view. Location's great as it's quite central so normally between 10-20 minutes to reach attractions and city places. If you want",4,0.9819
"Recently travelled round Thailand and this was probably the worst place we stayed. We had intended to book somewhere nice for the last part of our trip and booked a two bed exec family suite and when we arrived we were so disappointed. The room was dark, cramped, extremely out dated and not very clean. The bathroom was awful and not somewhere I would want to shower. We complained and were offered an exec room which we said was fine if they would put an extra bed in which they did (after a couple of reminders). Thiis room was much better - more spacious and a nicer bathroom. However still pretty dark and the WiFi throughout the hotel was terrible.

Stayed here for 3 nights at the begining of our trip in Thailand  Quick 1 hrs ride in traffic by taxis from AIrport (sarcastic).... Take taxis from airport and ensure they use meter. Grab taxi ticket from public area and ensure meter is used. Have some small bills ready for toll 25 baht and 50 baht as you approach the city. (Superrich on B1 level of Terminal has best X rate even better than banks in city) There is a 50 baht airport surcharge too. The metre showed about 320 bhat + these charges so under 500 bht to hotel and that's thru traffic. Much better than lugging luggage around  Note lobby is on upper floor not ground floor.

"The first thing you notice about this place is that it's massive.  Four towers, on top of 10 levels of clothing stores (trade outlets mostly).  The place is huge and plush.  The included breakfast was ok, very crowded between 8 - 10am and had NO BACON.  There are a few pools to choose from and the main resort-style pool and adjoining bar is pretty dear to drink/eat at.  It seemed popular with families and outside the confines of the hotel are heaps of places to eat.  Patpong Road was 3km one way and the MBK centre 2km the other way so it's well placed.  A Tuk Tuk ride anywhere was no more than 200 Baht - $9 AUD",4,0.8792

A very good relax and having fun around the pool (very important after all seeing about and around), great breakfast: mixture of European and Asian cuisines, order  food service in the eve, luxurious halls and lobby interior, hospitable staff.

"I stayed with my family for two nights in this hotel. First of all, check in is available to do from 2 pm, we arrived at 3 pm and they asked us to wait 20 mins first and then 10 mins more because the room was not cleaned yet. Secondly, the way from my room to the lobby (and swimming pool also) takes 10 or even 15 mins. Also, I saw few times housekeepers with big bed sheet’s trollies using the guest elevators. I think it is not proper way of doing it, they are supposed to use staff elevators for that. One more thing that the room didn’t have any toothbrushes and even we had kitchen without plates and cutlery. Fourthly, I asked a girl at the reception to call the restaurant for me and book a table for my family, she declined and said that “we don’t really have time to care about",1,0.5106

We asked for an Ironing board &amp; iron to press some of our clothes but we were told that it was not available. A 4 /5 star hotel should surely have this service.

"This hotel is quite deceiving IMO. I was very excited to stay in the Prince Palace Hotel but I was surprised to see the difference when we arrived. The photos make the hotel look very grand and luxurious, when in reality it is very outdated and need some TLC.   We checked in early as our flight was an early flight, so we didn’t expect our room to be ready. We left our cases with concierge and went to check in/let them know we had arrived. As expected, our room wasn’t ready, but there was no where for us to stall our hand luggage. Not my handbag either, our suit case hand luggage.
