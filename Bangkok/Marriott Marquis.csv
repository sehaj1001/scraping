"A wonderful oasis at the Sukhumvit, closed to BTS and MRT, Shops, excellent management and staff, delicious food - perfect service to everybody even it is a big hotel with more than 1'300 rooms. My sister and I stay now since more than two years in this great hotel",5,0.9669
"Excellent hotel in BKK with well-trained staff that make you feel at home.  Location close to BTS Phrom Phong is perfect for business or leisure.  Well equipped gym, 2 pools and state of the art spa ""Quan"" to be recommended.  Limousine-airport service by hotel very reliable, safe driver and clean SUV. Friendly staff already awaiting your limousine at hotel, leading you to room for in-room check-in.  M Club Lounge offers tasty breakfast and dinner with a choice of beverages and even cocktail bar and cosy terrace. Director of room and M Club team at reception desk is present and helpful at all times. Thank you very much for your hospitality!",5,0.9749
"My partner and I are living in Koh Samui, we love our island life and we also like to have city getaway every while and then. It might sound a bit crazy to have holiday in Bangkok at this moment but this stay with Marriott Marquis Bangkok was a total blast, everything was well arranged even under such harsh situation. temperature check while everyone enter the hotel and hand sanitize everywhere. It's a shame that we didn't get to visit ABar due to the government policy during corona-virus out break, but we get to have the amazing dinner in Goji for the last night they open - thanks to Pak and his team, they are simply amazing. One little thing that can be better is, on the last night of our stay, we were informed that the M Club Lounge will be closed as all of the hotels are",5,0.9704
"Stayed for 5 nights during the beginning of the COVID-19 lockdowns and felt that management and staff employed strategies to make us feel safe and secure. That aside, this hotel is a truly five star facility where you can enjoy wonderful food and beverages, great rooms, fast wifi, M Club Lounge privileges in classy surroundings with an authentic Thai touch to the decor even down to the staff attire.",5,0.9741
"This is the 2nd time I bought this package with the agent.  Everything is very good deal with a small change on the offer from last time.  You always feel warm  welcome by their staffs.  Sad to say business is drop due to the COVID 19.  No matter what, will definitely come back again.  Just a note I would like to express the kindness of their staff, Zunk, working at the check-in date:    I bought the 3 nights package via an agent on Feb 10.  Due to the short notice and their system only accepts booking on Feb 12.  I called the hotel directly if I could change the check-in for Feb 11 but both the front desk and the reservation were gone for the day.  Both Renaissance Hotel in Pattaya and myself have hard time to get hold of the Marriott Marquis on Feb 11 morning.   So I just take",4,0.6183
"As a frequent traveler the first day at the property makes a huge impact on my total impression. While arriving at the Marriott Marquis from the minute that the car door opens you can feel/tell that you came to the right place. My luggage got picked up and tagged by the professional concierge team and then I was guided directly into the check in counters, and here that elevated/outstanding hospitality approach begins. Was greeted by a super professional team member of the Marriott Mister Poom which I believe he's a front desk executive, his service and manners was something I rarely encounter in other properties. Mister Poom was polite and courteous his English skills and knowledge about where I came from were remarkable, I was briefly explained about the hotel amenities and",5,0.9442

Our twin room was a decent size and well-appointed. I was excited to find a bathtub in our bathroom but then realised that it would not be a comfortable experience (short tub but very deep) which turned out to be the case. The lobby area is beautiful and the staff were amazing. A wonderful breakfast and lunch buffet is available although I didn't try the other eateries. About 45 minutes transfer from the airport and a good location to base yourself in Bangkok. My only issue was the pillows but I was there for just 4 nights so didn't ask if they could change for me.,5,0.9625
"Great place and nice location The hotel is way too big and corporate oriented ,however if you looking for a good combination between convenient and still good standards I will definitely recommend it ,for me the highlight was the club floor upgrade ,service is good  the manager Kitty very attentive and run her team nice and very professionally ,the outdoor area is very pleasant and comfortable for smokers ,variety of food and drink is pretty good maybe a small tips would be the coffee  is definitely not up to expectation and I am not a heavy coffee drinker but can recognize that quality lack somehow .......

"Our weekend at Marriott was amazing. From the moment we arrived the staff were friendly and welcoming, ready to assist where they can. The hotel facilities are amazing. We opted for the club floor access and was very impressed with what was on offer. Definitely worth the upgrade. We will be back to experience this great hotel again",5,0.9819
"Our second stay here. Very close to large shopping complex. beautiful park for walking, close to public transit and the LARGEST &amp; BEST BREAKFAST BUFFET I have ever seen.

Staff is very helpful and Concierge has tips on local and not so local restaurants/bars/activities. Never a disappointment.",5,0.971
I have been to a lot of hotels around the world and this hotel has to be one of the best I have been to.The staff are very friendly and welcoming and are willing to make your stay as comfortable as possible. On checking in I was met by the duty manager Rachel who told me about the facilities on site and was very friendly with my two year old son. During my stay I upgraded to a suite and found the reception staff are very helpful especially Poom and Aira Who made this transition very smooth. #GreatTeam,5,0.9672
"The Hotel Marriott Marquis was absolutely divine. From the moment of arrival in the stunning, beautifully scented foyer, we were treated like royalty. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff, particularly the Guest Service Supervisor, Poom, who went out of his way to assist us. The breakfast in the Goji Kitchen was sensational with every kind of food you can imagine and great coffee! The hotel is situated next to Queen's Park, a beautiful spot in Bangkok and a lovely place to walk off all the breakfast! The hotel location is very good too, just off Sukhumvit Road and a 25 minute drive to the airport. We did this trip as a Luxury Escape and can not recommend them enough. A fabulous experience!",5,0.9832
Amazing trip this year. I really feel at home. The  staff was welcoming and the reception staff was very helpfull. I had an early check in and a super upgrade in a junior suite. The service at the M Lounge was fantistic ! Thank you all for this lovely stay!,5,0.9595
"I stayed here for over forty nights and I absolutely enjoyed my stay. What make this hotel special is the staff and their care to accommodate the guest. M Club staff on the 27th Floor is amazing. The food and drinks was great. Every night there is are new items to try and the food is prepare in front of you by multiple cooks. The cook member Bow, is a very talent cook and extremely polite by ensuring she explains the ingredients and providing advice to all guest about other items of interest. Service members Dew, Noon, Sandy, Gift, Kitty, and Komal provided exceptional services throughout my stay and they make everyone feel like an important Club member. I absolutely recommend this hotel.

"Great hotel to stay in if you are looking for a city break in Bangkok. I visited with some friends and had a great experience. We had lounge access and one way airport transport with our room rate which also included breakfast at the lounge (enough for a small eater) or at the restaurant for big eater, free flow select cocktails for lunch and dinner 5-9:30. Between 5-7:30 there is hot food in the lounge too. The staff were super friendly, location was very central for tailors, mall, food, spa, taxi, etc. Rooms were spacious enough for 2 adults (non-couple) with mini-fridge and plenty of storage. Rooftop area is nice but if you are looking for drinks take note one bar is only a gin bar. The style inside is nice too, really can't go wrong...price was S$350 for 2 nights for 2",5,0.9473
The Marriott was Amazing. Absolutely mind blowing upon arrival! The reception was extremely organised and a nice vibe filled the atmosphere. A good amount of staff always helping with questions and the place was spotless. Effortless check in and very friendly and helpful staff. We were on the 29th floor with views of the city and the pool. We also had access to the M Lounge and wow.. is all I can say. The food was delicious both breakfast and dinner! Staff were very nice. Needless to say I will definitely be returning here!,5,0.9815
Staff went above and beyond to help me with my travels and special accommodations. Rooms and hotel was very clean. The food in the restaurants was excellent and the hotel was close to parks and other attractions I plan on staying here whenever I come back to Bangkok.,5,0.9312
"I have stayed at this hotel a total of 4 weeks now over 3 different stays. The service is always amazing. The rooms are spacious, clean and extremely comfortable. The area around the hotel is also one of my favorites. I love the small park behind the hotel, which is a great place to have an early morning or evening walk before it gets too hot outside. One of my favorite things is the recognition I get from staff. It is great walking into the lounge and they remember who I am.",5,0.9823
"My recent third stay here was perhaps the most memorable of them all; we received a personalized welcome upon arrival from Anrdia, an absolutely gracious and lovely Filipina who showed us straight to our room, allowing us to check in there and avoid the crowds downstairs, a truly classy move on their part.   One of the reasons we enjoy returning to this hotel is due to the warmth of the lounge staff and quality of their offerings; it was wonderful to see Mew who remembers us from visit to visit and always stops to have a little chat and see if we need anything.   Similarly, khun Kitty, lounge manager, helped arrange rooms for my parents and I all on the same floor in advance and got right back to me whenever I emailed her. She runs a tight ship, and it shows.

"I have stayed in many different Hotels in Bangkok, and this is surely in the top, also as it is good value for money. Location with easy access to Mall and transport. The streets around are okay, and a nice small park right next door. As Titanium Bonvoy I was upgraded and that surely helped my valuation of the stay. The Marriott Lounge was great and Check-in there very fast and friendly. Sonya was there most of the time and she was very helpfull - great service. There is a lot of people in the Lounge at peak times, but still the food was very good, and selections of drinks impressive.",5,0.9747
I will rate this hotel overall 5****  Hotel Lobby - One of the best Marriott hotels i had visited 5*  Hotel Receptionist /Checked In - Arya  very accomodating and welcoming  Hotel M lounge - 5* service with all the crew. Snacks/ Bfast/Dinner and Alcohol/cocktails are the best! Worth the money  GOJI restaurant - 4* Food is almost the same for my whole stay with the Hotel.  Hotel Pool toilet - This is the only downside of the hotel (not really maintain properly specially the shower area near sauna/steam room (a bit smelly and moldy) too sad to experience this.   Overall. I will book and stay again in the future. ,5,0.8675

"We have just spent 11 days at this hotel and will certainly go back if we need an hotel in Bangkok. Although using Marriott Reward points, we were treated as very special guests and made to feel most welcome from the moment we checked in to the time of departure. Our room was upgraded to a suite and it was an unexpected pleasure. The accommodation could not have been better. We had access to the M Lounge which is superbly managed by  Kitty Manaporn. She and her entire staff go the extra step to ensure that all their guests feel at home and have everything that they need. Kitty is a credit to the Marriott Group.

"Probably my 15th stay at the Marriott Marquis Queens Park, and each stay is as good as the earlier one if not better. Very consistent hotel. Room, service, amenities, staff attitude and helpfulness, just excellent. Great value for money in my view. I am a Ambassador elite member and their responsiveness is simply outstanding. I tried a some other properties in the last couple of years but came back to Marriott Marquis as they are just unbeatable.   Highly recommend this property for short or long stays and for business or pleasure. Will be back with my family soon.   Keep it up Marriott Marquis Queens Park!!!  Vishal",5,0.9634
"This is our second trip to Bangkok, we were last here in June 2018. Given the current travel climate and the wide range of choices available to customers, we still chose to return to the Marriott Marquis Queens Park. We are so glad we did. Apart from the fact that the hotel is in immaculate condition and stunningly presented, the staff here are absolutely fantastic. Everyone is so willing to help. You are politely greeted everywhere you go in the hotel and assistance is offered with anything you need.  We are staying with MClub lounge access and it's worth every penny!

"In short, our stay was awesome.  We stayed at several different hotels In Bangkok and ended staying at Marriott Marquis.  It is relatively better location in comparison to JW Marriott.  Soi 22 is a small and busy street.  We often use rear entrance of the hotel, which is much closer to light rail station and department stores, grocery store and food courts.  Also, rear entrance connects to Queen's Park, and nice and much easier to walk with heavy traffic.  The hotel has a great gym equipped with Life Fitness equipment.  Awesome!!  The hotel has two towers, North and South.  Both have club lounge on 27th floor.  South tower has much bigger lounge.  Both have outdoor spaces for smokers.

I even know the names of the staff and they know me. I find this amazing and the service is extremely good. The a amenities of the hotel are great and breakfast is fabulous. I use to be able to use the M lounge with my gold status ! Unfortunately Marriott has downgraded all there members with Bonvoy , their new loyalty program ! As a guest, I find this a big downside ! I believe that Martiott has left many status customers disappointed due to the downgrade of the benefits as well as the increase of the redemption options. However, I still like to stay here for the amazing and attentive service ! :-)",5,0.9829

Furthermore- this great team even assist me to book for another Marriott hotel at different country while I was between flights. While arriving to the hotel, the hotel's representatives helped me to get out of the taxi and offered, with great politeness, their assistance with my luggage and from there actually led me throughout the magnificent Lobby to the check-in desk.

Breakfast is great but a pain because of hundreds of people running around the area with their plates. Elevators can take quite a while when its full. During government conferences you may be inconvenienced by security points/metal detectors when trying to enter the hotel and traffic can be congested because of this as well.   -Check-in can take a while sometimes.  -Haven't had a room yet (over 20 stays) where the aircon in the room actually",5,0.9695

"We stayed at Bangkok Marriott for 2 nights recently. The stay was beyond amazing. All the staffs we come across were extremely helpful and always ready to fulfill our needs. Special mention to Archie, Guest Service Agent, for fast check-in and giving us a room with astonishing view. That really make our stay very memorable.  All in all, everything about this place is tremendous. We absolutely recommend you to stay here. 10/10",5,0.9595
"My wife and I did a trip to Bangkok in September last year through Luxury Escapes. We enjoyed it so much we returned in December.   The hotel we stayed at was the Marriott marquis and is Just fabulous, the staff are just fantastic.   I fully understand the risk with the current situation in China, however, I hope people continue to support to the hotel. I know you'll love it, we did. Just wear a mask.   The food, rooms and service is second to none.  Enjoy.",5,0.9486
"Fully enjoyed my stay at the Bangkok Marriott Marquis, it is definitely a marquee hotel.  Room was great, but the crown jewel is the M Lounge.  Buffet Breakfast great selection of fruits eggs cooked to order, one of the best M lounges I have visited.",5,0.9698
Huge place. Attentive staff and very helpful. Special thanks to the lobby entrance doorgirls as they stand there for hours to open the door and greet you as well as help you around the place. They should be expose more on the check-in counter and the restaurant/cafe. Room is clean. Great 27th executive lounge. Will definitely return when i am in bangkok.,5,0.9767
"Bonvoy elite insight  I have visited this hotel many times. The M lounge used to be the flagship of Marriott lounges. This is no longer the case.  Lounge Breakfast is subpar compared to the past. Still offers some veriery , but apart from the standard omelet station there is one more hot dish each day and it's not an impressive one. Cooking level and quality falls and Insufficient.  Lunch was erased from the schedule. No lunch , just peanuts between 10:30 to 5:30 Disappointing.  Dinner cocktails from 5:30 again falls short compared to the past. Cooking level , hot dishes verity and quality of food is lacking.  I believe that management knowingly decided to cut lounge resources. That is sad. They opened a twin , smaller lounge on the south building , resources might have split",5,-0.9575
"Had previously stayed here and had a bad experience. The response from management was to invite me back. After looking at how many positive reviews this property had I took management up on the offer. Second stay was flawless. As others have said this is a very busy hotel. Regardless, all staff were professional and friendly. Check in was quick and efficient. Breakfast at Goji was amazing. So many foods to choose from. All were deliscious. Location of the hotel is perfect. Five minute walk to the BTS or the mall. Very highly recommend the Marriott Marquis.",5,0.9664
"We came for a family staycation during Chinese New Year with our baby. The hotel is tucked in Soi 22 of a very busy road in Bangkok, but access to it is made simple (more in that later).   Upon arrival we noticed it was obviously a popular spot as they have check in lanes for group tourists and agencies. However, it was not difficult to find the Bonvoy members lane and check in was very smooth there. The staff at the counters were super friendly and they go the extra mile to ensure that everything is in order.   We were invited to a Chinese New Year celebration, which was an extravaganza with lion and dragon dances and fireworks etc. It is always nice to see something cultural when staying at a hotel during festive times.  Our room on a high floor offered a fabulous view of the",5,0.9869
"Everyone knows Marriott provides excellent services, but staffs at Bangkok Marriott Marquis Queen's Park have just offered us exceptionally great services that I can only dream for.   My heartfelt thanks to Archie from Bangkok Marriott Marquis' guest relations office. From day one she aware that we are celebrating our daughter's 8 year old birthday, she gave us lots of surprise during our stay: not only birthday cake but also hand written greeting cards for days, and with balloon decorations in our room on my girl's big day. She even arranged a group of staffs with guitar to sing birthday song to us during our dinner buffet. Even more amazing is she decorated our room the day after with those nicely taken photos during the birthday celebration. Archie also invited us to join",5,0.994
The best breakfast buffet! They offer everything and anything that you can think of. It defines an international buffet!  The room is comfortable. Facilities are great. Note that the pool only gets the sun until noon.  Service is fantastic! A excellent stay! ,5,0.9685
"This has always been my go to hotel every time I am in Bangkok. Among Marriott brand hotels in this region, I can safely say that this is one of the best. Amenities is top notch.   The minor details that stands out. The hidden light in the bathroom is a god send. waking up at night for quick visit to the toilet does not require me to fumble for the switch. I can just go do my business and back to sleep.",5,0.8834
We stayed here for 3nights. Lovely room and view. the M Club lounges are very nice both north and south towers.

"Reviewed in May 2019, and my return visit was just as memorable as the first.  Will not repeat everything again.  Please see my original review.  As things can change in hotels and restaurants just want to say the operation continues to run smoothly with above average service and accommodations.  One caveat, if you need to use one of the hotel's computers, lets say for printing a doc., they are all Apple, no other choice, so this might be a problem if you are not knowledgeable with Apple system.

"We were in the city and hotel for two days over Christmas for a big Indian wedding. There were a large number of us being hosted at the hotel and the wedding and related activities during both days were spread over many of the hotel's banqueting and function rooms. The service and lavish food at all the ceremonies were more than excellent and we sampled many international cuisines apart of course from our favourite Thai food. The guest rooms were of good size and comfortable although I not a fan of this trend of a big glass partition between the room and bathroom. The hotel breakfast restaurant, the Goji Kitchen, was huge but still inadequate for the sheer size of the hotel. Lavish and sumptuous breakfast laid out but a bit chaotic with a long line to get a table, counters",5,-0.4482
"This was our first time visiting Bangkok. After a misunderstanding with Luxury Escapes we were left stranded at the airport. We happened to locate a Marriott employee (Nan) and she was outstanding. She arranged for a car to come and pick us up and gave us some peace of mind after a stressful hour. Upon arrival at the hotel the staff were so welcoming. We were checked in by Boy and he couldn't do enough to find out what had happened to our transport. He said he would follow it up and he did and sent me an email with what to do. The rooms are clean, modern and we had a great view of the park and city. It's a magical place to look out over at night. Apart from our sink in the bathroom staying plugged unless we physically lifted it everything else was excellent. We had room service",5,0.9527
"This is the 3rd time we booked this hotel with club lounge benefits. We always received a warm welcome from all the staff at the 27th floor M Club lounge and would specially like to thank Chatzy, Gift, AE, Sandy and Maprang for their friendliness and excellent service to us. They are one of the reasons to make us come back too!  We also enjoyed a complimentary drink at Abar located at 37th floor, nice atmosphere and fantastic night scene!  Room is clean and spacious, bed is comfy. Still no increase in the TV channels which we mentioned previously but not an issue. Overall we enjoyed our stay and looking forward to come back again!

"I've stayed at this property around 4/5 times. Each time I discover something new because it's quite a large hotel with plenty of places to experience. And I mean experience, not just walk thru.  Their restaurants, spa, health club, fitness center - all have staff who know their job so well. And they make you feel special.  I highly recommend experiencing their executive lounge. The staff there, and those at the Bonvoy desks, are exceptional.   Of special mention are Ae &amp; Nadia. Nadia manages the Bonvoy program and Ae is in the Exec Lounge. Super attention, they remember your name, your fav drink and always always greet you with a sperkle in their eyes and a bright smile.  Thank you ladies.",5,0.9801
"This a very large hotel (1400 rooms ), too large for my taste. However, if you are an American, visiting Bangkok, and want the best of both worlds, it's perfect!  Spacious, modern rooms with American amenities and wonderful air conditioning. The beds are comfortable with crisp sheets and soft comforters.   Rooms have a safe, ironing board, complimentary coffee, robes, slippers, fridge, desk and American electrical outlets. The toiletries are standard Marriott brand.   I found check in confusing because there are multiple (5-7) checking desks. But the clerks were friendly and efficient. All spoke passable English.   I ate every meal in the M Lounge which is the hotel's concierge level club. Meals there were  fantastic and filling. There's an omelette station for breakfast and an",5,0.9851

We were interviewing candidates and the exec team were exemplary in their interactions with them and us. In particular Mew stood out as a key link person and I cannot praise her enough, often anticipating our requirements before we asked.

"Had a brief stay in Bangkok for business and this hotel was perfect. Room was nice, clean, excellent facilities to work from as well as relax in. Breakfast buffet was sensational.

Super fast and efficient check in and check out too!",5,0.9829
"Before we arrived I had arranged with Archie, the Guest Relations Officer, to have some balloons in our suite for my boyfriend's birthday. The room far exceeded all expectations and the extra warm welcome, set up, and service were fantastic. I couldn't recommend using her services more if you are looking for something extra special to make your trip. The hotel was beautifully styled, modern with a fantastic rooftop bar with amazing gin cocktails. If you are able to, I'd recommend staying in a suite as you get many extras including food and drink in the evening and a stunning room. The hotel was perfectly located for us to explore every area of Bangkok that we wanted to and with Grab taxis available immediately, it was the perfect city break we needed.",5,0.9827
Stayed here based on reviews and they didn't fail.   Amazing friendly service with a smile. Nothing was too much  and the staff accomodate in every way they can.  Stayed on level 26 lovely big spacious rooms with a 6 an d4 year old in a double room but with ample space.   Bathroom was very clean and spacious and a very large shower area and powerful pressure with shower which was great.  Had access to the M lounge which was brilliant staff are excellent. Lew was very polite talkative and professional.   Evening wine reception is great with a selection of sprits and a cocktail menu which you can make yourself or have made for you.  They have two club lounges north tower is for the family and south tower is predominantly not child orientated but this was fine as they are similar,5,0.9891
"It was truly a pleasure staying at your hotel this past week.  I have stayed and lived in Thailand-when I worked at an international school.      I have stayed at other 5 star hotels in Bangkok and I felt that the stay at your hotel was excellent, warm and welcoming.    I especially appreciated the omelette chef at the Executive Lounge on the 27th floor.  My omelettes were wonderfully crafted and her friendly and cheery demeanor along with all of the other Executive Lounge staff made my experience the very best.    I chose to visit the Executive Lounge for all the meals that I could since the atmosphere was warm and cozy.    Of course my room was excellent.  While I would have liked to have had a bathtub, the room design and bathroom area were excellent.  The bed and pillow were",5,0.9927

Don't dare to enter their Goji kitchen bar if you are on the diet, you will be seduced by unlimited choices of food and lovely staff. Rooms are modern and equipped with all amenities. Their housekeeping staff is superb. They are just call away for every need. Best is their lounge and staff. TOP and BELLA were extraordinary. Always smiling and ready to help. The cherry on the top was MEW, mixologist at the bar who made fantastic cocktails. One cocktail which was not on the menu, she specially made for us. Thanks, MEW. Last but not least, at check-out time they give us the exact weight for our luggage.",5,0.9563

"Stayed for a week in a club lounge suite which was very nice although not much light from windows. The club lounge is really good and the staff is helpful and deliver a fabulous service.  The do cocktails, wine , food and sparkling wine amongst many other things.  Although the hotel is huge it really doesn't feel like it.  You can access the park straight from the back of the hotel which will take you to the sky train station after a 2 minute walk.  The sky bar is a great asset albeit the music being a bit loud. There are a lot of restaurants on Soi 22 as well as massage bars and convenience stores.  The breakfast is outstanding.  So much choice from all parts of the world. There is also a very well stocked bakery on ground floor selling bread, cakes and biscuits.",5,0.9866
"The experience I had stayed in Bangkok Marriott Marquis was definitely one of the best among the dozen times i have been in Bangkok. Exceptional services to loyal members (Ambassador elite) even compare to the ones provided by other Marriott high-end entities. Highly recommended to other traveller traveling with kids or big families.   1. Exceptional staff: The great services started even before the trip! The loyalty manager, Nadia reached out to me almost a month before my trip to kick-start the discussion on room arrangement and all other details.

The senior special on Tuesday is not to miss, although the staff has problems when you tell them your a senior and has a special price after confirming with someone both times they got the price right I even confirmed it when I made the reservation, now the great food fantastic service is without equal, even in a mega city like Bangkok Gigi never fails to hold itself to the highest standards. I will go back this June for the 5th time and know it will be among the very best Anywhere. Thanks bob hebert",5,0.973

"The Marriott Marquis is my choice when staying in Bangkok. It is a great property in a nice location. The executive lounge staff is one of their greatest assets... They really went over and above for me on this trip. I managed to sustain a sever leg injury on an outing. Nut, Mew, and Sandy went over and above to make me comfortable... Ice, towels, beverages, anything - just like family! When the injury worsened, they jumped into action and got me help from outside the property.  Awesome Job! Also, special recognition for the happiest cook in the world, Nat! She bubbles over with enthusiasm for her job - a Joy! The rest of the lounge staff is wonderful too... can't give enough compliments!",5,0.9836
"We were here during the New Year and gosh the hotel was really busy with loads of guests! No room upgrade at all. The lounge was very busy and we had to wait for a table during happy hour. And another much longer wait to have a table during Breakfast at Goji… it's kind of expected. There were no welcome fruit nor turndown service, unlike what we had during our last visit a year ago.  Despite these trivial things, Sonya who checked us in and out at M lounge provided warm and personalized service. She was attentive and caring, wearing a genuine smile. Her positive attitudes were impressive. We enjoyed a lot chatting with her! She deserves our praise!",4,0.9768

The breakfast buffet was incredible; what a lot of choice and very good quiality. Also the Excecutive Lounge was super. Very friendly staff, good drinks and great food.

Although for some the location is a little way out of the tourist cenre Iloved this hotel. rooms were clean and very comfortable. Roof top bar was superb especially for NYE party we attended. Breakfast was fabulous....so much choice and even when crazy busy it runs so smoothly. The staff are wonderful. Pool is OK but they could do with making more of an effort in what is a large space and could be made fantastic. Love the fact there is some real night life on the streets just outside the hotel. Lots of interesting bars etc.,5,0.9778
This is a huge hotel.Two towers of 35 floors each. Good location with a 10 min walk to Skytrain and access to all of Bangkoks sights. Executive lounge had good breakfast and pre dinner food but was always packed and LOUD. We had the feeling that there were many using the lounge who were not high status Bonvoy members.,4,0.6486
"I only stayed 1 night on a business trip, and was really impressed with the place. It still has the look and feel of a shiny new hotel as all the facilities and decor are in great condition. It seems to be popular with big groups and air crew so even though there were 8 staff on the check in desks, we still had to wait a while. Breakfast as great, there is a huge choice and the restaurant is so big it's easy to lose your table after visiting the buffet. The meeting rooms were nice and staff were Super helpful. ",5,0.9791
"I am a guest in the Marriott Marquis Queens Park and I am looking forward to every stay. The staff is extremely friendly, the rooms are nice and the food in general is definetly to be recommended. Two highlights during this trip:  1 - The hotel opened a second M-Club lounge which is a little smaller than the other one but much more quite and it has another meeting room which can be rented for 2h free of charge. 2 - In the huge breakfast area the selection is so big that it took me almost 2 years to discover the Goji Muesli (with the famous Gogi Berry). This is now my favorite muesli and I learned that it is completely house made.  I could make a very long list. This hotel is one of my favorites in the world.",5,0.962
"Centrally located, 3 of us stayed in a twin standard room - big double beds so we didn't end up needing the extra roll-away bed. Might get a bit tight in terms of floor space if you avhe any luggages, otherwise, it's comfortable room, with a decent bathroom.  What we love about the hotel is its many F&amp;B outlets.  Starting with breakfast buffet, LEAVE PLENTY OF TIME for this as there is such a ridiculous amount of food stations that you could have spend 1.5 hours just eating breakfast:)  The roof time restaurant and bar has a gorgeous view of the city, and the thai restaurant served some pretty authentic food when I first arrived.  They also have a beautiful spa and gym.  Only thing is this hotel is full of tourists by the coaches, and airline crew members so the lobby is always",4,0.9481
Our family stayed here for 3 nights before we returns home.  Most impressive lobby I've seen. Great location.   Had access to club level.

We were here on NYE and they offered a roof top party which was fun! ,4,0.967
"I would like to comment on the friendly and efficient service provided at the Executive Lounge during my stay (2nd Consecutive). While most of the staff there is very attentive, would like to specially mention K. Mew, an associate working in the Lounge.  She has been taking care of the guests preferences without having to tell every time what I like and don't like. I observed she does this for other guests as well - after the first visit, if she has served you, you don't need to tell her again.  ",5,0.9601

"I booked this hotel due to a number of reasons, first it's a Marriott hotel so I thought it would be a quality assurance. Secondly the hotels were nice and the location was nice, and also the reviews were quite good in trip advisor so I thought I should just give it a try. Turns out it's nothing like the reviews!   When I first arrived, the first impression was a gigantic hotel with lots of people and tour groups, very crowded. Although it was newly renovated from its old facility but you could still see hint of an old style hotel eg old marble pillars, old marble floors, low ceilings and so on..... the newly renovated furnitures were okay so it's not all bad.   The funny thing was, I waited for around 20 mins to check in only to find that there's already 2 huge luggage already",1,0.9361
"The hotel is well located in Sukhumvit for proximity to transit, shopping, dining and nightlife.  It's quite large and gets somewhat busy, but overall the rooms are great and there is a good pool/gym. Special thanks to Khun Kitty and all the staff in the Executive Lounge. Highly recommend M Club level rooms (particularly the one-bedroom and Marquis suites). There is daily food and alcohol service included with these rooms.",5,0.9724
"This hotel is huge. The lobby has the feel of a Las Vegas casino.  I found it very average.  The rooms, lobby, decor and vibe are all old.  The price was reasonable.  My room had a musty air con smell.  Further the air con vents blowed on my face while in bed until I turned off the air con and later, sweating woke up, with the room at about 30 degrees.  There was not a comfortable middle ground for sleeping with the temperature, considering the position of the vents.   The staff was friendly. The location near Emporium and the park is really convenient.   However Soi 22 is seedy. It is not a location I suggest for kids or a romantic partner.   This hotel has its place in the Bangkok mix, but I doubt I will stay here again. ",3,-0.103
"Like most other reputable hotels in Asia, the Marriott Queens Park did not disappoint - room was huge, helpful and friendly staff (typical Thai hospitality) and a great buffet breakfast spread where I wanted to try everything but ran out of time! Location was great where there are convenience stores, pubs and restaurants. Despite the hustle &amp; bustle outside, I couldn't hear any noise from my room.  Tip: If you are a Marriott Bonvoy member, check in via the normal check-in counters as there are more counters open and are much faster.",5,0.9384
boss is very nice guy.  so many rewards he give me a good take care. ボスは間違いなくタイで1番のスタッフです。 だから、もう一度このホテルに泊まりたいです。 おもてなしが最も素晴らしかったです。 特に、部屋の清掃が行き届いていました。 朝食も非常に美味しかったです。 バンコクで一番のホテルだと思います。 だから、私は友達に間違いないホテルだと進めます。,5,0.9113

"This hotel, in a word, is resplendent. It has a beautiful, large lobby, neat and modern rooms with all the usual amenities, and friendly staff. Location wise, it's close to most of the tourist attractions and malls in Bangkok. We visited in December and were lucky to witness the Christmas tree lighting ceremony, with Santa and his elves and little kids performing Christmas carols - it was wonderful. Here's what I particularly enjoyed: - The breakfast buffet spread is so vast and with so much variety you'll need 20 mins to just navigate it and take your pick. Don't miss the freshly made and Goji berry smoothie and the hotel's signature fluffy omelet. - If you have access to the members' lounge on the 27th floor, be sure to get there on time and enjoy the snacks at the live",4,0.985
"Being one of the first families to stay at this property when they first opened in 2016, we were reluctant to return this year due to retirement of the founding GM, Khun Bob. But to our delight, things have not changed and in fact our stay was a wonderful one. Booked 2 rooms for 2 nights to accommodate the 4 of us (2 adults &amp; our 2 children). Received a prompt email prior to arrival from the hotel manager (Khun David) informing us of an upgrade to King M-Suite with an attached double due to our membership in the Marriott loyalty program.   Upon arrival, we were escorted to the 27th floor M-Club lounge for member-guest reception with cold towels and refreshing lemongrass beverages. Our assigned suite and room were elegant, well appointed, and full of light overlooking the 9th",5,0.936
"Honestly everything you could ask for in a hotel stay.  The service was excellent during our entire stay.  From check in through check out, every person we encountered was nice, helpful, and on top of their game.  The rooms were spacious and nice!  We visited multiple restaurants on site and they all were great.  The breakfast buffet daily was amazing and had something from everyone.  One day all I wanted was coffee and the staff allowed me to grab a cup without charging me for the full breakfast.  That is service right there.  I would definitely choose this Marriott property on my next stay to Bangkok!",5,0.98
