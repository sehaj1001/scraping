"So I stayed at this hotel in March, the 5th through the 8th before I flew to Phuket to stay there a few days.  I have stayed at a few W hotels before but this one was one of the nicer ones.  I went to Thailand to celebrate my birthday and what they did for me and my room was awesome.  They had placed balloons all over my room, with a birthday card, 2 beers, and two cupcakes.  The hotel was very beautiful, the pool and spa were amazing and the gym was cool in which I wanted to get some workouts in but I did not get to use it because I was so busy with tours.  I would recommend this hotel to all my family and friends and I would stay here again.  The only thing I'm not too thrilled about is the amount of time it takes to receive a refund on an extra room I had prepaid for.  I am",5,0.9889
"The WoW experience started right at the check-in. Not only had W upgrades our family to an awesome room, the ‚Äúroom stylists‚Äù have made tremendous effort to decorate it with balloons for my daughter‚Äôs birthday.   So a special thank you to Khun Boo, the hotel manager whom has spare no effort to make our stay a delightful one. And not forgetting all the friendly staffs at front desk and   I won‚Äôt hesitate to take my family back to the W and definitely look forward to my next stay soon. Khor Khun Krup W!!! üôè",5,0.968

"We have just recently stayed at W bangkok for a night for my birthday treat and we were spoiled :)‚Äã from check in to check out. All staff made sure we had a pleasant stay.  To name a few, Nicole, who sent us a pre arrival email to make ensure a memorable stay, staffs on the other end of Marriott App who always response promptly to my request on Chat. (This is one thing I love about this app and if you dont have one you shouls download it!! )‚Äã, pool staffs and A lady at Woo Bar who surprised us with 2 special shots on the house....    We also made use of sauna and steam room at the spa which is complimentary for inhouse guest.   Location is good, within few steps you can find a BTS Station, 7-11, restaurants and bars.

"I stayed at the W Bangkok for over 100 days in a period of 14 months.   Service The staff and quality of the service at the W were the best of all the hotels I've stayed at in Bangkok (vs. Meridien, Marriot Surawongse, Marriot Sukhumvit, non-marriot, hotel, hostel) etc.   -24/7 super attentive and polite hotline for any needs (medicine/doctor, room service, admin, sending/receiving parcels) -non invasive, staff respect privacy -Best attitude I've seen from staff in Asia -Does an amazing brunch twice a month -During busy periods (e.g. Songkran) staff had great recommendations and were extremely accomodating  Room - High attention to detail in daily room cleaning and tidy up, regularly wow'ed at the amount of effort put into the 'room styling' - Stayed in entry level, upgraded and",5,0.9758
"This is the second time for me and my fiancee choose the W Bangkok.  All the staff here are helpful and lovely.  The assist manager Boo emailed me two days before we checked in, and I told him about the purpose of this traveling is an engagement journey,  thus he gave us a huge surprise!! He upgrades the room to a suite and prepared a lot of ballon and Donald duck paper-cut, which is my fiancee's favorite Disney character. As well as a hand-written welcome card. We were really touched by Boo's careful.   The room here is absolutely great and fashion, every staff here is young and lifeful. I love the atmosphere in W, I believe every young people will love the atmosphere here. By the way, the pool party here is damn good, if you have time, you can join the pool party on the 1st",5,0.9922
"Spent 2 nights here - along with a work colleague - it had been 4 years since my last visit. Level of service was excellent, food in the restaurant was great and the rooms were as well.  Outstanding help from Boo on the front desk - took time on many occasions to chat and help and even walk me around to make sure I knew where things were.  A really good experience",5,0.9744
"I recently stayed at the W Bangkok for work for 2 nights, this was my second visit and it again was an amazing experience. The service we received on checking from NATTACHAI (BOO) was exceptional and his assistance at every opportunity made our stay great. Fantastic pool for an early morning swim and the breakfast is fantastic and ver relaxing atmosphere. All staff are very friendly and helpful at all times. Will be back again soon.",5,0.9811
"Great hospitality and vibe as always.   From reception, restaurant staff and housekeeping - service is excellent.   Thanks W Bangkok for a great relaxing time.   I always look forward to staying there and making my business trip enjoyable.",5,0.9678
"Spent 5 days at the W in February after a long trip in India. The luxury of a comfortable bed, fluffy pillows, clean high quality sheets and lovely bathroom was well appreciated. The staff was very attentive and solved any problems that came up.  Buffet breakfast was excellent with very good espresso on the table quickly. Location is fantastic, quick walk to Chong Nonsi BTS and the entire South Sathorn neighborhood.  A great place to relax in Bangkok",5,0.9853
Greatly enjoyed my birthday weekend stay at the W. The team were very welcoming and took recognition of my TE membership status and upgraded me to a beautiful corner suite. On arrival Boo and Jason at the front desk made sure I was checked in and well looked after. To my surprise my room was decked out with balloons and also birthday cupcakes too! Room was super comfortable with great views overlooking the city.   I spent Saturday afternoon at the hotel pool party - super fun and had a fun lively atmosphere. Highly recommended.   Great times had and I will be back for sure!    ,5,0.9945
"Currently staying at the W Hotel and have to say we are having a great stay. Suites are worth the extra money. Outstanding service by Kate in Guest Relations. Choey from Concierge could not have been more helpful and Golf in the bar was lovely and went out of her way to make us welcome. Rooms are immaculate, clean and well maintained. Atmosphere is trendy, very friendly and we will certainly come back.",5,0.9828
Stayed just a night here and have nothing to criticize. Check-in was a breeze and front desk was very welcoming. Although the hotel design is not my style the room is very roomy and have great amenities. The bed in one of the most comfortable in hotels I‚Äôve stayed in. Lighting and air con control from small tablet. Didn‚Äôt have a chance to try their F&amp;B outlets as there are many good restaurants and cafes within walking distance. ,5,0.9514
"There are many positive reviews that this won't make a dent. However, I will make it short and manageable to digest.   Is the service the real deal? Absolutely. Anchelee emailed me prior to my stay to ensure my questions were answered and requests fulfilled. Never happened before. Kate, the guest relations specialist provided unmatched time and service.   Choose the Studio Suite. If it is $50 more a night, it's the best money you will spend in Bangkok. Though so far my review is full of superlatives, it is genuine. The size upgrade alone is tremendous. This cannot be overstated. You also get tangible perks that are worth more than the extra money spent.   The room is amazing. Look at the photos. I tried to take pictures that provide an accurate depiction of the room that others",5,0.9485
Low floors are close to the pool and noisy because of the pool parties. Ask for high floor. Breakfast is an assorted spread and a great start to the day. Complimentary valet parking was appreciated. One Issue I had was that the  3000 baht charge the hotel blocks upon check-in was not released for over a month on my credit card. Staff helpful to resolve situation. ,4,0.946
"Had an amazing stay at this beautiful and funky hotel! Prior to even arriving at the hotel, the communication from the team was first class. Location is great as walking distance to many points such as Lumphini pack, Siam 4 and the roof top bar at the Banyan Tree.  Food here was really great, so much variety and very accomodating to any dietary requirements too.  The room was clean with a very comfy bed and lovely design. I will definitely be returning to this hotel for a future Thailand trip!    Would like to mention Boom and Kate in the reservations team who really made the stay that extra bit special and added the personal touch to our stay ‚ò∫Ô∏è  Highly recommend this hotel for location, staff and food.",5,0.988
"One of the best W hotels. Check-in was a bit of a problem but I was provided a temporary room while they prepare the actual room.  Nice rooms, good food, cool people! Look for Mr Boo, he knows the best food place in and around the hotel.",5,0.9604
"This hotel has the best service. The staff go out of their way to make you feel special and take care of you the best they can. I was not feeling well, and when I requested lemon and honey for tea, they also sent up a get well card from the staff. How sweet!  The decor is a bit loud for me, but it‚Äôs a nice change for our weeklong stay.   Don‚Äôt forget to visit the old house for dinner or a drink. Fantastic venue.   Special welcome for Bonvoy members.",5,0.9727
"Great hotel with a modern hip vibe! The hotel rooms make you feel like you're in Vegas and everything about the hotel is fun and clean. I never knew a hotel like this exists outside of Las Vegas! Everything was plush, well decorated, and everything just felt had volume to it.  The breakfast was great and the lobby bar was quite a social spot at all times of the day. The property is very navigable and I never had problems with drivers or taxis finding the accommodation.   I definitely recommend this hotel to those looking for young hip, but luxurious stay!",5,0.9361
"Stayed at W Bangkok in Feb 2020. Titanium status.  Plus: Property is well designed, very true W, rooms are of good size, well appointed, good breakfast.  Minus: Little recognition of Titanium status. No upgrade - which was quite a surprise, No lounge (I know W doesn't have across - and most times just this factor makes me choose other Marriott brands over W), Small swimming pool.",3,0.8775
"We are Gold Elite in the Marriott Bonvoy scheme.  Stayed here for 2 nights using reward points.  We were upgraded at check-in and given floor 11 ( next time I would request a much higher floor as there are 29). We also received a welcome gift of free drinks at one of the property bars.  The room was large and had an amazing bed, we slept very well. Could not fault the room that was modern and clean. The staff were very polite and helpful.  We did not eat at the property as we had engagements with friends but we did pop out to the 711 just next door to get extra water and snacks. We used the on site gym that was spacious, clean and with good cardio equipment.  Great property, wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to recommend it to friends and family. The only caveat for us was that the Sathorn area",5,0.9874
"I didn't actually stay here buyut because the Gymnasium was closed after an emergency in my nearby sister Hotel ; I was transported here to enjoy their gymnasium facilities. I was really impressed both with the said facilities located on a lower floor adjacent to the Pool and also buy the welcoming attitude of the W's staff. The Hotel itself looked wonderful, very sleek and stylish. It was sad to have to leave it; although, of course, my actual Hotel; the Le Meridien was superb!",5,0.8881
"We booked 5 nights and had a fantastic stay largely due to the excellent service provided by Nattachai (Boo) the W‚Äôs Assistant Manager who made reservations for us at PAII at The House and Charm. He also provided us some great insider information to a Gin distillery called Iron Balls.  Stay here and book the studio room, it‚Äôs got an amazing bathtub overlooking the city...",5,0.9578
"I am a frequent business traveller and stay at W Bangkok every week. The staff at W are amazing - from the front desk, concierge, receptionist to the staff at TKT serving breakfast. Every interaction with a W staff has been filled with warmth, friendliness and sincerity, which makes the stay very pleasant. Appreciate it when the W staff remembers my preferences and welcomes me at every stay. Special thanks to Boo, the duty manager, for his warm hospitality at every stay!",5,0.9773
"This is my second visit here. It is such a superb experience staying and having great time at this hotel, especially recreation facilities. Staff at fitness and swimming pool took very good care of me and my parent. Special thanks to Khun Doe who had rendered his service with sincerity, willingness and full service minded. He trained me Thai boxing class which I deeply appreciate and enjoy so much. What he had performed for us is beyond our needs/expectation. He had also given us worthy exercise advices of how to keep up with good health and well being. Also, thanks Khun Momo for his helpfulness and service. Look forward to staying at this hotel soon.",5,0.9918
"Location is very good  Check in experience was very fast and professional  Room is very specious and well equiped Dining experience is very good but needs to have more international choices Staff is very helpful and willing to help taking care of small details, as a personal experience I made a comment and surprised they responded very quick to  my comment I will make it my first choice in my next visit to Bangkok",5,0.9596
"One sentence to describe W Bangkok Hotel- ‚ÄúJust an Awesome W Team‚Äù! Been a frequent visitor to W Bangkok for both business and pleasure for the past 7years  and the W team always goes above and beyond expectations. From the moment you check in, the team greets you with pretty friendly smile, not just your standard hotel welcoming. You literally feel welcomed from the bottom of their heart of Thai hospitality.  During your stay, the team always checks on your stay and provides additional services from helping with restaurant bookings and additional amenities in your room to make you stay more comfortable. For example, during my recent stay the W stylist Pang gave additional waters to keep myself hydrated from the heaty weather in Bangkok and also from my past history of ordering",5,0.9817
"Stayed over New Year's period. The hotel was fully booked, so wrote to me in advance apologising for not being able to provide an upgrade to me despite my Platinum status. That was a really nice transparent gesture, and I could completely understand how in this situation an upgrade is impossible. Everything about the hotel was lovely and comfortable. Wonderful staff and high service levels. Excellent, comfortable room with very good bedding, effective air-con, and other amenities. Large tasty breakfast buffet and restaurant. Also the bar / restaurant in the old house was very pleasant and I loved the design. Large gym and pleasant pool area.",5,0.9906
"Coming again to Bangkok, we chose the W hotel, Studio room.  Today I know it was the best possible choice.  The hotel compared to other 5 star hotels we have stayed in Bangkok deserves 6 stars.  Everything is right at this hotel.  The service level, reception, bar, restaurant, pool and room itself are ideal.  We asked for early check-in which was no problem.  Room clean, cleaned thoroughly every day.  A delicious breakfast where everyone will find something for themselves, a huge selection, and very professional service.  Drinks on the bar and service there also very very professional.  It was a great pleasure to spend 3 days there, I myself work in the hospitality in a 5 * hotel and I often see different things, but there was nothing to attach to.  In Bangkok, I will never look",5,0.8815
"First impressions can be bad, but the last impression is exactly that. The lasting one.   Had a bit of an issue at Check In, w room etc....cue Khun Boo, Assistant Manager.   He recognized the issue and came to the rescue. He found me the right room for the 4 days. He followed up several times during the week and offered to take care of anything I needed. His personal touch really mattered, I am a W Fan for Life.   Thanks Boo.",5,0.9552
"Stayed at the W Bangkok for four nights (Jan 19-23). Service was very good, location - proximity to skytrain - was useful for exploring other parts of the city. Gym was adequate. It had everything we needed. Also, a high point was the complimentary birthday cupcakes they sent up to the room. I didn‚Äôt actually mention it was my birthday - they likely figured that out from my Marriott Bonvoy Gold Status. It was a nice touch to an already pleasant visit. Whatever Whenever concierge service was also very helpful arranging a message at a local place about two blocks away.",5,0.953
"My fiance and I decided to have a joint bachelor/bachelorette party in Thailand and ended up having 27 people make it.  While in Bangkok, I saw an ad for the Beats by The Pool party and thought it would be a great event for our group.  We love hip-hop and most of the venues we had been to did not play hip hop.  To our surprise, this pool party provided the music we love and an experience we will never forget.  With only 1 day notice, Val hooked up a VIP section for all of our guests.  Not only that, but she baked us a cake, half groom, half bride!  It was truly an amazing experience from the music, to the dancing, to the accommodations by the hotel.  If you love hip hop or just want to have a blast, I highly recommend the Beats By The Pool event!  I will definitely be back! ",5,0.9903
I wanted to say lots of thanks for all of the hotel staffs and their services during my stay. All hotel staffs especially bell teams were extremely kind and nice work for special assistance to me. Could not find any words for their continuous supports and enabled my stay safe and comfortable ever. Swear I will be back here for my next trip to BK with my biggest appreciation.,5,0.9725
"In Bangkok we have a  lot of choice of hotel but the W is definitely the place to be just for the hotel experience. I was perfectly amazed by the quality of the room, the creative design and especially about the comfort and the great atmosphere of the bathroom. Be sure to have your best clothes to be in line with the standing of the hotel and the other clients !",5,0.9905
"My 3rd stay at W Bangkok. The level of service here is simply top notch. This is one hotel that I‚Äôve never seen any staff without a smile in all my stays with them so far, and they are just so polite! Our young daughter got a complimentary soft toy with a personalized card and she was so excited with her new toy that she went ‚Äúuncle gives baa baa sheep‚Äù.. We drank plenty of water and our room stylist, Dome, was so attentive to our needs that he gave us more bottles and a note. Such personal touch really influences my 1st choice of hotel whenever I go BKK. Well done, W team!",5,0.8121
"I had heard so much about ‚ÄúW‚Äù hotels before I stayed in this one!!! What a let down! I can only comment on the room size &amp; garish interiors... will refrain on commenting on Restaurants as we did not try one after our ‚Äúbreakfast experience‚Äù!!! So what if it was a busy day, ain‚Äôt the staff equipped to handle a full house! They were scattered all over... getting wrong orders, taking forever to make it right. It was absolutely ridiculous, if not laughable! Avoidable, guys! ",3,-0.8025
"We were greeted by the lady supervisor named Boom when we checked-in.  Although the hotel is very busy on New Years Eve, she was very courteous and very professional, and gave us all the information we needed.  We saw her a couple of times during our short stay, and she always reached out to us.  We ended up having drinks/food on the first floor, ordering room service, did our spa at the hotel, ate breakfast, and then ate at the House on Sathorn the next day, basically almost not leaving the hotel at all.  We met a lady named Mild when we checked-out who was also very nice.  Unlike the staff at some W hotels elsewhere who pay only lip service, the W at Bangkok really provided excellent service all around.",5,0.9147
"From the moment you stepped out of the taxi, to check-in, get into the elevator, move to your room, go to the lounge bar, have breakfast, seek help from the concierge...everywhere I saw the staff members, they smiled.  The service at W BKK was simply amazing, one of the best I have ever seen.  The front desk manager Mr. Kong certainly made me feel like a valued Marriott Elite member, very patient to answer my questions and trying his best to accommodate my request.  I had a wonderful experience, as always. ",5,0.9833
"Really enjoyed staying at the W. It‚Äôs quirky and fun but a little noisy. Good location, close to Chong Nonsi Skytrain and easy to get to the river for boat rides. Lovely room, bed and bathtub. A few improvements I would suggest: make the shower stronger, move the armchair as it takes up space in the middle of the room, and put drinks and snacks away as they are gathering dust which the cleaners have not dealt with. The gym is good and has free refreshing drinks - much appreciated. The pool is close to an outdoor venue which blasts horrible music so it‚Äôs not relaxing to lie by the poolside. The lifts are dark and claustrophobic. However, the cons are not major and I would stay here again. ",4,0.9795
"This is my second stay at W Bangkok. The first was in November 2018. Back then I was already impressed by the service when a guest relation officer (a Taiwanese gentleman who has since left W Bangkok) noticed that I was feeling unwell from swollen salivary glands, arranged to send a bowl of rice congee with compliments, to my room to help ease my hunger as I wasn't able to eat solid food.  A year later, I am back as a newly minted Marriot Bonvoy Platinum member, and the surprise congratulatory decoration in my room and note prepared by Khun Chai of the guest service team, made the return visit so much more welcoming.  What impressed me even more was the forward planning the team made to arrange for use of the swimming pool at Le Meridien Bangkok, when guests like myself who",5,0.9689
What a great experience we had at the W. Highly recommend this place! The people and staff were very accommodating and helpful. Very friendly. It makes dealing with a long travel time that much more relaxing when you reach your destination.,5,0.9541
"This is supposed to be a recharged trip for the new year , and boy was I well taken care of by the W team in bangkok. I have made many requests/ enquiries before my actual trip and every request met way exceeded my expectations. One example that I really have to mentioned.. I engaged a muay thai instructor to come to W to give me a private lesson. The gym wasn't exactly conducive enough to hold the session and I voiced out this issue to their Director of Rooms , Jason. He suggested clearing out one of the function rooms for me to hold my MT session and when I arrived in bankok , he personally ensured that the function room was ready. I was extremely impressed with the level of service and initiative shown by Jason and he was one of the guys who made sure that my stay there was",5,0.9348
"We had a studio svit and everything was perfect. The room cleaning is done flawless and the room stylist has been observering that we was drinking a lot of water and put more bottle for us and encouring us to keep doing so for our health.  We arrived with great welcoming surprise because it was our honeymoon. The breakfast was fantastic. Many choices and different taste around the world, most Asia flavors.  They had a gym and it was clean and nice. it's just by the pool so very close to relax and have a chill during a hot afternoon.  Our honeymoon has been great so far with a great start at W bangkok. We are going back and stay a couple of days again on our trip back.  The location is good for us to find Grab, smililar to Uber and takes us anywhere easily. I would highly",5,0.9911
"We had a lovely stay the W hotel, our daughter loved the the glitz of the room and the shiny boxing gloves. The slight blemish on the trip was a the loud music that was coming in from an outdoor concert till 23:30 but having informed the staff the next day we they promptly moved us to two other rooms on the other side of the hotel.  The hotel is close to Chong Nonsi BTS station and is connected directly via Sathron Place so easy to get to and from the station as well having access to a 7Eleven and coffee shops. It is a little bit away from the attractions than we expected but getting to the malls, attractions was straight forward due to BTS and use of taxis.",5,0.9697
"I would highly recommend W bangkok to friends as hotel is close to BTS station, few stops to Siam and Chitlom. It's not crowded around that area. Attentive service and friendly staff. I appreciated their service especially Guest Service Manager ~ Ms. Boom who provided us great and wholeheartedly services and Front Office ~ Mr. Boo who is very pleasant. They made my trip an unforgettable and enjoyable one. ",5,0.9697
"Checked in on 28 Dec til 1 Jan, where we had booked the studio suite. It was peak period due to the New Year festivities. Despite the crowd, the hotel staff still maintained their cool and cheery demeanor, the concierge did a great job helping me and my partner with our last minute bookings, and the little acts of thoughtfulness by the room cleaning team left a delightful experience for us.   Thank you once again for making our stay so pleasant and stress free. Will definitely return to the W Bangkok.",5,0.984
"I really enjoyed my stay there, the hotel and the staff are really great. The breakfast is simply wonderful and there is absolutely nothing to miss. The only negativ thing is that the pool area is maybe a little bit small but there where never a lot of people so that was not an issue for me but I think it could get crowded at times. Would definetly come back again next time while I am in Bangkok.",5,0.7715
Service was excellent especially from Kyle at the reception. Spectacular room was spacious and bed was very comfortable. Nice pool area and gym open 24h. Good location close to BTS. Neighbours were smoking in the rooms despite non smoking policy. Hotel needs to address that! ,4,0.9269
"My wife and I stayed here for the first portion of our honeymoon and it was an amazing experience. From the moment we arrived until we left we were constantly impressed with the customer service and hotel amenities.   The hotel staff surprised us with balloons and champagne to kickoff our honeymoon. Each staff member we met or interacted with was incredibly kind and always looking to make sure we were comfortable. The pool, gym, and spa were all fantastic and the breakfast buffet had almost everything you could think of.   The hotel is in a good spot to catch the sky train and is well known to cab drivers.   The coconuts at the pool were fantastic!   Highly recommend! ",5,0.9871
"People often ask me which hotel in Bangkok I can recommend. For me there is a clear favourite. Every stay has been excellent so far. Everyone goes out of their comfort zone to make the difference to other hotels. In the end, the little things make the change and make you feel you've chosen the right hotel. During my stay in December 2019, it was important to me to relax and just let my mind wander. What better place to do this than in the hotel's WET area. Many thanks to the whole team, namely Toey, Momo, Wat, Golf and Samit for the great hospitality. It is always a pleasure to be able to forget everything around in this oasis in the middle of Bangkok. Looking forward to the next stay.",5,0.9792

"My stay is absolutely PERFECT.  Pre-arrival email sent by Boom, he takes care of me carefully. With pre-arrange the arrival limousine which made my late arrival more smooth. He also sent me recommendations and prepared welcome amenities with welcome notes.   Checked in by Ply is very efficiency. Thank you for the nice talk with nana during my stay.  I also want to say big thanks to the whatever/whenever team!! I have to border them many times during my stay. Ice, sally and the whole team, they help me booked spa treatments, made restaurant reservation and other minor stuff.

"We have stayed during the weekend, the hotel was busy as they had organized 2 functions in the evening on that day. Housekeeping did a great job! I was surprised at how clean the hotel was and they kept it tidy even they were really busy.   All staffs were so friendly and very accommodating.

"The best ever!  I stayed at W Bangkok for a few nights. From the arrival till the departure, it was all perfect. They have covered all the possible touch points amazingly and memorably. I cannot thank enough the whole team who has made my first visit to Bangkok so wonderful. Special mention to Nicole, Val, Vicky, Diego and Lynda (BnF trainee) who has taken care of me so well throughout my stay. From Style team, Wikanda May who was very caring and considerate in not only making up my room but also initiatively provided more bottles of water when i didn‚Äôt ask for it.

Small treats at every time of the day and in every corner of the hotel, handwritten notes, automatic adjustments of our needs in the room (more towels and water bottles), etc.   The room had a very modern decoration and had a stunning view. The bed was its highlight! The most comfortable bed we've ever slept in.  The breakfast was vast and very tasty and the Woobar is just amazing!

"I stayed in the W Bangkok for 4 nights for the conference. Jason Wei made a great arrangement for us. I want to personally Thank you him for the welcome surprises. The location of the hotel is within the walking to distance to the BTS so it made our travels hassle free.  The room is slightly smaller than expected, and the view was okay. Wish it was a higher floor tho.  A good spread of breakfast so I have nothing to complaint.  Overall, a good stay!",4,0.9768
"Great hotel! I had no issues with it. It is very modern, very stylish. Every time I went in, I could smell a great scent around the lobby. Staff was very polite and nice. My room was perfectly clean (every single day). Its size was huge! The bed was huge too, it could easily fit like 4-5 people. Also the bed was super comfortable; one of the most comfortable hotels‚Äô bed I have ever experienced! Bathroom was great! Large size, big bathtub, separate toilet and separate shower. The bathroom amenities were of high quality. Free bottles of water every day was a big plus. Wi-Fi was working very fast. I would totality stay at this hotel again if I come back to Bangkok.  The only one negative thing I can mention is the location of the hotel which could have been better. It wasn‚Äôt really",5,0.9929

"First time stayed in W Bangkok.  At first didn't realize it was so near to BTS.  Found out that its easier to access to various hot spots in Siam, phrom phrong, ASIATIQUE and iconsiam.  Room is so spacious and can hold 2 queen size beds.  Staff are very friendly and helpful.  Good variety in breakfast. Will definitely come again. ",5,0.932
"Our stay at the W was an absolute pleasure. It was a big occasion for us and we were greeted with lovely balloons and card in our room. As a Bonvey member we were treated to a room upgrade and a lovely view over Bangkok.  The staff in the W are truly professional, and ensured that we had a great stay. The room is fantastic and the bed extremely comfortable. The pool is big and plenty of beds to sunbathe.  Thanks for a fantastic stay",5,0.9873
"This was a visit that I did not expect to take. The hotel was wonderfully designed, and while they were all different (I previously stayed in W Bali Seminyak), they all had similar themes. And I am Glad to say that this was very well appreciated.  Perhaps what made my stay in W Bangkok (I stayed four nights) amazing was just how immaculate the service. From the reception team, to the housekeeping team, or what device crew at breakfast, every single one was just amazing, friendly and more importantly know what they could do to make your stay so much better. From providing more water in the room (glass bottles too, not plastic) when they noticed we were drinking up much faster, to me noticing a service crew passing a spoon to someone at breakfast, when he was trying to get one",5,0.9825
"The hotel proactively reached out via Email prior to my arrival to arrange for my stay which I consider was a very good gesture. I managed to secure a Marvelous suite and room was super cool and spacious. I love how I was able to control all the lightings with the tablet situated besides my bed. The room was also filled with plenty of bottled water which I appreciate. When I asked for additional tissue boxes, the house keeping staff provided more than I asked and placed them all over the suites, which I very much appreciate.  The breakfast options were also very good. There were plenty of selections from typical Thai cuisines to Asian course, to Western styles. The service throughout my stay was amazing too. Overall, I would recommend this property and I would definitely come",5,0.989
"Next to Chong Nonsi BTS and Mahanakhon Tower, the hotel is close to several famous restaurants such as LeDu, EatMe and Nahm.  It is a short walk or one BTS stop to Silom, or 3 BTS stops to Siam Paragon.  Thanks to Bonvoy Platinum I was upgraded from Wonderful to Studio junior suite, which looks directly at Mahanakhon Tower with its sky walk!  W Kitchen Table serves excellent Thai food better than some nearby local Thai restaurants.  As Bonvoy Platinum member one gets two drink vouchers which can be used at Woobar. There is no club lounge so breakfast is at main Kitchen Table.  Next door is Sathorn Square which has a Fitness First gym, if you are a passport member.  Stays recommended.",5,0.908
"The W Bangkok is super fun and trendy. The decor is contemporary with sparkling glam camp! The people working here are great especially the restaurant. We stayed in a Marvellous suite on the 30th floor (the hotel has 31 floors) and it was spectacular both in size as well and views and comfort. The only downside is that perhaps an express elevator for the upper floors would be nice as you can find yourself waiting or stopping at every other floor. Breakfast is a must, the W puts on a really great buffet service and the bars are another must. Try drunk Jenga! ",5,0.9665
"A new hotel to add to our favorite hotels in the world list. The W Bangkok is amazing in every way from the Car Service to and from the airport and everything in between. The Hotel is absolutely beautiful and one of the cleanest hotels we have ever stayed in.   Conveniently located within walking distance to the train station and much of the city, the service, amenities, and food were all on point. Breakfast was terrific every morning, we had an amazing and romantic dinner at The Sathorn House, the lobby bar was a great way to close out the afternoon, and the pool was very relaxing.    If we could suggest any area for improvement, we would have to say the night concierge was not all that helpful but overall, W Bangkok is near the top of our list of favorite hotels.",5,0.9669
W Bangkok has WoWed me. It was definitely one of the best stay that I have had.   I am 100% sure whenever I came to Bangkok I will be staying at W only.  Sundee at the reception was amazing. Never seen such hospitality in any 5 star hotel.  Thanks,5,0.9612

The hotel immediately accommodated my request and even sent a basket of fruits for my inconvenience.  The rest of my stay was very pleasant. I should warn travelers who are particular about noise about the noise the train makes curving around the rails, however, on the side of the hotel that faces it. There is no noise on the other side.  I urge the management to put double windows to ward off sound as you are a 5 star hotel, just like Singaporean hotels do.",4,0.255

"Our room, amenities, and food/bev were all great at the W, but what really stands out was the service rendered by their staff. To my everlasting embarrassment, I put the Concierge staff to the ultimate test by leaving my Mac book on the plane from Taipei. I was beside myself when I realized I'd left the computer in the seat-back pocket but the staff were right  on the job. They coordinated with the airline and the W representatives at the airport.

Rooms are comfortable, largely spacious and well decked out with amenities. There is a  shower head, rain shower and a bath in the bath-toilet. We had a twin room, and we were pleasant surprised by the twin double beds, plus 4 luxurious feather pillows. All in all, an excellent touch.

I have been to Bangkok many times and stayed on many of the Marriot properties but i must say W Hotel offers me the most wonderful experience.

Everything was great from check-in to our requests to checking out, it is just that efficient and they fail to help you with the requests.   The experience was already very positive from the moment i booked the hotel.

There is a glamous villa within the property site. EZ to find the location - You walk 200 meters from the BTS station and the hotel stands just right next to the MahaNakhon skycrapper.   The front desk staff immediately found my booking and recogonized my platium elite membership status. I was offered complimentary breakfast and two free drink couponsÔºàone per nightÔºâ.    I like the bar in ground floor which makes it convenient for guest to get a drink while waiting. The service of the bar and breakfast restaurant was very good.   HoweverÔºåthe size of the pool is relatively small compared to other W hotels I have been to. The view by the pool is blocked by walls or other building.

"For some reason the W Hotels are among one of the worst in terms of handing room upgrades to elite tier members and W Bangkok is no different.  For this reason, I try to avoid this brand usually but wanted to try the one in Bangkok because some of my friends were staying here as well.  The W Bangkok could perhaps learn one or two things from the St Regis brand especially the one in Bangkok which is exemplary in service.

"My only negative comment on the W is with all the pre check-in communication and offers of assistance our only request was an early check in, that was ignored and on arrival at 10am having been in the air for 16hrs. we were told checkin was 3pm. I get it, hotels do it all over the world, but surely the checkin-checkout model can be evolved to cater for people arriving and leaving at different hours? (We did get in before 3)  Other than that we loved it. Big rooms, great food, great drinks, super friendly staff, not so sure about no privacy on the toilet though. Overall good value for money, would stay there again.",5,0.9857
"Five star luxury all around, but the W is also quite weird.  Now let's start with the smell. As soon as you walk in you are hit with the strong distinctive floral smell, shiny merchandise and club music. There are mirrors everywhere.  The rooms are very large but impersonal. Nice ample bathtubs, but the toilets have mirrors everywhere. it's odd. You watch yourself having showers and also yourself sitting on the toilet.  Extremely comfortable bed but saggy horrible pillows.   This is a perfect business hotel for clients who are aged 45 and up. It screams luxury and mid life crisis. Definitely not for the younger tourist.   Food is okay. Staff are excellent staff extremely helpful and honestly some of the best service I've had anywhere",4,0.9761

Really disappointed that the hotel has pull out this service and was told to call them on the day to ask for transport. What if they can't get any transport which will delay my trip to the airport to catch my flight.
