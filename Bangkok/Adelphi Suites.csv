"We recommend Adelphi Suites based on location and service.  The hotel is located about a 5-minute walk from the Nana Skytrain station that connects to the Suvarnabhumi airport and about a 15-minute walk from the Sukhumvit MRT blue line (underground train).  It’s about one half a block down from the busy Sukhumvit Road, but the hotel is quite quiet.  Rooms are spacious and our room had a washer drier unit which was convenient.  Sang, one of the hotel lobby managers, helped arrange a driver for us for a one-day excursion to Ayutthaya.  Our driver, Yai, was terrific and we highly recommend him for day trips and excursions.  He can be reached directly at these numbers: +66982756434 or +66830249870.    The Adelphi is located very close to some great restaurants: Kinnaree that is",5,0.9393
"Just completed a 14 night stay here which, as usual, was very enjoyable. When looking for a hotel, we take a number of factors into account. ROOMS - ours was spacious, clean and comfortable. LOCATION - excellent. There are countless bars and restaurants to cater for all tastes and pockets just minutes away. (Incidentally, one of the best is the Hotel's own restaurant - Monsoon- which offers a wide selection of good food and drinks at reasonable prices). And a Skytrain station - Nana - at the end of the road. STAFF - all are polite, efficient and very friendly. They illustrate why Thailand is known as the Land of Smiles.  We have already booked further stays in January and February, which shows how much we like this place.",5,0.9851
"Feels more like an apartment rather than a hotel. Great facilities and the service is incredible. Great location as well. Right in the middle of everything, but also off to the side so it’s not too loud. Overall, amazing place and I look forward to staying there again!",5,0.9192
"We loved how central this hotel was to everything in we needed to get to in Bangkok. It was very close to coffee shops, good restaurants, the BTS, shopping malls, and of course taxis and tuk tuks galore. We enjoyed being able to walk to were we needed to go and got taxi’s to every where else we wanted to visit such as the temples and the riverside. Would recommend this hotel because it felt safe even though it was in the red light district. They supplied everything from laundry detergent, to toiletries, to kitchen supplies which we never used. We loved how we were able to use the washing machine whenever we needed too which was every day in humid and sweaty Bangkok. The laundry machine was one main reason why I booked this hotel. When you book 4 nights through the hotel itself",5,0.9607
"This hotel has is all.. * amazing location * amazing rooms * a great staff * a good restaurant * a fantastic breakfast  We just loved our 6 day stay in this hotel, And we will be staying here again on our next visit to Bangkok!!!  Also a big thanks and shout out to ""cream"" for the super service!!!",5,0.9849
"Location is just perfect if you are for a few days in Bangkok. Had the upgrade for the Premier Suite, which was really big. But all rooms are have a good size and all the necessary equipment you might need - e.g. hot water cooker, fridge, table&amp;chair, comfortable bed and many other things. You have a nice pool with great view and a good equipped gym (with AC). The people working in the hotel were friendly, the daily cleaning service was exceptional. In the floor there is a very good restaurant Monsoon, which have also high level non-thai food choices. And you could order it as a room-service. For sure the Adelphi Suites will be my hotel, when I am in Bangkok again. You can't do anything wrong with that choice.",5,0.9829
Clean neat apt. Washer/dryer but bring pant and clothes hangers for items that can’t be tumbled dried. Close to all Sukhumvit has to offer plus only 50m to Nana BTS. Monsoon Restaurant good with a varied menu. Good breakfast. Definitely would stay here again. Staff are very courteous friendly and obliging.,4,0.9769
"Great place. Its right off sukhumvit and the nana stop is right there. The little street itself is lively and has some nice restaurants. Go out to sukhumvit and turn left and you will get to artbox, an open area with shops and good food. Very enjoyable",5,0.9286
"We booked a studio apartment which was spotless and had all the imenities you could ask for. Check in staff friendly and the location is on a side street just of sukhumvit road, close to nana Bts Station. Bell boy got us a meter taxi back to bkk. ",5,0.4939
"I traveled with my mom to BKK and found this hotel situated at a great location. It is adjacent to the BTS in a few mins walk and in a walkable distance to MRT. The staff are warm and friendly, very willing to help and answer to our requests. Room is clean and great breakfast choices. The suite at 16/f even has a washing machine which is so unexpected! ",4,0.9599
"Our suite was very comfortable and extremely spacious. It was furnished with everything required for our 3 night stay, the only item we had to request was a drying rack. The Monsoon restaurant offers a very good menu at reasonable prices and is extremely popular. Although we didn't use it the pool looked very welcoming. Location wise it is ideal if you enjoy this area of the city, good transport links and an excellent choice of bars and eateries.",5,0.9833
"I would rate this hotel an all 5 star rating. Clean, very attractive rooms, excellent staff and service. The hotel restaurant ”Monsoon” have something on the menu for every one. On my next BKK trip l will book this hotel again!",5,0.8793
"Nice rooms, great location, good amenities - overall we had a good stay at Adelphi. The reception staff was helpful, lots of options around. The breakfast probably could have been better, and was slightly cramped with not enough indoor seating space! If i leave that aside, overall had a good stay.",4,0.9656
"Definitely a very good place to stay in Bangkok. Great location in quiet street off main road but handy to BTS, shopping and eating establishments.  Room was clean and tidy and spacious,  well equipped with comfortable bed. Staff at Adelphi always friendly and helpful.  Breakfast at Monsoon was okay, same type of food each day but tasty and fresh. Overall a pleasant stay and would certainly stay there again. ",4,0.9891
The hotel have a good staff and good location near Nana BTs and every things around seven 11 and other massage. The room is good also clean and very good furnished. Break fast is nice also. In general I advice to stay at this hotel. ,4,0.9442
"Stayed there a few times. Well maintained hotel with a pool and well equipped fitness centre. Stayed in a Studio room that is very large room with a small living room, a small kitchen with hot plate heater, microwave, large fridge, plates, cutlery.  Staff are friendly. 1 slight issue: Rooms are clean but wish the Housekeeping staff paid also attention to some areas like walls : noticed few stains around the bedhead that were never cleaned.  The hotel location is excellent, 2 min walk from Nana BTS station. 15 mins ride to Phaya Thai BTS station to get the train to airport. 10 min to Asoke BTS station (Terminal 21 mall) and Sukhumvit MRT station (from there to ride to Chatuchak week-end market). 5 min bts ride to Siam BTS Center (Siam Paragon mall), add a couple of mins more to",4,0.9549
"My girlfriend and I really enjoyed our time here. The suite was well equipped, extremely comfortable, peaceful and quiet despite the nearby bustle of Bangkok.  The situation gives easy access on foot to the main thoroughfare of Sukhumvit.  But most of all, I must commend the hotel staff for their attentiveness and professionalism, they take very good care of the visitors.  Thank you for your welcome.  ",5,0.983
"I love staying at the Adelphi Suites. The staff are very professional, friendly and helpful and will go out of their way to help solve the little problems that can occur while away for home on holidays. They are also very helpful in assisting in organising day trips. The suites are excellent, comfortable and clean and maintained by excellent housekeeping staff. The food and drinks at the Monsoon restaurant are of great variety and top class. The restaurant and bar staff are also very professional and helpful. I highly recommend Adelphi Suites for family  or business stays in Bangkok. I should add it is a great location near Sukhumvit precinct and a few minutes walk from the BTS which can connect you to the entire Bangkok public transport system,",5,0.9927
"Best hotel ever! Friendly staff,nice view room  with heartfelt service !We arrived hotel at 1200,reception Joy checked me in with a warm welcome. We got the room with really nice view and cozy room. Very clean. All staff were well trained including bell service. Very convenient and close BTS nana station. We had a great time in Bangkok. Must come back this hotel again ! Although my husband missing his glasses but reception Trainee tried to help us. Sorry I forgot her name but she is great. Unfortunately we haven't tried the bar at G/floor. Seems really cool! Sarah  有史以來最好的酒店！ 友好的工作人員，風景優美的客房，提供真誠的服務！我們於1200年抵達酒店，接待處Joy熱情地歡迎我入住。 我們的房間風景非常好，舒適的房間。 很乾淨。 所有員工都接受過包括貝爾服務在內的培訓。 非常方便，離BTS娜娜車站很近。 我們在曼谷度過了愉快的時光。 必須再次回到這家酒店！ 儘管我的丈夫沒有戴眼鏡，但是接待實習生試圖幫助我們。 對不起，我忘了她的名字，但是她很棒。 不幸的是，我們還沒有嘗試過G /",5,0.9789

"Was traveling through Bangkok several times in Nov/Dec 2019 and needed a room for 1 or 2 nights on 3 separate occasions. The hotel I normally stay at inexplicably	decided to double their usual rates so I thought I’d try a new place. The ratings for Adelphi Suites were very high and I decided to give it a chance. I received a complimentary upgrade on the first visit, which was very nice and really enjoyed the bigger room. On the next 2 stays I received the room I booked which was also quite large with a small kitchen and separate sitting area. Overall I really like this hotel as the rooms are large, beds are comfortable, everything is well maintained and the staff is quite nice. My only complaint was with the in room WiFi which was frankly terrible. Constantly getting the dreaded",4,0.9165
"Hotel is at very convenient location , staff is very courteous and rooms are good . Menu in restaurant is also good and reasonably priced.Many attractions including Nana square are within walking distance plus Metro station is also round the corner.",5,0.9041
"My partner and I stayed in an one bedroom apartment which overlooked the city. It was such a clean and tidy room in a great location, so worth the money.The staff were very friendly and helpful and made us feel welcomed. Our room also was cleaned thoroughly everyday which was so helpful. Will definitely stay here again 😊",5,0.9715
Apartment situated near Nana BTS station and convenient to travel around Bangkok shopping area. Staff very friendly and helpful. Many restaurants and massage shops around the area. Rooms are clean but the air-condition system is noise. The noise comes from the air circulation duct which can be improved.  ,4,0.8511
As isual we have enjoyed our home away from home.  We have brought some friends to stay at Adelphi suites and they love it as much as us . Adelphi suites is in a great  position and has a wonderful  restaurant.  The stagf at the restaurant and hotel are accommodating warm and friendly I would recommend this hotel in a heartbeat though i do think that the rooms may be over priced ,5,0.9776
I've stayed here for three times already within this year and will keep coming back. The hotel room is clean/spacious and the hotel staff members are very friendly and welcoming. The location is unbeatable as it is only a minute away from Nana BTS and that exit/extrance of Nana BTS has both an elavator and escalator (this is a plus for my mother who has knee problems and cannot go up/down the stairs easily).,5,0.6068
"This was my first time in Adelphi Suites hotel. Excellent location only 1 minuets to Nana BTS station. There are several bars restaurants in soi 8. About room I have to say size is perfect, beautiful  bedroom, living room, bathroom.  Very quiet very clean.Comfortable bed. There is a pool and gym on rooftop. Very well maintained. The elevators are key-card operated which adds a level of security. Staff very friendly and helpful especially Nannii. Cleaning staff also friendly and polite. Restaurant Monsoon provides about delicious different and get ood quality food.  All in one, highly recommend! ",5,0.986
"I love this hotel. Have been there 3 times now, and it's great value for money. The rooms are big and clean and nice and the staff is super kind. And the hotel is at Soi 8, which is one of my favorite streets of Sukhumvit - cosy and lively street with street food, massages and restaurants and close to everything else, you might need. Highly recommend.",5,0.9851
" i chose this hotel for its proximity to the BTS, shopping centres and entertainment. it exceeded my expectations for convenience, just steps away from the main street SUKHUMVIT ROAD but quiet enough.they offered an upgrade to a 1 br suite for only a nominal amount and the added washer and dryer was greatly appreciated, eliminating any laundry costs. the suite was very comfortable and spacious. the hotel service was exceptional, prompt and very friendly. i will definitely seek to book here again. dining at the adjoining restaurant was convenient and friendly, i would regard the food pricing as moderately high and the quality and presentation as satisfactory.",5,0.9839
"In short: This property was wonderful for us. We would recommend and return.   In detail:  LOCATION The hotel is located a few minute walk from Sukhumvit road and the Nana BTS. There is a walking bridge nearby as well if you do not want to brave crossing the street to the more active side of Sukhumvit at night. The hotel itself is on Soi 8 which is quieter due to it having a dead end. The street does have several restaurant bars and hotels so by no means is it desolate.    SERVICE Front desk, bellhop, parking attendant, breakfast staff, and maid service were all warm, welcoming, and helpful.  ROOM Wow! We stayed in the one bedroom premier and it was perfect. It was a spacious one bedroom apartment with clean lines and a contemporary design. The bed was the most comfortable. We",5,0.969
"great place to stay. we were there 7  nights. 200 metres from skytrain just off main road but right in the middle of the action. the ""Monsoon"" restaurant that provides room service and breakfast had a vast menu and was a great place to sit and people watch. Staff were  excellent , very helpful. Rooftop pool cool relief after sightseeing. Suite was spacious and clean. all in all ,great accomodation and great value. ",4,0.9929
best hotel in bangkok we really enjoyed our stay excellent location in the centre and 2 minutes walk from bts the main sky train that will take you every where in the city. They almost clean the room twice a day. They receive you with a great smile every time you get back to the hotel. ,5,0.9661
"The bed and pillows are so comfortable that I don’t feel like leaving the room. If it wasn’t for my hunger to look for food, I wouldn’t have left the room. The staff are friendly and helpful. I definitely recommend this hotel as it is so close by to everything that you need - food, BTS, pubs and massages",5,0.9427
"Outstanding service by smiling, friendly, courteous, and helpful people from arriving at BKK to my departure. My room was outstanding, as were the breakfasts provided by the attached restaurant.  I would stay there again.",5,0.9652
"I stayed with my  wife for 4 nights as part of a visit to  Thailand. I would strongly recommend this accommodation. Very professional  and clean, great touches such  as the cold towel on arrival and provision of emergency  shave and dental kits.  Bed was super comfy, and Jane on the reception was brilliant in organising an  early  taxi  for us for our early  start  return  to the  airport. The gym  was great and the breakfast food excellent with  a good mix of thai  and western. Add that the attached restuarent which  was also  excellent, and its favourable location - I would highly  recommned and will be returning.",5,0.9851
"Clean and comfortable ,strongly recommend to stay in this hotel, very close to the bts Nana station and there are a night market nearby, or  there is a lots of massage, bar and restaurants, just walk around if you feel hungry and tired ",5,0.7717
"Nice and clean hotel,Hotel is located in Sukhumvit 8 only a few minutes walk to Skyline. Nice pool on the top of the building. Room nice and clean,room come with small kitchen and you can cook your own food. But remember there is a restaurant downstairs and very crowd at nice. ",4,0.9287
"I stayed 3 nights at a different Bangkok property and then went to Chiang Mai for 4 nights before staying at Adelphi my last night in Thailand. My expectations were low, as I did not love sukhumvit the week earlier. However, I found both the hotel, and Soi 8 to be much better than expected. The hotel staff were excellent and professional. They even gave me a sim ejector when I’d asked for a paper clip. Very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was really good. Pool area beautiful. Room was clean and top notch. Street was far enough off Suk to actually have some charm and neighborhood vibe. Street level Monsoon was cool too. All in all, well worth the price. ",4,0.9783
"Stayed in queen suite twice, because I wanted a clothes washing machine. Breakfast was excellent and staff always very kind. Very large and clean room for the money. Very close to Nana station. Sometimes air-con a little noisy. One time the bathroom sink stopper did not function at all. Washing machine can be tricky to use (no instructions!).",4,0.8639
"A home away from home. The suite is clean and the bed &amp; pillow is comfortable. Good breakfast.   Love the location! Walking distance from Nana Station. Shopping at Terminal 21 is just one station away. Happening place. With street vendors just down the street and many spa/massage place to choose from, for a little pampering. Restaurants and bars which open till 2am (but not noisy) are just around the corner. Art Box which opens daily from 4pm till midnight is 5 minutes walk away.",5,0.9245
Took the deluxe suite n studio  both were  clean n spacious. Check in was fine except that only one rm was ready so we had our luggage sent there first. Front desk receptionists were friendly and helpful. the breakfast was of standard fare but the drawback is the room is very warm  we have been there in our last trips and the aircon is still not gd. the problem is probably the room has 2 more doors which open to the outside dining area which some patrons use for smoking  As a result the doors allow hot air to enter.  perhaps management might want to consider double doors  ,3,0.9114
"This is the second time I stayed at the Adelphi Suites. Once again, the staff was friendly and helpful, and the room was pretty much the same as last time. It was large, quiet, and decently priced. In addition, the air conditioning worked well! This hotel is very convenient to the Skytrain, shopping, restaurants, and other nightlife.",5,0.8908
"2019, stayed on November 9. The people at the information center were so kind. Especially, I don't know the name of the female employee and one person who has the The room was large and the resident type was good, and the location was good. I hope to see you again. I miss CREAM and BANGKOK ㅠㅠ  2019년 11월 9일에 머물렀다. 인포메이션에 있는 직원들은 너무나 친절했고 특히 cream 이름을 가진 여자 직원분과 한명은 이름을 모르겠다. 룸도 크고 레지던스 타입이라 좋았고 위치도 좋다. cream 다시 만나길 바란다.",5,0.9094
"The staff were very friendly overall, although if you ask what's the best way to Ayuttaya they will say you can't go by train, you can ;)  We had a good view on the 7th floor but I think anything lower than that may be slightly disappointing, definitely aim for higher if you can!  The hotel is in a great location right next to the BTS station Nana, which was very convenient throughout our stay but hard so say in a Thai accent, Sukhumvit in general is an interesting location lets say that. Lots of markets around and massaging parlours wolf whistling as you walk past, I like to think it was because I'm slightly attractive.   Nearby rooftop bar called Above Eleven is great and you'll feel like your in an exclusive club or a Bond movie. There is more to choose from but this was the",5,0.9833
"The hotel is in a great location just off Sukhumvit road. It's situated on Soi 8 which is quiet and only 5 minutes walk from the BTS at Nana. Friendly staff, quick check in. The rooms are a great size with everything you need. Comfortable bed, good air con and good WiFi. Storage is plentiful and they have bathrobes and an iron and board in the room. Bathroom is massive and the water pressure is very good. Overall it's an excellent hotel and I would stay here again",5,0.9774
"We have just spent five days in this excellent hotel. As we are on a four week trip, we thought it best to book a condo that was central, but also one where we could launder our dirty clothes, so hence the reason we booked one of the larger suites. It had a bedroom, bathroom and lounge/ kitchen diner.....plenty of space for all our luggage and it had the much needed washer/dryer! We would also highly recommend the attached Monsoon restaurant where breakfasts were superb, as was dinner.  Definitely worth a visit. ",5,0.9514
I had a wonderful stay at this Hotel. Facilities are second to none and the staff are wonderful.Jane and Cream on reception in particular were very helpful and friendly and contributed to my lovely holiday at this hotel,5,0.9498

"It was really awesome stay at Adelphi, specially rooms are superb, hygienic, rooftop swimming pool and with all features in rooms. I loved it so much, if any future plan in Bangkok then sure I will choose Adelphi Suites only. ",5,0.9402
"I returned to Bangkok after over 3 decades, for leisure for the first time. My skepticism about the hotel (while booking after reading Trip Adviser comments and ratings)  left me after i reached inside the hotel. Truly friendly staff at check in. Particularly Ms Nanni. When I reached the suite itself I was convinced I had reached the right hotel from the room perspective.. The Nana metro station was 3 to 4 minutes away. I explored Bangkok using the Metro. No matter how tired I was while returning, it was a 4 minute walk and the hotel offered every comfort and sense of safety and relaxation that one could ask for. A restaurant on the ground floor served excellent breakfast. With superb service. The menu was not too large but I had a few meals in the room. Very good food served.  ",4,0.9386
The room was spacious and clean. The staff was very friendly and efficient. The only thing missing was a real pool service. The pool is very small and there is no staff for ordering a drink for example.  Otherwise a great location. Recommendable place.,4,0.8737

Bohdi and her team (especially, Cream, Tanya and Sang - everyone infact). The restaurant (Monsoon) is good value and the Thai dishes are top class! Make sure you try this little gem! Thank you Adelphi!",5,0.965
"Highly recommended stayed here loads ,great staff ,clean rooms,very convenient for the sky train loads of great places to eat nearby. Will retain its peacefulness when they have finished building the new hotel opposite ,not that it bothered me. Great to swim a few lengths in the pool ",5,0.9689
The room was clean and tidy from the get go. The staff is super friendly and they have guest-friendly policies. My room was spacious. The only complaint I would have is the lights in the room aren't that bright but they are good enough. All in all worth it ,5,0.8518
"Super room with nice view, nice gym and pool at the roof.... only bad thing is no kids playing area...... Peter in the reception was extra kind and supportive helping us all around... restaurant was also nice and good breakfast included....room cleaning service is also very good ... would recommend to everyone... you should try the hotel ... the hotel is near to metro and very central .... I would always come here again and without any doubt. Peter the bellboy can organize a great tour of Ayutthaya for a very good price. I would stay here again the next time I am in Bangkok. The shower was good, the room service and the food was great... the room had a safe and nice big tv",5,0.99

"For  the first time I had a bad experience with the hotel Adelphi after booking a twin studio with twin beds via internet, after having paid, after receiving a confirmation email for a studio twin  from the hotel, I arrived and there  was no Twin studio but instead a room with a queen bed and an extra bed.  The extra bed is a child's bed measuring 1.80 m which is not comfortable for an adult.  It was very disappointing.  Beware of their  internet booking system prefer telephone. ",3,-0.903

Lots of nice restaurants nearby as well as a small ‘street food’ style market called Art Box. There is good Thai massage close by as well as money changer access. The breakfast was good with traditional Thai as well as American breakfast. Good size room with kitchenette and nice views. The place has a small boutique like feel but with top service. Front desk staff is genuinely caring and a good source for recommendations.  Housekeeping was also excellent and kept us well stocked. ",5,0.9844
Very clean hotel. Friendly staff. Big rooms. Good WiFi. Great breakfast. Nearby BTS station. Many restaurants around. Aircon on the floor. No mosquitoes. Not the last time I have been here. I feel very comfortable here,5,0.9418
Adelphi suites Sukhumvit Soi 8 is a great place to stay and never disappoints. The staff are friendly and the place is very hospitable. A place the family 👪 always longs to be back to. So conveniently located near Nana BTS 🚉 and accessible from the the main Sukhumvit road. I will always desire to be back here,5,0.9039
"When I made the reservation, I thought this was a generic 4/5 star hotel, but when I arrived there first time, they were really full of care with me, even had a groom to bring my luggage to my room and showing me the room! They also made my room and the check in 30mn/1hour earlier than the first check in time possible.  The room was nice, also the cleaning staff was really kind,they give you free clean towel everyday to change, two big water glass bottle and the view is really nice (even if there are construction sites right now).  I do recommend this hotel as the location, the room, the personal makes this stay a pleasure!  -Alexandre",5,0.9848
"Enjoyable stay in general. Receptionists and all staff were friendly and helpful. Used the rooftop pool, plenty of towels were provided.  If you are a perfectionist, one picky pointsshould be noted. There was a temple right next to the hotel. As I stayed on 6/F, there was some kind of music to be played early in the morning (like 7am or 8am). I must say the music was not loud inside our room, but it did make us wake up because of it. This is minor in my opinion and hence I keep my 5-star rating for this hotel. ",5,0.7506
Excellent Hotel &amp; very helpful staff. Our bedroom suite was first class - a bit too much for a 2 night stay - and the restaurant (Monsoon) was excellent for an evening meal and more than adequate for breakfast.  Hotel location is also very good on Soi 8 which is pleasantly lively. Well positioned by Nana BTS station making city travel and airport access simple.,5,0.9718
"Very nice hotel, very helpful staff! The breakfast changed everyday and the room was clean, spacious, with everything required to make your stay comfortable! I recommend this place very close to Nana BTS station",5,0.9357

"When I go to Bangkok I always stay close to to the action and the best place for sure is Adelphi Suites in Sukhumvit 8. Its a great Hotel close to Nana BTS Skytrain, the rooms are first class and the Monsoon Restaurant has a great buffet breakfast. Its good as its close to everything, bars,clubs,for tours etc, but just away from the noise for a good sleep of a night I found. Would recommend to anyone and I will be going back again next time I go. ",5,0.9468
"Nice hotel in a great location with a quality bar/restaurant on the ground floor. Soi 8 has a good choice of bars and restaurants to choose from, with Monsoon being one of the best. It's a short walk from the BTS (Nana), so all in all, a great location. The staff were always polite and helpful the entire time. The pool is small, but everything else more than makes up for it.",5,0.8873
"This was my 3rd or 4th time staying at Adelphi Suites Bangkok. I tried a different hotel once and regretted it. Nothing beats this hotels perfect location. The staff was just as friendly and helpful since I last remembered. This time around I split my stay into two separate 3 day stays. I had a 2 day stay at Adelphi's Pattaya location. Bekoing that I returned to the same floor on my second Bangkok Adelphi stay, the housekeeping lady remembered me and also remembered my request for more towels and hooked me up again without even asking. Front desk staff is super nice and professional.

"We rented a corner suite for 4 nights. Suite was equipped basically but clean and new. Good matrass, 2 tv screens, kitchen and quick wifi. Not far from Prohm Pong bts station. Quit environment, gentle and helpfull staff. Efficient checkin and out.",4,0.9428
"Just a few steps from Nana BTS station and Terminal 21 the location of this hotel is outstanding, its a little way back from Sukhumvit so feels a lot more relaxed and not so frenetic. The staff were friendly, accommodating and very helpful, they always had a smile and a greeting. The buffet breakfast was excellent and the bar a relaxing place to have a beer at the end of the evening. Our studio room was huge, very clean and even though there was construction going on directly opposite very well sound insulated. The aircon was a little noisey for us but because we don't really sleep with it on back home in Australia we're not used to it I dont think it would be a problem for most people. We used the pool and gym every day and everytime we visited it wasn't busy or crowded and",5,0.9133

"When I am in Bangkok I always stay in this hotel. The service is great, the people are always more then nice. I love the location at in soi 8. It is near to the BTS and there are lots of nice restaurants, bars in the neighbourhood.  The rooms are very clean and comfortable. And the restaurant Monsoon serves a very good breakfast and have nice food on the menu.  And also important, they offer good prices. ",5,0.9856
"I made a mistake and booked a one bedroom premier room for two nights. Shortly before my trip, I decided to book another day to coincide with my other two bookings, so I went ahead and booked my usual one bedroom suite, not realizing my first booking mistake.   The front desk called and made me aware of what I had done, all the suites were booked, so i wasn't able to upgrade. They were extremely polite and even mentioned they were also surprised that I hadn't booked a suite originally like I always do, have stayed here multiple times  Anyway, they moved me to a great room, everything worked out fine!   Checking in and out is smooth, the staff is wonderful and even the new trainee (Lee) , I think that was her name, sorry if I got that wrong handled everything like a pro, credit",5,0.8805
"This was my first time staying in Adelphi suites. I stayed in one bedroom suite for two nights. Room was clean, spacious and with the nice view. Hotel restaurant was good and the whole staff very friendly and helpful. Gym was kind of standard and a little dissapointing, but comparable to other hotels at the same standard in Bangkok. It has a nice but small pool just beside the gym, so that was a plus. The best thing however was the location. Just couple of hundred meters from Nana BTS station, so it was very convenient. Overall nice experience and I would stay there again.",5,0.969

"I stayed here for 4 nights on a business trip to Bangkok. Its located in the heart of Sukimvhit so is close to all of the amenities. Its a busy and popular and busy part of Bangkok. Plenty to see around the hotel, near to the Artbox outdoor market (which was great for food, drinks and live music), and well served by the tour operators for pickup/drop offs.   The hotel is well equipped with large/comfortable rooms. A roof top pool is nice and reasonably equipped gym although the access door was a bit temperamental and not all of the equipment worked.   The staff are all very friendly and helpful. I would recommend and definitely stay again.",4,0.9763

"Adelphi Suites Bangkok always do justice for me in terms of check-in, room cleanliness, breakfast, convenience of travel as its very close to the BTS Nana Station (abt 5 mins walk). Each and every staff member is well trained and service was fast whenever you need them. Very respectful staff. Although they have cable TV but I still prefer to bring my own comedy series DVDs and request for a DVD Player to be connected to the TV. A comfortable 5 nights stay and its always at Adelphi Suites Bangkok!",5,0.9168
"The location is excellent, only 3 minutes away from the BTS Nana station. Artbox night market is nearby . The staff is very friendly and helpful. The room is spacious and clean. It's a very comfortable stay and I will come again.",5,0.9481

Only 1-2 min walk to nana BTS station Rooms were clean and the bed was comfy Outdoor pool was very good for an afternoon relaxation and refreshment Breakfast was also good with different selections Very nice experience at this hotel and definitely choose it again for another travel to Bangkok ,5,0.9869
"Great place, great people, everything in the suite met my needs very well.   I also enjoyed the quiet of the pool which is really important if you come from a cold climate. The street life nearby is exotic, but if it not for you, then just walk on by. I will be back soon!!",5,0.8485
"Beautiful and clean big room. Service is premier, everyone is friendly and helpful at the front desk. I like particularly Peter, nice and efficient. Breakfast - asiatic and western - is very good with an omelette corner.",5,0.9725
"Comfortable, clean and well located for central Bangkok.   Stayed in 1 bed standard suite which was well equipped, quiet, modern and spacious. Perfect for my wife, toddler and I.   Any issue we had was promptly dealt with by the staff.  The pool and gym are not huge but perfectly adequate for the location.  Excellent bar/restaurant downstairs which was very busy every night. The breakfast was filling but not the best quality with some rather unusual dishes for breakfast time. It’s probably only negative point.  Location ideal for Nana Station and shopping. Close enough to nightlife without being intruding.  As long as price is competitive I would definitely bring the family back  ",5,0.8134
"Visited with wife and 4 year old son in August 2019z stayed in the 1 bed room suite. Checkin was smooth and staff communicated in English properly. Room was spotless with everything provided. Bed was large and comfortable enough for 3 people. Bathroom had both tub and shower. Kitchenette was properly equipped and the washer/dryer was useful.  Breakfast had a decent spread of thai food, salads, continental, etc. Seating available both inside and outside. Wasn’t too hot outside as they had the mist fan running. Lots of food stalls outside during the day and night. Hainanese chicken rice was my favourite as well as the thai milk tea stalls. Foodpanda and Grab Foo make fast deliveries as well if you want to stay in for your meals.  Located next to a 7 eleven and a 3 min walk to Nana",5,0.9001
Stayed for 5 nights. Appreciate the early check in as well as the complimentary one way airport transfer that came with the promotion. We felt very welcomed  that the hotel staff including the concierge staff remembered us as we have stayed here a few times. Will be great if late check out was possible but we were told that the hotel was fully booked on that day. Nevertheless will definitely choose to stay here again. ,5,0.8833
Staff were very helpful. Room and toilet are very clean. Pantry and cutleries provided are also very clean.A little disappointed with breakfast provided; can improve by keep by keeping the food warm at all times.,5,0.7792
"Welcoming Staffs &amp; Reception very friendly - love at first step !  Room is very cozy ; love especially the bed. I could have slept whole day in that - well done.   Breakfast is exceptionally well !! got everything you would have wanted for breakfast. (fruit, dairy, eggs, western, Thai style = all blended in nice.y)  Location is perfect !!! slept til 11pm then woke up and wander around Soi Nana until 2am then had Brinner near Foodland at 3am. Awesome.   5 Minutes walk from Hotel to BTS (Nana station) and if you prefer walking, only 15 minute walk to Terminal 21 and Soi Cowboy - couldn't ask for more.     ",4,0.9826
"This was our first time at Adelphi Suites and we were very pleased. The one-bedroom apartment was a good size, clean, quiet, and very comfortable. There is a great restaurant downstairs for breakfast and it also serves meals and drinks during the day. The staff were also most friendly and welcoming and we would definitely stay here again.

"Excellent location, two-minute walk to Nana BTS, room I stayed in was relatively quiet even with a construction site just meters away. Excellent housekeeping staff. Room kept clean throughout the 5 days I stayed. Breakfast at the Monsoon Restaurant was good. I like the environmentally friendly amenities provided: glass water bottles, refillable soap, shampoo, conditioner and shower gel. It would have been nice if lotion was also provided. Overall, good value for your money for a 4-star hotel. The elevators are key-card operated, which adds a level of security. One of the two elevators was out of order intermittently over 2 days, but wait time was still manageable. Staff was friendly and courteous. A small pool and gym located on 16/F.",5,0.9731
"The apartment is spacious with fantastic amenities. Everything is to a high standard, including the attentive staff. The breakfast is a great blend of Western and Thai food. It is a 5min walk to the metro. I will return to Adelphi Suites with my family. Great Hotel!",5,0.92

"Room was clean.  I stayed here in July after first staying here in 2018. Overall was no problem. I found morning breakfast not as appealing as my stay in 2018. Different cooks? Also,  seats in breakfast area should have no arm rests as area is small and difficult to get around. Ian",4,-0.7096
"Stayed from 7/9-12 in a one bedroom suite. Spacious n clean with wooden floor! There are stoves , fringe n microwave . The balcony is huge n the beds r comfortable. Shower is good size with quite hot in water temperature. Receptionists were helpful ! The location is great , 5 min from Nana BTS. There’s Money exchange at the corner . Massage places  n pubs are close by! The Monsoon restaurant serves tasty food and the breakfast was fairly good! A good size gym is unexpected for such small hotel. A roof top pool is located next to the gym with great night city light.",4,0.9834
Hotel location is excellent just off Sukhumvit road and close to BTS sky train station. Room cleanliness and size were all very good value for the mid range price. Hotel staff also friendly and spoke fairly good English. Only complaint was my request for a later check out was denied as the hotel was supposedly fully booked. However when I checked hotel availability there were rooms available. Apart from this my stay was most enjoyable.,3,0.9332
"Really nice hotel with excellent convenient location. The room are spacious and the staff are polite and helpful. The buffet breakfast has not much to choose but it taste well. The swimming at 16th floor, though not large, but is marvellous. However, when you look into details, you can see some small places are not well maintained. Like the surface holding shower gel and shampoo, it seems it will fall if you press it harder.  It overall is a satisfactory experience.",4,0.8802
Second time I have stayed and found to be an awesome hotel.  Jane and Nanni in front counter welcome you warmly and give the best front counter experience I have ever encountered in my many overseas trips. Location awesome Breakfast awesome  Rooms awesome Staff awesome Maybe that little bit more expensive than same hotels but this is by far the best,5,0.9719

The swimming pool is beautiful, especially lovely in the evening, and the gym is well equipped and very clean.  I highly recommend this hotel",5,0.9866

"We booked the One Room Suite at Adelphi because of the convenient location and the availability of a washing machine.  Adelphi is a 2-min walk to Nana BTS station. It is on a street off Sukhumvit Rd. The area has a feel of backpackers neighbourhood, but there are big hotels on the opposite side of Sukhumvit Rd.  The room and fitout looked rather tired. Comfortable and plenty of space for 2 people.   Breakfast was really bland and boring. We decided not to eat in the hotel after our first morning.   The doorman was very helpful. Walked all the way out to Sukhumvit Rd to hail a taxi for us for our trip to airport. Kudos to him.  Overall, the experience didn't match the price tag of 12,000 Baht for 3 nights. We should have chosen another hotel, and find a laundromat. Haha.  ",3,0.9061
"Reception service and staffs are nice, helpful and good attitude. Nice service for check-in with welcome drink. Near BTS Nana Station, go there by walk within 5 mins.  Near massage shop, convenient store and hawker, no worries for eating.",4,0.8519
"This was just a very short stay but everything was perfect. A phone call to make sure we are coming. Check in was fantastic considering this was a stay that had been moved from March to July at no charge. The room was brilliant and we stayed on the pool floor. We had a suite and it was huge. 2 televisions, a washing machine and all the usual things you’d find in a good hotel. Location on Soi 8 is just great. It’s a great little Soi and the hotel is a few hundred meters from the BTS Nana station. Breakfast is at Monsoon restaurant which was fantastic. Great selection. Check out was again no issues. Friendly, smiling staff who always look after their guests.",5,0.9952
