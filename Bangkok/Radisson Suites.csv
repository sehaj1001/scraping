"A good place to stay whilst waiting for our return to the UK during the Covid 19 outbreak. Excellent staff, comfortable beds and good food.  Within walking distance of many restaurants, although at least one evening meal in the hotel restaurant is essential.",5,0.9153
I spent 3 nights here in early July.  I was very pleased with the room and the general ambience of the hotel.  The staff were very helpful especially the young lady who was working when we did an early check out on the Friday.  She was very attentive and made us coffee whilst we waited for the taxi.    The swimming pool area is somewhat underdeveloped and could be improved. The rooms are very good.  Probably about the best I have stayed in in its price bracket. Likewise the breakfast dining room which is a real pleasure both in ambience and service.,5,0.966
"This was our third time staying at Radisson Suites Bangkok. As usual, the entire staff was welcoming, kind and helpful. The food in the Punjab Grill as well as at Asqu was always of high quality and delicious. Also, enjoyed singing  familiar tunes along with the tuk tuk driver as we were delivered to our stop!!! Again, you won't be disappointed staying at the Radisson Suites. We recommend it.  ",5,0.968
"Stayed here for two nightâ€™s with my bf and we were so pleased with our stay! The room was really nice, good AC, clean etc. The staff was very friendly and helpful. My bf asked for bandage and they even put it on for him! ðŸ˜® Rooftop pool was also very nice to relax in after some time out on town. Only thing I can say as critic, is that a few more sunbeds and furniture in general would be good. But I definitely would recommend anyone to stay here! ",5,0.9857
"The hotel is really central, they provide a free shuttle to the nearest BTS , MRT &amp; Shopping Mall this service was great as there was no timetable but you would simply tell them where you wanted to go and they would immediately take you. The hotel room was clean and spacious, we were told that we had been given a recently renovated room. The staff were outstanding, they were extremely polite , friendly and curious. The hotel restaurant and the buffet breakfast are also really good and I would recommend them. I would also like to thank the hotel for the in-room welcome gift of a fresh bowl of fruit and a beer as a Radisson Gold member. I had no issues whatsoever and will definitely return next time I come to Bangkok .",5,0.9933
"Checked in to the hotel for four nights as our first destination. From the minute we arrived we felt very welcomed and looked after.  Hotel was lovely, room was very spacious and comfortable, free shuttle service if wanted to and from the train station. Staff were very professional, highly recommend :) pool was lovely to cool down in late afternoon and the gym facilities and jacuzzi was great to start the day.   Staff kindly printed our boarding passes for our next flight, luckily they offered us advice on how to get to the airport as we were heading to the wrong one lol 10/10!! ",5,0.9888
"Front desk staff is super nice.. and the little rooftop pool is nice. I just wish there was more sunbeds as many times we went there they wore all taken.  rooms are nice and big. comfy beds. And really nice with that tuk tuk service they have.  But the spa is well.. eeh.. I was numerous times during my massage asked if I wanted a Happy ending and she was trying more and more to accidentally massage my private area. It did go that far that I just ended the massage.  i know this is normal in Thailand, but never experiensed that on a Hotel Spa before.",4,0.8182
my vacation was perfect. if i come to bangkok again certanly my chosie would be radison suits  .. the hotels location is perfect  it is so close to go  all  entertaiment area i love bangkong  and  radison suits,3,0.9118
"Always my most preferred choice in bkk. Good location, exclusive, good service, good food. The only thing i always don't  like is the sound proofing of the room's main door.... when you neighbouring guest closed their door, you will get a shocked. ",5,0.6994
"Hotel needs a lot because windows can't be open air-conditions gives bed smell, room furniture playing extra time for not die, carpets are very old. Location is good and Staff s are amazing. Rooms are clean but everything very old looks so its appearing is not clean. The rooms are excellent size so its great for solo traveller.",3,0.973
"With concern I booked the Radissons suites, previous reservation was not held by them although I had the confirmed paperwork  Arriving early were advised our room, one bedroom suite ( that included breakfast)  ready soon and gave us a voucher for drinks -  again a long wait - well beyond check in time . We noted the bathroom smelt bad - Urine?  The bed linen was thread bare, actually had a hole worn through it prompting to report to housekeeping - seriously  Not expected at a hotel that is not cheap and that passes itself off as 4 stars.  On arrival at breakfast were advised our room was not on the list so back to reception ( same check in receptionist) to resolve - told in a very loud and patronising voice - our room did not include Breakfast and she stated had emphatically",1,-0.0516
Nice hotel with excellent service. The staff always assist you with a smile. Walking distance from shopping center and restaurants. Walking distance from BTS Skytrain which can bring you around Bangkok and to the airport. Nice breakfast buffet with a good choice of international food.,5,0.9287
"Good hotel with good price, location was good enjoyed the stay, drop service by tuk tuk was good, breakfast was good need put some more varieties in menu, travel to other locations were easy,worth it to stay as per price.",4,0.9403
"The staff are great, good first impression but then you get into your room and it's downhill from there... Shower was dirty and mould everywhere,  the only hotel shower that I've felt the need to wear thongs in! Obviously previous guests had long straight hair because it is all over the floor... I don't think the room was vaccumed between guests! Room wasn't made up the next day,  we had to go to reception at 4.30 and ask for clean towels...no apology for not cleaning room... On the upside, great coffee downstairs,  friendly staff and the pool guy is very nice... Really disappointed as this could have been a nice place except for the fact that the room was dirty and their is absolutely no excuse, I would suggest they need more cleaning staff so that they are able to clean",1,0.931
"On the whole, this place is quite fine to stay at in general and you'll be comfortable. Service staff are polite and have excellent language skills, rooms are spacious and very clean.   However, it does come with some caveats. Those caveats merely represent the product you receive not being commensurate with the money you'll pay. You see, everything here on the whole is generally good, but I found a lot of the faucets loose or broken, some door fittings were simply not maintained properly and the condition of the appliances was rather substandard. Back when this place was cheaper, one could easily overlook these items simply because this place was half the price of most other properties nearby. Another thing being that the location of this hotel is quite a long way from the main",3,0.4201
We had another delightful stay at the Radisson Bangkok. From the moment you arrive until you depart you are always treated as long lost family. The Staff are always friendly &amp; treat you like royalty. The Hotel is maintained &amp; always improving them selves which makes your stay more comfortable &amp; enjoyable. Congratulation's to Management &amp; Staff for a job we done.,5,0.961
"Located on the quiet Sukhumvit Soi 13 Radisson Suites is a great hotel with very spacious, clean rooms, very comfortable beds(king size) and very friendly, attentive and effective staff making it a great stay in Bangkok!  Breakfast buffet is very extensive and tasty and fresh!  Location is great in the quiet Soi 13 but just 2 minutes walk around the corner is busy and bustling Soi 11 offering a wide variety of good restaurants, bars, and massage places! Highly recommended!",5,0.9703
"Sas Radisson is always a good choice and also this time,booked a 1 bedroom suite for 2 days,and location is good just a few meters walk down to sukhumvit road,even if they have free shuttle i use to walk for some exersice,the room was amazing ,2 bathrooms 3 tv, one bedroom, one workroom and a livingroom and a small kitchen,maybe the best room i ever had,staff nice and proffesional even if checkin and check out takes little bit to long,swimming pool area was under renovation but still worked,had no breakfast so there i cant tell,wifi was to slow,thats sad with a hotel like this,so if wifi worked better and breakfast had been included in room price it had been a very strong 5 ,now i will give a strong 4,after checked out i find out that i got overpriced my minibar drinks,i had 2",4,0.9678
"Some floors already done and some will be done later.  The newly redesigned room are a little too classic. The rest of the hotel like reception and pool still needs a update.  The breakfast is nice,  especially appreciate the barista coffee. ",3,0.807
hotel was luxury to stay and it was middle of city good location the rooms are big and fully hygienic i like to stay again the hotel is very caring and friendly location was convenient and close to all,5,0.9124
Clean hotel and good value for money. When I was there end of November 2019m they were renovating the place so the swimming pool was closed and you could hear the people working from 8 am (lots of noise).,3,0.7906
We stayed for a night on 24-Oct. Located in great location. Around 10 minutes walk from Nana station. Everything nearby. We booked directly from their website and both of our room got upgraded to suite :) Food was excellent. We tried Khao Pad in their restaurant which was best during our Thailand trip. We had flight at night and we left hotel in the morning keeping luggage in the hotel. It was safe and so nice of them. Recommended to all my friends.,4,0.9774
"The hotel is very caring and friendly. The rooms are very big and spacious. It is very nice for Indians as It offers Indian Breakfast, room service is also very nice. Their are plenty of restaurants around the hotel but its Indian Punjabi restaurant is very costly. Their is a supermarket in front of the hotel  that provides many of the Indian food products. The hotels pool is very nice and overall the hotel is very nice and you can choose this as your stay. This hotel will give an inexplicable experience.",5,0.9301
Better to avoid this place if you are excepting a Radisson standard experience. The place looks shabby with maintenance going on. The room smells of cigarette though it was a non smoking room on a non smoking floor. Very poor value for money. ,2,-0.0038
This was like any other 4 start hotels. Found nothing extraordinary or charming about this place. Location was convenient and close to all malls. I requested for a thermometer and in a mechanical voice i was told that I can go to 7 eleven across the street to get it. I have had many pleasant experience from many other hotels in situations like this and here I saw no effort to make the stay pleasant. Breakfast was ordinary - nothing great. Spread was mostly asian.,3,0.465
Breakfast are great various and good but the room needs to be redo. It is old and the bed mattress also . This hotel needs to be makeover.. The staff are very helpful and smily and give a goood service at hte buffet in the morning.,3,0.8243
I used agoda to find a 5 star hotel in or around soi 13.  This came up in soi 13 and was priced well and offered huge savings.  I booked 3 nights.  Checked in at 11 pm so not offered welcome drink or fruits.  Staff were great throughout our stay and I would say they were 5 star hosts.  My complaints were the rooms.  The room i was given were barely 3 stars.  5 star rooms are immaculate but this room was dirty and very shabby.  Just a few photos attached for reference.  When booking I was led to believe rooms were usually 13 000 baht for 1 night so I expected high standards.  I was badly let down.  Room not worth the 2700 baht I paid.  Drills and hammering throughout the day did not help.  Breakfast buffet was good.  Again staff were superb and very attentive.  I will never use,3,-0.092
Close to local night clubs and other amenities. Service staff of the hotel is very friendly and helpful. Rooms are decent and big enough. The Punjabi grill restaurant attached to hotel was surprisingly very nice and had good options of food and have a wide range of food menu.,5,0.9294
"Loved the place for its location n tuktuk pickups n drop service as many times. Loved the welcoming drinks n snacks. Loved all staffs continuous greetings. In one sentence, quiet cozy with all required amenities ",5,0.9485
"Went to this hotel with my colleague for a day on the way to Philipinnes for a official trip. We reached early at 9 am, but they arranged one out of two room for us immediately. The location is little inside main road and it is actually a four star property (though agoda claimed 5 star). As a four star property undoubtedly the tariff is very high. However, the property is very clean, rooms are large, toilet extremely clean, breakfast is also very good (we found a thai cook who eventually stayed in India for 8 years and can cook some Indian foods). I must mention the excellent &amp; friendly behaviour of all the staffs. They also have a cart to drop you and pick you up from various points of Sukhumvit road.",4,0.9689
It was my second stay in Radisson Suits Soi13 Sukhumvit Bangkok. They upgraded to a better suit of their own. Punjab gril service and food is superb. Complimentary Tuktuk service helps distance from main road,5,0.91
"My Thai partner and I were very impressed with this hotel, the service and attention to detail was immaculate.   Unfortunately, we only stayed for the day, however next time we are in Bangkok we will definitely be staying here again.  It is such a relief to find a hotel that you are happy with and not need to look further.   ",5,0.8883
"We just stayed for one night, however, we had already stored out luggage there beforehand to continue on our travels a bit lighter. The staff assisted us above and beyond their duties. Everybody at the hotel is a absolute delight. Facilities are clean and well attended to. Breakfast was yummy as well. Would stay there again. ",5,0.9217
The attitude towards Indian need to be changed by staff and you should not have to different yardstick towards Europeans and Americans. As all are paying the same amount of money then why different in attitude.,4,0
"The reception, rooms, cleanliness, food, room services, generally all are really good. There is no unnecessary disturbance for guests. Some arrangement for tour arrangements, taxi services(genuine fare), may well be arranged with the hotel reception still more better way.",5,0.5699
"We stayed here just for 1 night and loved it. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful.  In the morning we decided to go for a swim and had the pool to ourselves, which was fab..and it was a decent size. The breakfast.. was really good!!! The cashew and veg stir-fry, pastries, fruit, Thai omelette lattes.. all really good. ",5,0.9566
"Nice hotel,  located a bit far from the BTS if you miss the shuttle service provided by the hotel, but makes it quiet. Good point there is a supermarket in front, even being near the end of soi 13. Great rooftop jacuzzi and swimming pool.",5,0.9022
"The hotel is on the same street as a lot of other hotels in this area, but the name is a bit confusing for tuk-tuks to find. The hardest part was getting there. Is it the Raddison? Is it the ""In Residence""? We eventually had to use google maps to show the driver, but it worked out.  There is tons of night life right outside and down the street within walking distance. The Artbox market, food, street vendors, shops, etc. Also a short ride to Terminal 21, the MRT, and the Emporium mall.  The staff is great, they communicate well, and the rooms are clean, fresh, and relaxing.  I LOVE THE SHOWER AND BATHTUB.",5,0.9799
I have always selected the same option to stay when traveling to Bangkok for the last ten years. Radisson Suites provides great value for money but the real reason for being a regular here is its staff. I have not across a more helpful group anywhere else in my travels.,5,-0.0189
"The rooms are just alright. They might be big but the unrenovatebd ones are quite dated. The renovated ones are slightly better but the design and planning was odd with the washbasin next to the TV almost in the bedroom itself.   Location is a good 7-10 minute walk from Nana BTS. They do have a shuttle pickup/ drop off. I think a hotel/ apartments near Siam would be a better bet.  We had multiple rooms at the property and at the 14:00 check in time we were given only 2 rooms. And we got all rooms only by 17:00.   When it came to check out, they were unwilling to give us a late checkout upto 14:00 (even though we had to leave for the airport at 17:00) for even one room. The Front Office staff was almost rude about it. Only when we pointed out the late check in time and that they",3,0.404
"Excellet Accommodation , Warm People , Great Wifi , Out of the world gourmet experience. I think it was 110% Perfect stay . We would definitely stay in this place whenever an opportunity to visit bangkok arise.",5,0.9349
Over all got good experience . Room was good but bathroom was so close with the room that we were getting the smell. Sliding was very tight and every time force was required too much. Beds and room minibar was excellent. House keeping service also was very good,4,0.9153
Perfect location. 10min away from mÃ©tro. Spacious room. Nice roof top with small swimming pool. Staff helping and kind. The dÃ©coration is a bit outdated but it is clean overall. Internet is possible even if a bit slow. ,4,0.875
We stayed our first days in Bangkok in the radisson as it is quite close to Terminal 21 and Asok BTS.  The distance to Terminal 21 is about 10-12 minutes by walk or you take the shuttle offered by the hotel.   Even the shuttle left some minutes before you ask for you have to wait at max. 10 minutes. In the heat of Bangkok it is good to take the shuttle ;-)  Everybody was very kind and friendly and supported in the hotel.   For me (in person) the bath-area is just seperated by a glas sliding wall to the sleeping room.,4,0.924

"Out of the hotels we stayed at in Thailand, this was the most disappointing. The rooms are a bit dated and also felt damp. When we arrived, there was some poop in the toilet in our room. Our room was also not cleaned at the end of the next day (even though we did not leave the do not disturb sign on). The â€˜areaâ€™ shuttle service they provide is not really useful as it only really takes you to a train station. Would not stay at this place again.",1,-0.5733
"I actually loved my stay here. I must say the rooms are a bit old but they are huge and also the bed. if you are traveling with family this place will serve the purpose. The breakfast is good and could be better. I visited as i was here for medical check up, they provide complimentary drop off and pick up service to Bumrungrad, which is great. You can avoid the hustle and bustle of Soi 11 by staying here and yet be in  an accessible place. I would definitely stay here again.",4,0.9709
"Rooms dirty, humid, mould on the ceilings, around airconditioning, throughout the whole hotel, staff friendly and helpful, but that hotel has a serious problem with mould.

"First let me say the customer service at this hotel is EXCELLENT!!!! That being said, this was probably one of the worst experiences I've had at a hotel. When I arrived, I was placed in a smoking room...which I didn't realize until I woke up the next morning and couldn't breathe. I was moved immediately (thanks to the staff!!!) and realized the rooms here are damp....DAMP!!! I'm naturally allergic to mold, mildew and other environmental growths. Apparently this is the norm for Bangkok as every building I entered was damp. The last night it got so bad, I had to turn the AC to 69 degrees and sleep with my mask on....only to wake up with a persistent cough. I returned home to the States and had to go to urgent care.

"The staff is absolutely amazing.  Bow at the front desk has a pleasant personality, always smiling and ready to help.  She assisted me with replacing the mini bar fridge in my room and provided me with advice and recommendations during my stay. Her English language skills is outstanding and her professional yet relaxed attitude is impressive.   I highly recommend her for a Front Office Manager.

"I would not say Bangkok Radisson Suites is a 4 star hotel (like Expedia stated when booked) by a long shot if you compare to some of the other 4 star hotels I have stayed in. 4 star hotels by definition are supposed to be generally above average in quality, amenities, and service.

The bed and pillows were comfortable to sleep in. The only negative was the slight mildew smell in the room, but it was ok once the air conditioning was on. If the hotel decided to make a changes, I would suggest replacing the carpet or putting down wood/tile floors.

"Certainly not one of the youngest in the Radisson fleet this ageing lady is starting to show the test of time visible throughout the hotel. Could do with some ""quality"" maintenance.  That having been said  The rooms a very good size and well appointed, Hotel is spotlessly clean and the staff simply fantastic without exception.  Breakfast has good choice and quality for a moderate cost.   Set down Soi 13 a fair way I suspect quite a trek for some in the heat of the season to get to Sukhumvit main road. However this has the advantage that it is well away from the more colourful nightlife and quiet.  A good place for families.

"I stayed here for more than 2 weeks. Loved this hotel and their facilities. Their rooms are spacious with amenities like oven, fridge, iron, iron board, main switch control, air con central everywhere. The price was very good for this kind of room. It was a suite actually. The housekeeping staffs are very good at their job. The old lady in the housekeeping is very kind and refill my water bottle every time. I just did not like couple of staff at the lobby and tuktuk or else everyone is friendly. The corridors carpet is a little old and smelly at times. ",4,0.9575
"if you are looking for sleeping well in the chaos of Bangkok meanwhile enjoying the vibrant city, Radisson is certainly one of the best location that you can find in the heart of sukhumvit. The staff is very nice and helpful all the time,The swimming pool and the jacouzi are fantastic and the internet is a delight if you need to work on some report.My coffee  breaks were excellent with home made cookies.",5,0.982
"Stayed at Radisson's for 4 days. The property is really nice and affordable. Big and comfortable rooms with all the required amenities, felt flooring needed more maintenance. Ordered Indian food from room service and it was delicious. Breakfast was nice and lavish.  Tuk Tuk free service is provided by the hotel to nearby places which saved our money and time.  Pool was good but only for adults.  Saw many families staying in this property, it would be nice if they build a small play room for kids.  Would like to mention a couple names who made our stay more special.  Ms. Amp at breakfast area was very hospitable.  Ms. Nat at reception is really nice and humble.  And special thanks to the duty manager Nopparat Maneechote for placing a small birthday cake for me on my birthday. ",4,0.9899

My first stay in this property while in Bangkok. Though its about 7 to 10 mins walk to main Sukumbhit other than a very hot day I don't think is an issue. They have their Tuk Tuk service and they drop you at the corner of Soi 11. Over all a very good stay.,5,0.2716
Reasonable price hotel with good location and excellent breakfast. This was my second visit in this hotel so I already knew what to expect. So it was easy to find good restaurants nearby. Staff of this hotel is very friendly and they speak good English.,4,0.9587

"The rooms are large and clean, the breakfast ok. They offer a complementary tuktuk service to bring you to the next metro station.  Three times I asked for a favour. After my booking my son (18 years old) decided to join me, so I asked the hotel for the extra charge for the additional breakfast. They asked for 1,500 Bht (approx. 45 Euro), not for the stay but per night. As my flight was cancelled, I had to leave a day earlier and asked for a refund, in which way every. It was rejected. Than I asked, whether I could get at least a voucher for the not used breakfast, to enjoy it at an other Radisson worldwide (with NH hotel they offered me this deal without asking), but again the idea was rejected.  There are a lot of other hotels around, next time I will book there.",4,0.4587
Radisson Suites BKK is a pleasant surprise! The breakfast buffet is the best and the price is just fine with me! The daily tuk tuk shuttle around Sukhumvit is an excellent idea and I loved that service free from the Hotel ,4,0.9715

"All good, Except the Attitude of Punjab Grill-Radisson staff. Such persons should not be in the Properties like Radisson. He seems very happy of Insulting the In-room guests.

"I have stayed in at least a dozen hotels in Bangkok over the last few years, so I know many of the hotels pretty well, particularly around Sukhumvit.  I picked the Raddison Suites due to its approximately to Soi 11, which is right around the corner.  Big mistake.  This hotel is sorely in need of a renovation, the room was really shabby, with scuff marks everywhere, a sad, tired feel about the place, sort of drab and ugly furniture, a gross shower with most of the fixtures, including the drain, in need of repair.  My room was a ""suite"" meaning it has a small entry area with a crappy old sofa and a TV, but is was so unpleasant, I never even sat down in there. The bed area itself was clean, with new bedding, and the TV was functional, but other than that, it was really not a good",2,-0.9188

"I stayed in this hotel in May 2019, for an extended weekend. got a very good rate with points/cash combination, although the room was small with no view.   The location of this hotel is excellent for wondering around, it is a bit far from BKK airport though. Staff was well trained and helpful, including with city travel advise.   Restaurants and the pool side bar were good, although expensive compared to the neighbourhood bars. After trying some neighbourhood bars, i decided to stick with the one at the hotel:) though. rooms were clean, with nice welcome note from the general manager and some fruits. furniture is a bit old but the bed/matres was very good for a good night sleep!   You will find a lot of useful stuff in the room including hair dryer, iron, even a battery light. ",5,0.9746

"Really enjoyed our stay. The negative to start: the rooms are a little tired but I believe they are refurbishing them. The location is good, close to BTS Nana which helps exploring. The breakfast is extremely good with a wide variety and array. The coffee is the h st I had in Thailand but my favourite bit was the egg chef!!! The staff are the real jewel though.

The breakfast was very good, tasty and plentiful The hotel was conveniently placed in centre of Bankok Would have given 5stars if not so tired in appearance",4,0.9759
"Stayed in Radisson for 4nights with a high expectation (price is almost similar to Novotel and other similar chains) but it turned out just average.   First the location. Itâ€™s a 10mins walk from the nearest BTS station (a long stretch!) which can be quite scary if you walk alone especially at night as itâ€™s not a â€˜busyâ€™ street packed with small stalls or shops/restaurants. But THANK GOD that the hotel provides free â€˜shuttle/tuk-tukâ€™ service round trip from the BTS. That was a huge plus given the hot weather.   Second the room. The suite rooms are spacious - with living room but itâ€™s evident that the furnitures and fittings are old (the sofa looked tired and stained). Sound proof is not great as well, I can hear guests from the next room talking loudly. The pillows are also very",4,-0.3704

The room was very quiet and pleasant. The was efficient and friendly. The breakfast was very good with a good choice of salty and not salty item. The pool and the  jakusi pleasant. The perfect stayâ€™ to be recommanded for your stay in Bangkok.,5,0.9726
"Room, while clean, seems out dated. The walls and doors are thin and the noise of other doors in the hallways and showers from other rooms can be heard. Unlucky for me, I stayed on the day they had a party on the lobby floor... I stayed on the third floor, but the noise from the DJ was unbearable I could not sleep until 2am (the party lasted until 1:30 in the morning!)  I paid about USD80 for this hotel, there are presumably better hotels at this pricepoint  in BKK.   Never am I staying here again... that is for sure.",3,0.9245
"The only problem with the hotel was when we had to leave it.  We have visited BKK many times and I had another favorite hotel but the Radisson made that history.. from service to room size to facilities to food and staff the whole experience was flawless and we are always nice but very critical, I simply couldnâ€™t find anything to criticize here.  Simply an amazing experience!",5,0.8361
