"As regular visitors to the Royal Orchid Sheraton,  our most recent stay was just as pleasurable as the others.  The staff at all areas of the hotel are always friendly and helpful.  The Club staff is exceptional, never a chore to go out of their way to make your stay comfortable and enjoyable.  The hotel is always in top shape.clean and tidy.  Some services were unavailable due to the current covid-19 situation.  Hope that ends soon.  The guest rooms, always an upgrade as titanium level member is a welcome and additional joy.  Spacious and with great rooms facing the river.  Thai style accessories make the room warm and comfortable.  Spacious bathrooms and comfy beds with quality linens and pillows.  All the room amenities you could need.  From Club Lounge, to restaurants, lobby",5,0.9877
Visited this hotel for the 4th time in March .Still think this is a gem of a place in the middle of a bustling city.  To have gardens and peacocks around a beautiful pool with a swim up bar and comfortable sunbeds - especially after a long flight is delightful.  The location is still great with fantastic views of the river from your room and the outside bar and lap pool.  The boat to take you to the sky train and the river bus right next door make it so easy to get about the city.  Highly recommended.,5,0.9765
"Our family recently spent two weeks staying at the Royal Orchid Sheraton while in Thailand for the adoption of our son. We cannot possibly say enough positive things about this hotel. The staff was incredible. They were beyond friendly, went out of their way to be of support and service to us, and were extremely professional. Nimit was wonderful for our family and regularly had conversations with us and our son during our comings and goings. Another staff member made a paper airplane for our son one afternoon while we waited for dinner to be delivered. From the concierge to the front desk, from the housekeeping staff to the wait staff at breakfast, we could not have asked for more.   The breakfast was delicious and offered great variety. We ate each morning outside by the river",5,0.9682
We just finished staying here for 2 nights. Once at the beginning of our trip then 1 night at the end of our trip. We will definitely look to stay here again the next time we are in Bangkok. The value was unbeatable. As elite members we were given a club floor room. The room was very nicely appointed. Our room looked to have been updated. Nice spacious bathroom with tub and shower and had everything we needed. The floor to ceiling windows gave a gorgeous view of the river. The club lounge was also very nice and the breakfast offered was very nice with much more variety than was expected. Same with happy hour where they had a wonderful selection of food........ enough really for a full dinner if you wanted. Service was also very good. Everyone very helpful with anything we,5,0.9872
We've recently stayed at this hotel and will definitely recommend. It is perfectly located at the riverside with beautiful views across the river. The hotel is spotless and the staff are always making sure it is clean. All the staff were so helpful and always smiling! We will definitely be returning. Thank you,5,0.9825
"From the minute you enter the hotel to your check out this hotel offers all that is needed for your stay in Bangkok. The views of the river. The accessibility to their own Private boat taking you up and down the river. To the service either at their extraordinary Breakfast Buffet of many nations, or poolside. Food preparation and service all exemplary. To take the regular boats to the temples you simply walk out the front door and the alley entrance is right there. NO hassle NO fuss. This to me was a  great spot to start our 3rd. trip to Bangkok and we are never disappointed with any  facets of the Royal Orchid. Kudos to all the staff who made our stay exemplary.",5,0.6234
Really good position on the river views from rooms are spectacular. Really good boat taxi free across the river to the shopping mall. Good access to other transport. The rooms was a little shabby and in need if updating. Not a cheap hotel for food or drinks. Breakfasts good variety but you were sometimes rushed a little if you went down towards the end they finished at 10.30 but wanted you out by 10.15. It was quiet when we were there wouldn't like to go in busy times as breakfast were the only busy part we saw.,4,0.6932
"We love the SPG group but this hotel was disappointing. It has a shabby feel. We stayed on the top Executive floor. The carpets in the corridor smelled old and used. I must say, though, that the one good thing about the hotel was the Executive lounge which has a very good cocktails spread and drinks selection. The staff is very friendly and the breakfast on the Executive floor is really good.  ",4,0.95
"Nice and reasonably priced, if you're looking for a bit of a luxury without blowing the wallet. Room is spacious and has a nice river view. Icon Siam Mall right across the river is such a lovely complex, ranging from a variety of local food, to high end restaurants and luxury brands. Even if you're not a shopping buff, it's worth visiting.   The only issue with this hotel is the location. The best way to travel in/out is by taxi. The river ferry is possible too but you could wait quite long on a weekend as the frequency is slow. It's also further away from known attractions such as the shukumvit area. It's good if you want to stay at the river and plan to visit the grand palace.",4,0.965
"We stayed here as part of a Luxury Escape package. It's across the river from a shopping plaza which was handy at times.  There's a hotel ferry plus some local ferries. The room was very nice with a lovely view of the river. Staff were friendly and helpful, although some did express the opinion that being on a Luxury Escape package, we did get things free of charge. We felt obliged to inform them that we had actually paid for the package. The buffet breakfast was excellent.  Unfortunately the set menu dinner at the Thara Thong restaurant was totally the opposite.  We had a better meal at the pop up Thai restaurant acroos the road. Both pools were very good.",4,0.9782
"We really enjoyed staying at The Royal Orchid Sheraton. Our room was very comfortable and had a lovely view of the river. The hotel is adjacent to a river ferry stop so it was easy to reach many of the important sights such as the Royal Palace and Wat Arun. After sightseeing we relaxed by the pool overlooking the river... so much to see while sipping a nice cocktail or beer ! The breakfast buffet was extensive with a wide selection of Thai and Western dishes, and we could enjoy our meal on the riverfront terrace. The Thai restaurant on-site was delicious and had nightly entertainment of Thai music and dancing. All of the staff were very courteous and professional. We highly recommend this hotel and look forward to staying here again when in Bangkok ! ",5,0.9887
"Very good breakfast. Free shuttle to the other side f the river. Great views from the room. Nice staff.   - Old fashioned decorated. Some of the taxis in front of the hotel are scam. They will a ""special price"", even it is not, but you have to make a stop with them on shops were they have commission. Something like this choose other one. The door staff of the hotel should be more careful when you ask them a taxi. Concierge is good.",4,0.9247
MY Husband and I stayed here at the beginning of our holiday in Thailand. Checking in was very quick and one niggle it would  have been  to be welcomed with a drink after a long journey. But overall great location and everything clean . Great pool areas and plenty of fresh towels on hand.  We were offered an upgrade at a good price for a  club room which gave you access to the club lounge on the top floor and everyday at certain times  you were offered free drinks and food including cocktails were amazing and felt very spoilt. Overall great location and easy access for transport . Definately be back next year.,4,0.9908
"I have to confess that I'm not normally the greatest fan of Bangkok however, a stay at this hotel has changed my perception of the city entirely. Located next to the river, it provides a perfect opportunity to sit with a drink in your hand and watch the night-time hustle and bustle of party boats and light shows. The bars and restaurants belonging to the hotel are stylish and the food is very good. I can recommend Georgio's if you are a lover of Italian food and wine.  The rooms are certainly well equipped and clean. Ask for a river view if you plan to stay. You will not be disappointed.",5,0.9815
"WOW. Stayedat this hotel for a couple of nights. Terrific location. First class river views from our rooms. Service was genuinely friendly and warm. Breakfast was really good with heaps of local cuisine. Will difinetly return to this clean, friendly and warm hotel when I next visit Bangkok.",4,0.9724
"The hotel was beautiful, situated right on the river.  The property had 2 pools and a dock where they provided a courtesy water shuttle to several stops along the river.  This allowed the guest to actually pick up other courtesy water taxis to get to various attractions such as Icon and Asiatique shopping and entertainment venues.  Tuk Tuk and Taxis were readily available to take you to other parts of the city as well.",5,0.9325
"Occupied a premier room on the 24th floor. The room had an exceptional view but was small. All amenities were provided, the room was well maintained and cleaned. A big disappointment was the size of the bathroom which did not provide any space for personal items on the vanity. The large buffet breakfast provided for all tastes and appetites.",4,-0.631
"Stayed at this lovely hotel for our first 2 nights in Thailand on our 15day tour. Was great hotel, with great views, great rooms and perfect location. Staff were great and we were greeted at 8am after a long flight and taken care off brilliantly. We decided to upgrade on arrival being a member and wow, great that we did. We had breakfast for both days included, a room on the 27th floor which also allowed you to have Free drinks between 4:30-7:30 and snacks 5:30 - 7:30 which were both great and was a great addition. We had a fantastic stay and when I return to Bangkok, this will be the hotel we will stay. Right on the river for easy access to Grand Palace etc.",5,0.9964
As an old avid SPG loyalist and being the second time in Bangkok really wanted to try this hotel out for the most part because the river views looked awesome! As the days were getting nearer there were some very competitive rates in the city and almost cancelled and tried a more modern property........but I just wanted that river view! We arrived and were able to get into our room immediately - we were also upgraded to a Junior Suite I believe. A gentleman in Thai wardrobe accompanied us to our room. He was a little odd to say the least and wasn't sure what to take of him from the start. The entrance to the hotel is not really grand - it just shows up all of a sudden from a back street. It almost felt like we were entering it from a back lane or something? We entered the room,3,0.7372
This place is great. On the river across from IconSiam mall. They even have a water taxi to get you there. Our 2nd visit to this Sheraton and still completely satisfied. Pet at the front desk on the midnight shift was very helpful. Breakfast buffet offered many choices for everyone!,5,0.8904
"Stayed here for a few nights while visiting Bangkok for leisure. We stayed in a club-level room and the hotel was perfect for our visit!  We were doing all of the “touristy” things in Bangkok, and the location of this hotel to the river to catch the ferry boat is great! The hotel also has a free ferry across the river to a large shopping mall.  Our room was great, we were on a high floor the faced the river - excellent views!! The club lounge was convenient. We had the continental breakfast there each morning, and enjoyed pre-dinner cocktails there a couple times. The staff was helpful and attentive. ",5,0.9802
"We pre booked a premium deluxe room requesting an up river view. Also that the room was pre air conditioned before arrival and that ice and fresh milk were on hand. All was done perfectly. Service and check in were excellent. Buffet breakfast consistently good all mornings. Staying here really made our holiday and the good thing was that service and quality were consistent across days and staff rotations. I found the room clean,comfortable and quiet as the river boats and music closed down by 10.30 latest. A definite recommend. Sheraton are delivering their brand well here.",5,0.9796
"This was our second visit and once again we enjoyed two days in this excellent hotel. It has a wonderful waterfront location, superb rooms and is very spacious throughout. The international breakfast is extremely substantial and satisfying. The staff are very friendly, attentive and professional.",5,0.9759
"We stayed here for 3 nights and enjoyed our stay. We were in room 1022 and had beautiful view overlooking the river. The room was very large, with floor to ceiling windows. It was well lit and had reading lights. The bed was extremely comfortable. The bathroom had a large mirror that was well lit, a high bathtub with a hand held shower. But beware of scalding - the hot water is VERY hot. All amenities were provided, with a safe, huge TV having many channels, desk with light.There was a stuffed sitting chair also.  The hotel lobby and other areas were very nicely appointed. We had breakfast each day and it was a nice variety. The location is great, with free ferries to take you across the river to the large mall across the way.",5,0.9881
Stayed here one night with friends during a cruise  Bedrooms are excellent great mattresses and pillows  Fantastic view from 24th floor Beware of prices  Everything including rooms carries a 10% service charge and Tax A bottle of wine that I would pay £8 for at home in England was about £100 or £20 a glass  Service in bar and restaurant was poor with surprisingly little English spoken for a five star hotel  Over all disappointing ,3,0.875
Stayed for three nights prior to travelling back to UK. Wonderful location right by the river. Our suite had floor to ceiling windows  which allowed for great views in both directions  of all the river traffic. Many boats are lit up at night and adds to a great  evening vibe. There is a free shuttle boat that takes you to a shopping complex called Iconsiam. Shopping wise the outlets are pretty much the same as any major city but for foodies and anyone interested in buildings/ feats of engineering it is quite something. Many street vendors and food outlets are a short walk from the hotel. Our room was a little tired and the damaged flooring and iron mark in the carpet was the first thing we noticed on arrival. It did not detract from a comfortable  stay however. The bed was so,4,0.5403
"This was my second time in this amazing hotel. Royal Orchid Sheraton is one of my favorite places in Bangkok. The staff is so kind and friendly, the room is really big with the most comfortable bed ever! We had the best view looking at the river, and the breakfast was just amazing! There was plenty of food to choose, and the restaurant near the river was just beyond the words. The best lobster we ever tried! Also, there were two swimming pools, so we could choose which one do we like the most, and we had amazing time there, drinking some cocktails and enjoying the quiet time, just relaxing.  I can't wait to come back again, because this is my favorite hotel in Bangkok!",5,0.9944
"Top class hotel with a breathtaking view on Bangkok from the room and from the lounge bar. The bed in the room is very comfortable, and the whole hotel is clean. The breakfast is one of the best I have ever had in hotels, and the staff is really amazing and helpful.",5,0.97
"I stayed 5 days at the Royal Orchid Sheraton hotel Bangkok. and enjoyed every minute. The suite was spacious, comfortable and clean with a wonderful view on the Chao Phraya River. The staff at al areas is very friendly, service oriented and they really try to do their most to make you feel “at home”. WiFi availability is good at al areas. Breakfast is really good with a large variety of choices of Asian and/or Western style all being served with a very good service of a lovely smiling staff. The pool is very nice and I really liked it. The location of the hotel is excellent, it provides a beautiful view on the river and a very convenient access with the boats shuttle to nice places like the Ancor Siam mall, The grand palace, the emerald Buddha, BTS station etc. The hotel lounge",5,0.9947
"This hotel stands out among others for its advantageous location, especially thanks to a well-established river shipping company, many sights of the old city can be reached without problems.  Impeccable cleanliness, exemplary service, friendly concierge - make the hotel attractive to many individual tourists and groups.  Rooms with river views are especially attractive.  The hotel restaurant surprises with its variety of international and Thai cuisine.  A wonderful evening on the terrace overlooking the river and the brilliant shopping complex ICON SIAM",4,0.977
"Just stayed here for 6 nights. Wonderful hotel. Great location by the river with free boat to Iconsiam. Really enjoyed Club lounge and Riverview restaurant. View from room on 28th floor was great also. By far the best thing about my stay was the Garden Pool with the Peacocks. They were so entertaining to watch. Very unusual sitting on a sun lounger and all of a sudden a peacock walks past you!!! Brilliant and very unique!! The staff are all lovely and really nice too particularly in the pool bar. The service is very speedy too. Hotel room, grounds and facilities are excellent. As a solo traveler I felt completely safe the entire time here. Hotel is joined to ferry terminal so very convenient to go on evening river cruise from here. Also next door is public taxi boat that takes",5,0.9934
"The hotel is in a great location right by the river. The hotel shuttle runs every half hour across the river to the Iconsiam &amp; then down to the Skytrain Station. At the Iconsiam you can pick up the hop on hop off ferries to all the riverside attraction. Travelling on the river is probably the fastest way to get around Bangkok. The hotel itself is pleasant enough although the rooms are a little bit tired. However, all your needs are catered for toiletries, tea &amp; coffee etc. The towel are amazing really soft &amp; fluffy not like some of the thread bare ones supplied in some hotels.  My husband in Coeliac and they had gluten free cereals &amp; bread available at the breakfast buffet.  If we visited Bangkok again, which I seriously doubt I would stay at this hotel again.",4,0.8902
All rooms have wonderful river views. Excellent comfy beds. Good size rooms. Restaurants right on the river although a little pricey. Breakfast with huge choice but food was only ever luke warm. Very useful river shuttle to the Skytrain and Iconsiam shopping centre. Excellent street food at front on hotel. Easy and interesting walk to China town,4,0.9785
"We stayed at this hotel for our last night in Thailand. We wish that we would have spent a couple days in Bangkok. The hotel offers a complimentary boat shuttle to the designer mall across the river and to a major boat taxi stop. China town is a short walk - we enjoyed the street vendors and outdoor market. We didn't make it to the neighboring jewelry stores before 5pm but heard from other hotel guests that there were some good prices. The hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating they even called us a taxi for our 4am trip to the airport. The only con we have is the shower - the temperature fluctuates from burn your skin, to cold, to back to your set temperature.  But we would definitely stay here again on our next trip!",5,0.95
"Service and quality is what you would expect with Sheraton.  Situated on the river Chao Phraya and not far away from Chinatown, this hotel has a very convenient location.  Multiple places to dine and a free boat shuttle are all nice touches as was the very accommodating staff.",4,0.7269
"The hotel is beautifully situated at the shores of Chao Phraya river. It has its own quay and bout that takes you over to the new chopping centre ICONSIAM on the opposite side of the river and a little down the river to the sky train station. About one 100 meters from the hotel is the communal quay that is frequented by several boats and boat lines. This is also a small shopping centre with many antique and art dealers among others.  All the rooms have a river view due to the very smart layout of the building with only the corridor windows heading to the city. The junior suits that are on the club levels, from 17 and up, are spacious with a living room and a bedroom and places to put your clothes and other stuff. The bathroom is also pretty large with a good shower area and also",4,0.9152
"Great stay and upgrade to club level (27th floor) floor with lounge access.Free boar shuttle every 30 min to Iconic Siam Mall across the river, plenty of food options. Chinatown is walkeable from the hotel. We went to see the Golden Buddha there. Hotel food was good, the restaurant dining options looked great but we didn't get to try it. Plenty of free water, spacious rooms, comfy bed and large TV. Great river / city view from our room.",5,0.9528
We have been visited Sheraton hotel the hotel was nice and good maintained. This hotel included with two Salt Swimming pool and we would like to recommend for business group will be better. Here have complementary boat service to shopping mall &amp; BTS train station nearby. But unfortunately the hotel area is not good So Noise all day &amp; night the smelly for the river was not good. The stay period we had to early check out due to this problem and staff can not do anything to make you comfortable to stay even we informed to them twice time until we decided to early check out. Thank you to provide beautiful hotel for take a wonderful photo ,4,0.9783
"By the river Chao Phraya and not far away from Chinatown, this hotel has a very convenient location. As with many Sheraton Hotels around the world, a partial renovation would improve, but the price is right for Bangkok at it current stage. A very good option to be close to the lively river and with a complimentary shuttle river to Sapan Taksim to catch the BTS (elevated mass rail transport).",4,0.9318
"I've stayed at this particular hotel many times in the past and despite it being a bit old I've always enjoyed it. Also it hold some sentimental value to me.   However, It's just not very good anymore and next time I'll try something else (eg Shangri-la where I stayed two weeks ago which is so much better or something newer).   Since I stayed at Sheraton Orchid last time (1 year ago) it's just declined in terms of standard, service, quality etc. Overall just not a great experience. Here are few of my experiences to back up the claim:  1. Made an order through room service. After an hour nothing! I then called room service only to be told off that they had never received an order from me. Then I spoke to the manager and the order came 15 mins later. What I received was just",2,0.6761
"I've been bangkok several times but It's my first time to visit this hotel.  I liked this hotel very much.  Excellent breakfast food quality, convenient free shuttle, big shopping mall nearby, perfect riverside view and more. Also the lounge staff was very nice  and they asked me about my needs and filled them in every time. One thing I want is that official Facebook messages or official email replies are slow",5,0.9782
We've been here 4 times in the past 20 years and it is still as good as ever. Location on the river right next to a boat stop. We love travelling up and down the river on the boat busses. 15 baht each and great fun. We've stayed on the club floor every time and sipping cocktails on the 27th floor watching the sun set on the river is still a magical experience. Prices remarkably good. Two lovely swimming pools by the river.  Only negative is hotel restaurants typically expensive with bland food. But a couple of decent places just outside and taxis very cheap to get around in. ,5,0.9482
My husband and I stayed at Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel for 2 nights as a part of Luxury Escape package. It took 30 minutes from the airport.(8pm) The staff was very polite and friendly. The room was large and very comfortable. The bathroom was dated but a staff told us that they are expecting to have renovations in the near future. Hopefully they can update all the bathrooms. The dinner at Thara Thaong was very nice! The complimentary boat services were very good. We didn't use any transports on land. I wish we could have stayed a couple of more nights and spent more time around Bangkok. We would recommend Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel to our friends and family! ,5,0.9868
"We have been travelling to BKK for some 30 years and have stayed at the Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel numerous times during this time. We absolutely love being on the river and have shared many holidays with family and friends here, as well as travelling just as a couple.   The old staff are always welcoming and genuinely interested in how you have been.  However, we have never witnessed such a steady decline in service as this hotel has over the past five or so years. We used to receive a personal letter from the Manager welcoming us “home” - gone. We used to receive a fruit bowl with lovely tropical fruit - gone.  In May last year we received 2 apples and in December 3 bananas! We used to receive a certain amount of complimentary laundry each day - gone. Children weren't allowed",3,0.9838
"This hotel gives the Sheraton brand a bad name, disgusting service from the front desk staff, i had booked a room facing the river side on New years eve through a third party website with a pay at hotel option, at first the hotel did not want to honor the booking and said they were fully booked even though we had a confirmed booking and then finally after the third party website pushed them they gave us the room and charged me the full price immediately, even though it was supposed to be payed at the hotel in local currency on the day of check in, i called the hotel and talked to the manager who said they can do what they want as its the third party website's fault to mention that its cancellable and pay at hotel, as i had already planned to stay i didn't make an issue about it",1,-0.8004
Had a two night stay at the Sheraton. The room was clean and modern while the view of the riverside was simply awesome. Sat at night simply watching the world go by and then realising I simply must get some sleep !!! Staff were amazing and helpful. Breakfast buffet was very good with lots of variety. We ate late on arrival at the lounge bar on the ground floor and the food was averagely priced as well as the drinks for such a high class hotel. The grounds were very nice and although being in central downtown Bangkok the swimming pool Area and gardens are a oasis of calm and relaxation. We had a great stay also the shuttle boat is handy every half hour to cross the river to the Siam shopping centre and then onward to the nearest sky train station. The hotel is also conveniently,5,0.9855
"Wouldn't hesitate to stay here next time in Bangkok. View of the river is great always something to watch. One side of the hotel is the river taxi pier. The hotel has it's own free courtesy launch every half hour from 10.00 am which takes you across the river to the very large new shopping centre Icon Siam (great food stalls in the lower level) and to the nearest metro station. The sound,light and water show outside the Icon Siam in the evening is brilliant and free.",5,0.9486
"We have travelled to Bangkok numerous times and habe stayed in many of Bangkoks 5 Star Hotels such as Shangri La, Peninsula, different Anantara Hotels etc. Having stayed at the Sheraton for three nights we have to conclude that this hotel cannot be claiming 5 Stars compared to what other Bangkok hotels have to offer. The Sheraton seems to cater mainly for Chinese Tour Groups, thus the guests are not in a 5 Star range. The hotel ambiance is overall middleclass, lobby more a Tourist-Mall ambiance, rooms and public areas are worn and shabby, so are the pool areas. Do not get me wrong: If you are expecting a 3.5 Star hotel you will be happy, but if you have ever experienced true 5 Star hospitality in one of the many truely fabulous Bangkok hotels you will end up very disaoppointed.",3,0.8974
"The Royal Orchard Sheraton delivers everything you would expect from an international chain. Large room, comfortable bed and good service.  The breakfast is a huge international buffet and can be enjoyed outside on the terrace or inside.  There are 2 pools, good for cooling off after a day's sightseeing.  The hotel is walking distance from Chinatown and next door to a jetty where the river taxis stop so easy access to the main old city sites and also the leisure complex downstream.  The hotel has a free shuttle service linking it, the shopping mall IconSiam and the BTS station. An e all rooms have a river view, river taxis and long tail boats during the day and the brightly lit party boats at night. I got a special deal which made it worth staying in a 5 star hotel but the best",5,0.966
"The Royal Orchid Sheraton boasts of great views over the river, proximity to the boat pier, and a fantastic selection of fruits.  Unfortunately, the check-in at the lounge (for Bonvoy guests) takes a long time (I prefer speedier 2-minute check-ins at reception), and there is a lot of noise at night from outside that gets into my room, but management informed me that they're renovating the hotel to reduce the noise.",4,0.4854
"Last time I was here was almost 15 years ago and I remembered the luxurious rooms and facilities. Now I'm back again and the rooms are very well kept, the pools are awesome,i think there's one new one since I was here last time. They now have one fresh water pool and one salt water pool. The fresh water pool is full of kids and flies as there's no wind here, but the saltwater pool has neither and is a great tranquil place to be. Sound proofing in the room isn't the best so if you're a light sleeper and want to sleep in you might be woken up in the morning. Hotel staff is awesome, except for the lack of smiles in the bar downstairs they all were very smiling and service minded. I would give the hotel a full score if it hadn't been for my shower being moody, it changed between",4,0.4927
Enjoyed another great holiday at this hotel stayed in club rooms that had great views and club lounge was excellent there is now a new shopping mall ICOMSIAM opposite the river that is easily reached with free hotel boat,5,0.975
"I enjoyed our stay at this hotel.  The rooms are medium sized and comfortable, although the bathrooms are a little dated.  The views of the Chao Phraya river are outstanding with floor to ceiling windows.  Breakfast was excellent, although crowded at times.  The free shuttle across the river to the shopping malls is a nice touch.",5,0.9657
"Great room with lovely view of the river. Easy free shuttle to mall across the river. Wonderful breakfast buffet.  Terrific spa experience!  Had dinner in both the Italian and Thai restaurants in the hotel-both great food.  In the Thai restaurant, Thara Thong,   we were served by Ms. Weraya and Ms. Ratea, who were a great help in arranging a special birthday surprise",5,0.989
"Stayed here on a number of occasions. Great location, right on the river with a complimentary hotel boat service. Staff are so friendly, helpful and polite. Rooms are large (most have river views), clean and well presented. All the features you'd expect of a 5 star hotel - cable TV, king bed, safe, bar fridge etc. 2x outdoor pools to choose from and the food in the restaurants is of a high standard. The breakfast buffet especially is excellent. Best hotel in Bangkok..",5,0.9844
"We stayed 9 days in January, 2020 and thoroughly enjoyed it. The service is excellent. The spa there is top notch. You can definitely find cheaper massages, but it depends on the experience you want. Our massages were peaceful, fully private, luxurious—worth it to be pampered. Room service was excellent as well, good choice of Western and Thai food for kids. Food is good with lots of choices for restaurants and reasonably priced. The pools are okay—it's a city hotel so there's not room for sprawling pools.   There is one negative, but it's not just this hotel. The Riverside area hosts dinner cruise ships and the music can be heard even on the 27th floor until about 10:30. But again, it's a city hotel in a city famous for its nightlife.   The river view was stunning-to see each",5,0.9682
"Nice hotel right on the river. Great views,room was very nice perfect for city break not really the kind of hotel you hang around in. Got the usual upgrade for x price add breakfast for x price. Didn't bother with either.  The location of the hotel worked out great. Not in the middle of all the night life but been on the river made us make use of the water taxi and that was one of my favourite parts of the trip. It's such a crazy place. In a good way",4,0.8957
"The Royal Orchid Sheraton has comfortable rooms, most of which look out on the Chao Phraya and over to Longsan Plaza and Iconsiam. You can get the free Iconsiam, or hotel, shuttle across to the plaza. It is also very handy for the expressboat which, at ฿15/head each way, will get you up the orange line to the old-city stop at Tha Chang (Pier 9) for the Grand Palace, Wat Phra Kaeo, Wat Pho and the National Museum or Pier 8 for Wat Arun. The breakfasts are great and we had exemplary service from the concierge, especially Boonmee Tangwong and his collegaues, who both guided us and organised our return taxi to Suvarnabhumi for ฿500 (around £14); this included the toll surcharge. Nice hotel with great WiFi but could be a bit noisy at night from its convention centre's function rooms.",4,0.8248
"We were very comfortable at this hotel, but what made our stay particularly enjoyable was the friendly and helpful concierge. In particular, Mr. Sothon went the extra mile to help us, beyond what we expected any hotel's concierge staff to do. We are so grateful to him! ",5,0.977
"So my husband and I have stayed at the Sheraton twice before and were really happy with the service and facilities. But this time we were really dissatisfied with the room we were allocated. On the 19th floor. When I booked the holiday I paid extra to be upgraded to a deluxe river view like the previous two times. However apparently we had been upgraded again? The photos attached will show that I'd hate to think what the basic rooms are like. First off it's so unbelievably dated and lacks any attentions to details. The curtains are all creased and don't meet in the middle , and we have a horrible shower curtain!! Is it the 90's? We've been offered another room on the 22nd floor which is exactly the same but the view is worse. I honestly cannot believe this is a 5 star hotel!",2,0.3369
"I stayed at the Royal Orchid Sheraton for 6 nights. It as at the end of a long trip in Southeast Asia so we splurged and booked a club floor room and it was well worth it. We had fabulous river views from our rooms and from the club. There are several good restaurants to choose from, a lovely swimming pool and spa. Staff is well-trained and very helpful. Hotel provides convenient boat ferry to other side of river.",5,0.945
"Just returned from a 2 night stay here. The hotel location is amazing and the river views are incredible.  They couldn't find my booking with expedia which made the check-in very stresfull, but the reception managed to get us a room. The rooms are a great size, but not very nice interior. Old dated colors and you had to pay extra for two single beds which I have never experienced before.  Breakfest was great, but a lot of people. Pool area was lovely with the sweetest staff serving the bar area. The guys outside the hotel was almost the best thing about the hote. They were amazing with taxis and generel tips, and I used them a lot. The hotel is very big and a tiny bit too central station-ish. I am aware that I booked a huge international hotel myself, but the inside traffic was",3,0.9855
"Very good lunch buffet, many varieties. Sheraton is one of my favorite hotels. I must say that their services are very good everywhere but I don't know why in this hotel the staff doesn't talk at all to the guests. Need more costumer care, this is my opinion, anyway I will go back. The place is good ",5,0.9349
"This hotel was great. Courteous staff who always greeted and anticipated all our needs. Great restaurants (we ate the in Thai restaurant once and in the River side Grill twice) which won't break the bank and still served great food. They have a free ferry from the Hotel and IconSiam which is just across the hotel. Nice large rooms (we got the ones with 2 large beds - we got 2 rooms for 4 nights) The only let down, was at the end, when we were leaving and going into our van to the airport, we were left on our own to fend for our bags even when there were 3 bellhops doing nothing in the front door (which was the total opposite of our experience when we arrived) Don't get me wrong, we were willing and able to carry our bags on our own, but when the service was excellent from the",5,0.9597

First of all we went for check in and have to waited for 2 hours because of we were book as a river king then the manager provided us a different floor from 6 to 20 floors. Which the room wasn't ready. We were disappointed because when we booked we request river king. But at the end we got the room with a nice view.  The room was large and the shower water didn't have much pressure on.   We tried to access to the club lounge in the evening for a drink but unfortunately it was full no where to sit. It is pointless to pay for the club lounge. The recommendations is club lounge should be bigger for the side of the hotel and the amount of guest.   The",4,-0.7757

"Stayed here for two nights in Bangkok after 12 day traveling through Southeast Asia.  Centrally located near many restaurants and shopping opportunities.  Staff friendly, rooms large and clean and staff gladly arrange airport transportation for you. Beautiful views.  Also very convenient to 7-eleven.  Highly recommend if you are going to Bangkok.",5,0.9485

"This hotel is quite a bit away from anything that you'd describe as a lively neighbourhood, but it has fantastic views over the Chao Phraya river, and two delightfully large pools, one of which is in an actual garden setting. The rooms are spacious, and clean, WiFi is working flawlessly and is included in the room rate. The bedding is superb, as you'd expect in a Sheraton. We slept wonderfully. Did I mention the pools? While we were there the breakfast was offered at a 50% off special, which we grabbed and didn't regret. Honestly, I don't think it was worth more than the 50% off rate, so I wouldn't recommend you pay the full fare.   There's close-by a ferry stop, and you can cross to a luxury shopping centre across the river, free of charge, boats coming in at frequent",4,0.9885
"Maybe three stars, but after an insulting email request for more money, maybe one-and-a half!  THE GOOD:  The Sheraton is a mid-range hotel located with an enviable position facing the Chao Phraya in Bangkok.  Most rooms have a nice view of the river.  The hotel has two pools, most notably, the “Garden Pool” which is an oasis in the midst of this frenetic city.  Much to the hotel's good fortune, it is located directly across the river from Bangkok's newest mega-mall, the ICONSiam.  Quite a destination!  The hotel provides boat service to the ICON twice hourly.  (For a quicker journey, walk next door to the River City Pier and grab a free ICONSiam boat which departs and returns every fifteen minutes.)  THE BAD:  We are Marriott BONVoY platinum elite members (which is basically",2,0.8307
The Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel is a very good hotel with a beautiful view of Chao Phraya river from our room. Best spot in Bangkok to relax while viewing the river with boats passing by specially at night with colorful lights. The boat shuttle to Iconsiam is free. The staff at the reception were all very helpful and will assist you in anything you need to know. Staff are very accommodating. Breakfast buffet are excellent. Hotel location is better than the sheraton at Sukhomvit area because of the view.,4,0.9802
"I have stayed here 7 or 8 time maybe more... in Bangkok probably twice that number if not more.  Most of the time I have stayed on Sukhomvit, which is convenient to business, shopping and Bumrungrad Hospital and am guilty of being loyal to Intercontinental, Starwood and Marriott Hotels...considered the best by most standards...  Having said that, I fell in love with the Sheraton Royal Orchid because of its amenities and location, strategically located at the curve of the river. It has the best location on the Chao Phraya river in terms of views second to none. I know this because i know where the other hotels are (Millennium, Hilton, Shangri-La etc)...none can match this view.  Now that the new mall Iconsiam has opened across the river, which is the highest rated mall in Asia,",5,0.9349
"Stayed here over Christmas. The location is fantastic, right on the river.  But that comes with the noise of party boats so feta high floor if that concerns you.  Staff very friendly and helpful.  However this large property is showing its age. Pool and poolside area are tired. The interior of the hotel is mostly browns, oranges and beige. Some internal jewellers and empty shops etc. Room furniture is chunky, bathrooms a bit dark and small. The external furniture is worn rattan. “Feast” restaurant menu fairly generic.  Very few ramps for pushchairs.",4,0.788
The Royal Orchid is an excellent hotel with excellent accommodations and service. Beautiful river views from the rooms make this an ideal location. Club members are especially well treated and the club room staff is particularly helpful.  One needs to be cautious when booking taxi service to the airport. Excellent buffet which has outdoor seating.,5,0.9735
"Bangkok can be jarring and having this wonderful room to come back to after a day out was a delight. Clean, air con worked great and every room has a view of the bustling river. The terrace pool area was so relaxing and great to cool down in the heat. Staff were so helpful and I received excellent service.   Location: The MRT and BTS are not right there but I did take the MRT to Hua Lamphong and took a tuk tuk/ taxi to the hotel. Both charged me 100 baht which maybe was too much for a short distance but it got me to the front door.   Once I arrived, I learned the hotel has a complimentary water bus taxi to Saphan Taksin BTS station every half hour. The BTS has a one day unlimited card for $120 baht and you can get around the city easily. The Grab app also worked well but traffic",5,0.976

Hotel is in front of river with good access to IconSiam (new shopping mall) across the river. We arranged for a dinner cruise which  leaves from a pier next to Sheraton so no need to pay extra for pick up service. Hotel is also located next door to a shopping mall with variety of restaurants. We look forward to coming back!",4,0.8914
"We stayed here in 2019-12, 23rd Floor. View to the river is amazing, breakfast is really good (Also for vegetarians), the bed was Ok and the room was clean. Location is great as well, since you can take the free hotel-boat-shuttle to the Saphan-Taksin pier, where you can hop on the skytrain which connects to down to and more. But (!) be careful at this pier. On our first day, we get of the hotel- shuttle there and got approached by a guy in a decent looking shirt, introducing himself as a security of the sheraton on his way to his wife at the hospital.

He recommended us another place, which turns out to be a total scam to make us buy shiny looking clothes in an",4,0.9564

Traffic is bad in Bangkok so take the advantage of their river bus, so convenience, fast and cheap, really don't know how people in Bangkok can afford their fare of sky train. If you want to go China Town's night market, I high recommended to take the public boats that's only 15B from the hotel &amp; the pier is on the left side, you can stay away from the traffic.",5,0.9718

Hotel porter called for a taxi and negotiated with the driver for THB500 (going to BKK). Taxi driver confirmed THB500 with receipt. (For official trips, you need receipts to refund. Got to the airport and taxi driver charged us THB700 + no receipt! So be careful with cab drivers! Also with hotel porters negotiating with cab drivers.You don't know if they're part of the commissioning scheme.",4,0.8768
"If I thought any harder about it, I still could not find a thing to complain about this hotel.  I had very friendly service, a room with a fantastic view (although every room does have river views) lots of in-house restaurants and enough others nearby too. My biggest thanks needs to go to the housekeeping staff; my room was always cleaned early in the day, which I appreciate when on vacation because I come back to my room several times a day, and very tired from jetlag.  I spent a lot of time relaxing at the garden pool, too, and enjoyed when the peacocks decided to stroll along the deck.  It was all such a great impression on me, which definitely makes a vacation memorable. ",5,0.969

The location of the hotel was convenient. It was a great experience and we would definitely stay again.",5,0.9883

The rooms are very comfortable, the breakfast buffet is huge and wonderful and the staff are superb. The concierge and staff are patient and helpful. As just one amazing example, I forgot a zipsak of clothes in a drawer in the hotel. When I got home I assumed it had been stolen from my bag at the airport. Then a week later I remembered putting the bag in the drawer in this hotel. I called housekeeping directly.

Opposite of the hotel there's huge shopping mall where you can go with free shuttle boat. Hotel is old but still looking great and all the staff was great, I can recommend this hotel.",5,0.9809
"The rooms are exactly what you expect. Maybe they are a little tired due to age.  The location is amazing and having access to the Sheraton water shuttle was a huge benefit. Having the Icon Siam across the way meant we were going back and forth quite a lot. As you would expect, the staff were delightful.",5,0.8832
"We were extremely fortunate to be upgraded to a junior suite. The room was amazing and immaculate and the view over the river was spectacular. The buffet breakfast was very busy, not surprising given the size of the hotel, but there was ample seating available and the quality and range of food was first class. being right on the river it was relatively easy to get to most of the major tourist attractions.

"I spent two weeks traveling around Southeast Asia for my honeymoon and started off the trip at the Royal Orchid in Bangkok. Great location for everything we wanted to do. Being right on the river we primarily used the ferry, which gave us easy and quick access to most places we went (Grand Palace, Wat Pho, Wat Arun &amp; Khao San Road). We found that the ferry system was actually much easier and cheaper than using a taxi or Tuk Tuk. The floating market tour we did left directly from the hotel and our trips to the weekend market and Chinatown were quick Tuk Tuk &amp; subway.  The room was a good size, modern and clean. The staff was very nice.   There are two things keeping me from giving this hotel a 5 star rating. 1.) The restaurants at the hotel are okay/average, but charge as if they",4,0.8734

Location: Love it. I know it's not on the BTS, but the boats are frequent, and it makes it a bit quieter. The Icon Siam is 10 minutes away and WOW it is AMAZING. We could access literally everything we needed around the hotel (this was important when my son got sick!).  Room: The sheets here are the BEST, and the pillows (all different kinds, loads of them).

Usually in Bangkok the service is terrific and I am always pleased with the nice smile. That was not the case this time. My receptionist named Krungkanok was very unkind with me and treated me very poorly with an attitude. I don't know what I did to deserve this. When she asked for a large amount for a deposit she seemed to think I was negotiating with her and automatically discounted the deposit. I just wanted to know why the price was so much, in the end the amount doesn't matter.   When I go to the room it was so old and worn out I was depressed.

The breakfast buffet was the best and most extensive we have ever experienced on our trips.  Very near at the hotel is the ""Si Praya"" pier for the express boat. Tickets for the boat are very cheap and you can get fast to the Grand Palace or to china town or other places. The hotel has also an own pier for the shuttle boat to the Iconsiam shopping center across the river which is surely worth a visit.  We enjoyed our stay very much.",5,0.9893

The central location is only a 5 minute walk to China town, one of Bangkok's real highlights.  We asked for and were given high rooms in quiet non smoking locations.  On the last night we treated ourselves to the buffet dinner, what a treat indeed.  An amazing selection of salad, meat, fish, sushi, pasta and local cuisine, all prepared and cooked to perfection.  The pudding and fruit was as impressive.  ",5,0.9873

The room was a good size, they upgraded on arrival (I'm a basic member which I recommend to add yourself prior to staying)  Only comment I would make is it's a little dated, but still clean, you can't expect a hotel to replace carpets and decor regularly without price hike so I do understand why, but just a comment for people who want to stay here.
