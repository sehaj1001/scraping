"Went across the street from our New Siam II Guest House to Riva Surya Bangkok for dinner.  Sat out on the deck next to the river. Drinks were two for  one. For dinner I had the Gai Phad Med Mamuang wok fried chicken with cashew nuts, onions, mixed capsicum, dried chili, shitake mushrooms and spring onion. My spouse had the Tom Kha Gai with  chicken, lemon grass, mushrooms and coconut milk. For dessert we shared a sinful Chocolate Waffle with ice cream on top. Fantastic dinner and great view of river and sunset.",4,0.6908

Have the last decennia stayed in quite a few hotels in Bangkok and the Riva Surya has my preference now because of: the rather small scale of the hotel, not too many floors, better feeling in case something ever should happen ...

"This is a lovely hotel. The rooms are large and the bed one of the most comfortable on our vacation. The staff is wonderful and friendly. Loved the pool and the service was, for the most part, very good when lounging there. Sometimes, I assume it was during the staff change, we would be forgotten about and would have to get up to get another drink or more food but that is my only complaint. I did not eat breakfast but my husband did and liked it. The major sites are just a few stops away via the boat since the hotel is on the river. Very convenient. Would definitely stay here again.",5,0.9362
"We just spent 2 nights at Riva Suraya. The hotel is in a great location, immediate access to the river buses. Rooms are of a very high standard with a great pool and terrace. The entire staff went the extra mile and were very helpful throughout our brief stay. Good buffet breakfast, something for all. We ate in the hotel restaurant, which was also very good. Nearby is a market with a number of restaurants/stalls/street food options, also worth a visit to watch everyday life.  When we are next in Bangkok I would definitely stay here again.",4,0.9694
"Hotel was clean with happy staff always willing to help.They need sanitiser beside the downstairs  guest computer though,and cleaning the keyboard is important too. Service was great as expected and received from previous visits over the years.You were greeted everyday with smiles.The hotel was very quiet as expected at this time,but staff were always present to help with everything.The Gym is quite good with aircon and towels and sanitiser.The food is expensive here but we ate out everyday so this didn,t effect us much. All rooms had safes that worked unlike some hotels we stayed in other parts of Thailand.Beds are huge and very comfy on the firm side. River view rooms are a must,watching life go by each day is great.",5,0.9609
Great location view and facilities.  The front desk was excellent and very accommodating.  The rooms and bed comfort was also a 5 in my book.  Where they slipped was with the quality and timeliness of service at the pool and restaurant.  Fix that and they would be a 5!,4,0.8908
My husband and I stayed for 3 nights during our honeymoon trip in Thailand. The service was impeccable. We had to change our flight home and they seamlessly extended our stay and kept us in the same room. The room was a perfect place to relax before or after a long day of walking. Easy to walk to the palace and temples along with being close to Khaosan road. Highly recommend!,5,0.9115
"Staff was very friendly.  Had a small issue with our room on arrival but it was handled immediately and to our satisfaction.  Definitely get a room with river view.  Clean.  Good location.  Buffett breakfast very good, enjoyed outdoor dining on river.",5,0.9803
"Great value for the price! Food is great, staff are very friendly! Nice pool and views. The bed and furniture is comfortable! No complaints. Close to good restaurants, bars and shops! We enjoyed the buffet style breakfast here! This place is fancier than I expected!",5,0.9748
"Good location, nice pool and views with a decent price. Staff were really nice. Get a river view room as it can be quite noisy near main road. But I would recommend staying here for a couple of nights",4,0.8405
"A friend of mine stayed here a year ago and recommend this hotel. Was a great place to stay. Very convenient to all the action, but yet it was quiet. The River view is also really nice from pool/Restauant area.  The staff was super nice and courteous. The service at the restaurant and bar area is pretty slow but this may be part of the culture in Thailand. Seemed lined everywhere we went they would beg you to come in for food or drinks and then it was difficult to get any service at all. FYI if you know what you want (like a beer) just order it when they seat you and don’t wait for a menu because it may be a while if you are thirsty.  Hotel was very safe and clean.  Airport shuttle - the hotel offers and it is a bit more expensive but in my opinion it is worth it. Nice clean car",5,0.9938
beautiful boutique hotel at a reasonable price within walking distance to Khoa San rd. grand palace on right on the river.  Staff were amazing.  Rooms were spacious and the few from our riverview balcony room was wonderful.   Food in the restaurant was great (especially Happy hour)  Staff were great..  ,5,0.9726
"Excellent location on the river and close to Khao San Road and lots of places to eat. Super rooms with great river views.  Lovely, friendly staff and the food in the hotel was delicious. Calm and relaxation in Bangkok.",5,0.9819
"Very good location, big room with river view, only flaw was that the room was always moist and cloths got moist as well and never got change to dry out, and it was a little expensive compared to other similar hotels",4,0.6478
Our second time at this river front hotel with no regrets. Excellent location on the river close to the Royal Palace and Khao San Road and many good restaurants. The decoration is simple with no frills but its very clean and service is always excellent. Breakfasts are still outstanding with multiple choices. And pool area is a real plus. A sure bet far from the maddening crowd of the downtown area.,5,0.9386
We found this very comfortable and smooth hotel in river Chao Praya. Lovely atmosphere and nice staff. Great river view. A bit expensive restaurant but so many cheap choices near. The staff helps you with taxes even when we visited to enjoy the Thailand symphony orchestra.,5,0.9418
"We spend 3 days at this nice Hotel on the banks of the Chao Phaya River. The room is big and well furnished and decorated. Nice view to the river,but quiet. Close access to the main and beautiful temples and palaces. Breakfast as well as thai dishes are excellent and the staff is very helpfull.",5,0.9505
"Stayed here for a night for an anniversary. Fantastic boutique-style hotel. Wonderful service start to finish. Room was spacious and clean. Wifi great. The bed was very comfortable and clean. The bathroom and shower likewise were great. Overall, woul recommend this to anyone who wants a riverside getaway that isn't too far from hotspots like Khaosan. The location was equally excellent with cafes and local restaurants within walking distance.",5,0.9863
"We stayed at this Hotel as a stopover from Australia back to UK and stayed 3 nights. On arrival, the staff were very helpful, gave us bottle of water, the booking in was quick and we were soon in our room with cases delivered shortly after.  Our room was on 5th floor overlooking Main Street. The room was adequate for both of us with complimentary water. The air conditioning was good and not noisy.  Breakfast was good with a fair choice of both hot and cold food. In the evening we ate here every night, the menu was varied and not too costly. Happy hour is 6-7 pm each evening, buy 1 get 1 free and there was a choice of drinks to have. The staff in the bar/restaurant we could not fault, they all went out of their way to accommodate you. The staff, Tony, Aum, barman and the girls",4,0.9543
"We had an excellent time at the River Surya. The best part of the stay was the friendliness and warmth of welcome from the staff - thank you. Nice room overlooking the river - some noise from the dinner boats, but they were gone by 21:00 each night so it was not a disturbance. A good restaurant on site, but also lots of places to eat a short walk away. Very nice seating by the pool - an excellent spot to watch the boats go by and general activity on the river. Close to Pier 13 for transport on the river to the rest of the city.",5,0.9659
"The welcome we received here was extraordinary and the pool and restaurant/bar on the river made an excellent place to shelter during the hottest part of the day. We loved watching the ferries and barges go up and down the river, and it was an easy walk to the bustling restaurant area and also feasible for an evening walk to see the palace lit up at night. ",5,0.926
"Great hotel to retreat from busy Bangkok, super location close to national landmarks, public transport and wide choice of bars and restaurants. Rooms are spacious and modern, staff very kind and supportive, and nice pool area. They even remembered to send me a Bday card, a week after my departure.",5,0.9569
"All was superior, just that the rooms seems to be smaller than expected. There was a nice patio and a pool with view of the river and Bangkok. Food at the restaurant was a also good. The staff was super friendly, polite and and helpful.",4,0.959
This was our first trip to Thailand and the lovely staff made us feel welcome and at home. The hotel is well located for exploring the local area.  The museums around the Siriraj hospital just across the river were worth a visit and exploring and eating out in the local alleys was goof value and fun,4,0.9382
I visited the hotel with my family and we had an amazing time!! The staff was very friendly and helpful. They were constantly offering help and asking how our day went. The breakfast was also really good and the food and drinks as well. I strongly recommend this hotel.,5,0.9703
"Enjoyed three nights at this conveniently located boutique hotel. The room was great with a nice patio and view of the river and Bangkok. The fitness center was spacious and well air conditioned! The pool area is nice, except smoking section dominates a large area.",4,0.9493
"This is a most welcome retreat in the old part of Bangkok. Cool quiet and comfortable and with the most pleasant front of house staff almost anywhere. I thought perhaps this hotel would reach my five stars of the Hanoi Hilton. But although I would say the rooms are more generous and the reception and help from the reception was as good, the breakfast and the dining staff were a disappointment. They often seemed somewhat disorganised and on one morning it was clear my order for a poached egg had not been transmitted to the chef.",4,0.9689
"This was our first time in Bangkok and the Riva Surya was recommended by our travel agent. We prefer to stay in smaller upmarket hotels, so the Riva was exactly what we were looking for. The location is directly on the river front and we had a great view. It was very easy to take the hop-on hop-off river boats to get to the Grand Palace and other sites. Very nice river side bar and pool. Rooms are modern and well equipped, excellent breakfast, you can sit outside, friendly service. Recommended!",5,0.9758
"Great, pretty hotel; wonderful hospitality.  Good breakfast; delicious dinners on the patio on the river.  Nice river walk right out back; fun market across the street.  Pretty pool.  Easy to relax at the end of a day of touring Bangkok.  Highly recommend.",5,0.9877
lovely hotel on a busy road- don't be put off by first impressions as you drive along the approach road where some of the surrounding properties are not the best quality- this is an excellent hotel ! porter is very friendly-ladies on reception are superb and cannot do enough to help- waiters are very helpful &amp; attentive-bedroom maids are welcoming-pool area is tidy and comfortable-breakfast is good quality with a wide range of European &amp; Asian options available- dinner good quality you are literally 2 minutes away from khoa san road (which you must visit!)- but the big plus is you are also only 2 minutes away from the river boat terminal which is ideal for getting in to this big city and is the best way to arrive at several tourist destinations- for 60baht (£1-50) per trip it is,5,0.9
"Family of 4 had a relaxing respite from the bustle of the city.  Great pool, attentive service, comfortable rooms and reasonable price.  YAJI was very helpful and accommodating in the restaurant, and the doormen helped out many ways.",5,0.9286
"My wife and I were ending a 3 week trip to SE Asia in Bangkok which is a big and busy city. This was a wonderful place to end our stay, on the river and is off the street and next to the river making it a peaceful location, which is also close to the old town activities and sights. Overall great accommodations, service, helpful and friendly staff, and location.",5,0.9517
"My husband and I stayed here for two nights before traveling north to Chiang Mai. The hotel was clean, quiet, great location for walking to Khoasan Road. The hotel transfer to the airport was expensive, but convenient for first time in Asia arriving at midnight. I would definitely stay here again.",5,0.7876
"Our 3 Rd stay here and as good as ever. Very clean, great service and a fantastic location near the kaosan road and the ferry boat stop means easy to get around and enjoyable for walking out in the evenings. ",5,0.955
Their are bigger hotels and more luxurious hotels... But surely none can be so welcoming and enjoyable as Riva Surya. Food and drink choices are excellent and really great value.  Rooms are large and comfortable with lovely soft touches and the river views are fantastic.   I've been a fan of this hotel and it's sister Riva Arun since they opened and would highly recommend either to anyone.  Absolutely excellent.,5,0.9906
"Together with 25 other Anglo Thai Society members, my wife and myself are nearing the end of a short (2 nights) stay at the Riva Surya Hotel which is perched on the banks of the Chaopraya River.  In common with many other Thai Hotels, the staff are most welcoming and always prepared to go the extra mile. Rooms are a good size and well equipped - try to get a river facing one if at all possible! The buffet breakfasts are excellent and my only gripe (if it amounts to such) is that the housekeeping can be a little on the slow side!  All in all, however, this is good property offering excellent value for money - somewhere I would gladly recommend to others.",4,0.9783
Myself and my partner had a lovely stay at Riva. As soon as we arrived at the hotel we were greeted with cold towels and a refreshing tea drink which was much needed. The hotel is the perfect location for visiting all the local sites inc Khao San Road. There is a port a short walk down from the hotel where you can buy tickets for the hop on ferry which takes you to all different locations along the river for a reasonable price 😊 overall we loved staying at Riva and it definitely made a mark on our 3 week trip in Thailand. ,5,0.9451
"We had a wonderful room with a balcony overlooking the river. The hotel,swimming pool and restaurant were all excellent making it a memorable stay and the staff could not have been more helpful and friendly The only thing that I would like to suggest would be a daily update on the front desk as to whether the Palace is open and what times. We tried to visit twice on 2 consecutive days and found that on both  occasions it only opened at 12 noon(we arrived at 9 am on both days) as there were religuous celebrations taking place. I totally accept that it is not your responsibility but it would be incredibly helpful for tourists staying at your lovely hotel as the Palace is probably the most popular tourist attraction.",5,0.9827
"A great option if wanting to stay around the more Thai parts of Bangkok and looking for a more upscale experience. I was upgraded so the room was not only luxurious, but very spacious, and with a river-facing balcony",5,0.3716
"Very good quiet hotel close to heritage's sites , breakfast face to theChao Praya river .  There s a small pool outside face to the river. Hotel built mainly with wood with only 5 floors. A lot of typical thai dishes but alson burger.",4,0.2724
"I had to fly to Bangkok on business from Phuket, just one night. Luckily my meeting was in the general area of the Surya Bangkok.  It was highly recommended from a fellow Hotelier.  And he was right, what a hidden little gem.  Besides it's location (I like old Bangkok better than the bustling Sukhumivt area where I usually have to overnight) and this is a true little Boutique hotel.  I just regretted my family was not with me but rest assured, I will be back bringing them with me. Due to time constraints, I had no time to check out the F&amp;B delights (great river view from the restaurant) but we'll do next time. What was the greatest asset in that hotel is THE STAFF, they all are cross trained, they all help each other, they are super friendly and always at hand for the guests. ",5,0.9902
"From the moment we arrived - 4 adults and 2 very tired young children with loads of luggage we were greeted warmly and assisted to our rooms. Once settled in we really enjoyed our three night stay.  Although we frequently stop in Bangkok a few times a year, we haven't stayed at the Riva Surya. We were very impressed with this small boutique establishment. The staff make the hotel - they are friendly, ready to help and you can see that they take great pride in working in and maintaining the hotel.   The rooms are well appointed and the beds super comfortable - only comment I would make is that the pillows could be a much better quality. The public areas are kept clean and tidy and although you might think that the pool area is small it was never crowded while we were there even",5,0.9874
"We thoroughly enjoyed Riva Surya. The front desk staff was exceptionally nice, greeting us each day and helping us with travel.  Aun was frequently our server at the restaurant where we enjoyed the breakfast buffet each day, and his hospitality made our visit special.  The location is ideal for not only dipping over to Khao San Rd. but also for visiting Chinatown, the flower market, temples and more. The Phra Arthit pier with a hop on hop off boat is right next door and makes travel nearly anywhere immensely simple for 200 baht all day.  I can't think of a single thing Riva Surya could have done or offered to make our trip better.",5,0.9335
I stayed here 2 nights and I really enjoyed my staying. First this hotel has nice pool&amp;bar. I liked watermelon juice hahaha. The pool&amp;bar has very nice river view. And this hotel is close to local popular restaurants. Khungdae and Naisoei. Also very close to Khason street. Staffs were kind and gentle. I can say that when I go back to Bangkok I will stay at this hotel.,5,0.9741
"We chose this hotel basically because of the location. Instead of staying in the business district which offers a wide range of new hotels, we preferred to stay in the old town and by the river. This hotel is just by the river Surya and at walking distance to many tourist attractions, including the popular Khaosan road.   The taxi from the airport costs around 450 Bahts including tools and surcharge. The driver wanted to charge us 600 Bahts but we insisted to use the meter. There is a boat pier very close to the hotel at around 100 meters where you can board the regular boats that transit the river or the tourist hop on hop off boat. In addition, just in  front of the hotel there is a small pier where you can hire a private boat for a sightseeing tour. The hotel is also at a",5,0.4215
"Extremely helpful and friendly staff, nothing too much for them. Room was excellent, beautiful river views. Exceptional setting overlooking river for breakfast, drinks, dinner, great pool. Khao San neighbourhood is right on hand, fantastic night life, market, music, food. Access to city centre and metro so easy on river and by canal barge from phan fa. This is a great hotel, well run and in the best location. Thank you, we will be back. ",5,0.9916
"Having been to Bangkok before I wanted to try out a new location- previously I had stayed nearer the downtown area near to the Arawan shrine which was great but I wanted to be nearer to the main sights this time around.    Riva Surya is just above the Grand Palace and Wat Pho right on the river front.......a 15-20 min walk gets you to this area or a short trip on the express boats from pier 13 (a two minute walk from the hotel &amp; 15 baht fare) also gets you there- a great location to visit these main attractions.   The hotel is also only a 5 min walk from the Khaosan area with its massive array of bars, restaurants and shops. Whilst this area isn’t everyone’s cup of tea, it certainly provides an experience that you shouldn’t completely miss out on.   The hotel itself is very",5,0.9563
"Pros: Nice rooms with view of river and bridge. Friendly staff, great location few mins walk from Khao San Rd.  Cons: Wifi is slow on balcony.  I'd recommend for couples and singles looking for a place to stay in the heart of Bangkok",4,0.9118
Stayed here for four nights. The staff was extra friendly and service minded. They assisted us to find nice restaurant in the neighborhood and the neighborhood was very save and loot af nice restaurant in walking distance. The room was spacious and clean and the view over the river was extra plus.  ,4,0.9324
"The Riva Surya is a perfect boutique hotel. The rooms are spacious with good amenities. The staff are very friendly and helpful and it’s situation on the river, close enough to Kaesan Road, the Grand Palace and other must see places. If you want to venture more to the centre or East of the City, traffic can be terrible but that does not in any way detract from this great hotel.",5,0.9381
"We stayed at Riva Surya Bangkok for three nights in early December. This is a beautiful boutique hotel in a great location, walking distance to many of the city's sights, including the Grand Palace, Wat Pho and Khao San Road. I highly recommend a river view room. We had a lovely balcony overlooking the pool and river. The room itself was very comfortable with all the modern amenities. We enjoyed a couple of delicious breakfasts in the outdoor dining room overlooking the river.  Lucky for us, our trip coincided with King Rama's procession down the Chao Pharya River to the Grand Palace. Unlucky for us, the festivities closed the palace for the day and the hotel required our room be turned into a tomb with the curtains closed and no balcony access. We headed downstairs only to",5,0.9881
"The hotel is perfectly located and has its restaurant pool and bar just by the river. Although it is so well located it still feels really calm like a quiet getaway when you’re their perfect after Bangkok hustle and bustle. The staff is lovely, reception and staff at the restaurant at breakfast/lunchtime. Food is good. Great massages.  Highly recommended.",5,0.9816
"It is easy to get around to many tourist attractions from this hotel.  Restaurant has a terrific breakfast and happy hour.  We felt safe in the hotel and in the surrounding area.  Staff were friendly and room had a great view of the river.  Comfortable and stylish, we would recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,0.9808
"An hotel with perfect location, in the center and by the river with any types of boats to discover the city, the monuments, the  klongs. Relaxing and quiet swimming pool with view in the very heart of Bangkok. Breakfast very good. Rooms quiet, nice and clean. Staff lovely and efficient. Massages not expensive and good. A special thanks and congratulations for the New Year's Eve party just fantastic, buffet amazing and organisation +++ A perfect stay! Highly recommended hotel  ",4,0.994
"Loved this place. Great location on the river, easy to get to all the main temples, Grand Palace, Wat Arun with good restaurants nearby. The rooms were well maintained also the staff is beyond exceptional.  Would definitely stay again!",4,0.9678
"We received the best room with a terrace and an awesome view at the river. Fresh fruits, water, coffee and tea were available at the room. Very comfortable beds. Best service and very friendly and helpful personnel. The New Years Eve Dinner including River cruise was a blast. We never saw such fireworks. Also the program and the buffet were extraordinary. We will definitely come back 😊!",5,0.9821
"This is a nice hotel on the river in Bangkok. Very comfortable beds and the people at the reception always were very helpful in ensuring our stay was pleasant.  The rooms with the balcony are very nice, with the balconies facing the river.",5,0.9513
"By Rick's wife: Riva Surya was a very nice hotel, room on the river (high floor, elevator). Staff (particularly concierge/reception people extremely helpful, more than any other place we were in Thailand. As a person who always uses at least one crutch, moves slowly, and has poor balance, I found it a problem that various places there were no railings--three steps without them or anything else to hold onto when entering the lobby.  I found a sort of circuitous way to get to the pool (where there was a ladder but no stairs) on my own.  There were almost always people to help but I like to be independent whenever possible.  By the way the lack of railings is endemic in Thailand (and lots of other places).  The attitude everywhere seems to be that one-five steps requires no railing.",5,-0.2748
This hotel is lovely. Our room faced the river with a balcony. This was a transit stay for two nights but we wished we could have stayed longer. Fantastic room but the bar and pool area weer amazing too. Great location convenient for everything you could want for a short stay in Bangkok. Highly recommended.,5,0.9727
"Arriving at then hotel can be a bit of a let down as the driveway, planting, facade and the entrance lobby is very unimpressive. The lobby is open to the driveway and not well designed. A bit tacky. The check in staff however are friendly. Appearances improve once you're out of the lobby and in your room. The rooms are well appointed and functional. The corridors though could do with a bit of a clean up and some attention from housekeeping. The terrace overlooking the river is great, its really one of the nicest places to have breakfast- watching the boats on the river. This is the best part of the hotel. There is a tiny swimming pool in the middle of the terrace which seems very exposed and not very inviting. We had breakfast on the terrace , food was good, again charming",3,0.9648
"We had been told it was relaxing to be on the river, but on arrival I was shocked by the noise level. The river is more like a water highway, coupled with the blasting music from the hotel’s bar, it was definitely not my type of place. We moved out after one night.",3,0.7498
"Visiting the great city of Bangkok, I choose again the Riva Surya for many reasons.  In the centrer but quiet. (Not the madness of Sukhumvit) Fantastic rooms and vue on the river.  Friendly area with live music (real performance) Great swimming pool  Most charming people working there",5,0.969
We would have loved to stay at the hotel for three nights as planned but the day before arrival we were notified about a mistake on behalf of the hotel. Dispite arranging another accommodation we were very disappointed and unhappy with the hassel of changing hotels after only one night.,3,-0.8843
Loved this hotel. Riverside location perfect for exploring old town and hopping on Bangkok’s local riverboats. Not in commercial centre so best suited for those who are happy to be away from there. Staff very friendly and helpful. Awesome breakfast options. Lovely room with a river view and exceptionally comfy bed and pillows. Highly recommend Riva Surya. ,5,0.9881
"Lovely hotel with staff who are consistently polite and helpful. Good location looking into ricer. Great for Palace and Reclining Buddha. Near to lots of restaurants and bars. Khoasan rd nearby if that’s your thing. Only had breakfast once which was fine, cheaper elsewhere but obviously not as convenient. Comfortable beds and showers large. A/C worked well. We had city view rooms, a little dark but probably naturally cooler than those facing the river. Would stay again",5,0.7428
"Location within blocks of Grand Palace and the Reclining Buddha as well as many other historical sites. Also has a nice market with plenty of food and vendors just a 5 minute walk away. Right on the river so have access to the water taxis as well. Great for sightseeing, shopping, and enjoying some yummy food.",5,0.9584
Lovely hotel lovely staff fantastic breakfast and nice pool and great location . Rooms spacious and had one with balcony overlooking river . Ate in hotel and food was very good . Overall would recommend,5,0.9744
"Good hotel, not too big, right by the Phrao Chaya river, with a very nice swimming pool and a cool bar/chill out area. The best thing about this hotel is its location: you can walk to the main attractions such as the reclining Buddha, the Grand Palace,… Just 3 blocks away you also have a nice street market with plenty of street food, shops and bars. The famous Khao San road, packed with bars, restaurants and nightlife is also within walking distance. The hotel is surprisingly relaxing in a city like Bangkok and in such a central location. Room: large, modern and in good condition. I strongly recommend a room with a balcony overlooking the river; there is a small supplement but it’s well worth it. Rooms with a street view are also nice, the main difference is the view.",5,0.9705
"We have stayed at the Riva Surya three times, always in one of the Riva rooms overlooking the river. The hotel is like a stylish mini resort with beautiful rooms, a wonderful pool deck, a nice restaurant and warm, enthusiastic staff.  Convenient to the river tourist and public boats. Close to the Royal Palace and other Central attractions. ",5,0.9628
"My wife and I enjoyed our stay at Riva Surya Bangkok.   The staff there is wonderful and very helpful. Our room faced the river and we did find it a bit noisy. It does quiet down after 10pm or so, but the boats start running again early in the morning (possibly 5AM). The hotel does provide ear plugs which we found helpful. The room itself was spacious and comfortable. Mattress and pillows were great. No issues at all.   We did find that taxi drivers had a hard time with the English address so make sure you bring the Thai address.",5,0.9657
"I decided to stay in this part of Bangkok on this occasion as it was on the river and not too far from the railway terminal for the Kanchanaburi line. It is a nice hotel and is reasonably priced, so it was great for my 2 night stay. The pool was great and the room itself was comfortable. The hotel is a bit away from the city centre but that is not necessarily a bad thing at times and was probably an influence on the pricing of the rooms. I wouldn't describe the neighbourhood as unsafe, so walking around at night wasn't an issue for me. I was having drinks next to the pool on the first evening, watching the river traffic go past and I had no complaints. There is also a good view of the bridges, nearby. I discovered a nice retail area across the road and up the laneway and I found",4,0.9244
"We stayed in the Riva Surya the third time during a stopover in Bangkok and it was a bit like coming home: A very committed and helpful team, the convenient situation and a pool next to  the Chao Praya. The rooms are not very big, but large enough for a short stay, and they are nicely styled and convenient.",5,0.8089
"My husband and I are Thais who have lived in many other countries outside of Thailand for work-related reasons in the past 20 years. During our long vacation in Thailand, Riva Surya is the highlight spot we chose to spend our time relaxing in Bangkok.  And our experience here was much more than expected. The balcony with river view is where we enjoyed our every morning coffee and evening hot tea. The atmosphere induces such long and pleasant talk that is crucial for a relaxing vacation for a couple like us.  By foot, by road or by water way, the location is perfect to explore different small nooks of the old town - our old stomping ground during the university days at Thammasat. We also found it super convenient to connect to MRT and BTS to get around to other parts of Bangkok.",5,0.9764
"Super friendly, great location just by the river and provides a wonderful place to sit overlooking the Chao Phraya, as well as a nice pool. Rooms are modern, very comfortable and super-clean with a good shower. Food is great and the service is efficient, with a smile.",5,0.9879
"Booked this hotel way in advance for a big birthday.  6 Nights in the Premium Riva room.  Had never been to Bangkok before so this was our base to explore from.  Firstly I have to say and I find this important the hotel are very responsive to e-mails.  We had some questions regarding our booking and trips &amp; we also booked a transfer.  I highly recommend this, our journey from and to the airport was seamless and the company used very professional.  Also we didn’t have to think too much about what time to leave hotel for our flight as the reception had done all of this for us – we just turned up!  Hotel is in the perfect position for all the tourist sights.  Either walkable or a river boat.  We soon got the hang of getting about.  There are enough good restaurants around as well",5,0.9369
"The Riva Surya is perfectly situated on the river with the pool, restaurant and lounging area overlooking this site. We were able to view the Royal Navy barge procession. The staff, especially Aum who managed the restaurant area, were so cordial, attentive  and welcoming. I cannot thank him enough for making each morning so pleasant for us.  We definitely would return to Riva Surya.",5,0.9175
This 30 room hotel has all the desired amenities and a good location on the river front.  Service was excellent and the restaurant is very good for those nights when you might not feel like walking to a local restaurant.  Relatively close to the Grand Palace and other must see attractions.,4,0.9359
"Hotel with a nice view on the Chao Phraya River, close to Kao San Road.  Very nice hotel, clean with welcoming, helpful staff. Close to many restaurants, cafe and the busy Kao San Road district and nightlife, although far enough so it gives you a quiet night.  Hotel is not too big, which I like.  Chose a room with view on the river with a balcony.  The manager of the bar had a piece of chocolate cake delivered to my room later the night he heard it was my birthday when I ordered a drink late afternoon.  So thoughtful!",5,0.9581
"We stayed here for two nights at the end of our holiday.  Initially I was not sure about the location as we arrived late in the day and the road outside seemed quite busy.  however, the fact the hotel is on the banks of the river means that if you have a riverside room it is very quiet with great views.  ideally it would be good to have a balcony as well. Rooms are well-equipped and very clean.  Staff are friendly and helpful and there is very comprehensive breakfast offering.  The hotel is quite close to a backpackers area with plenty of bars and cheap restaurants.  It would be possible to walk to the Grand Palace if you are reasonably fit and can cope with the heat.  However, the river bus quay is only a couple of minutes away and once you work out the system that is the",4,0.9812
"The travel agent that we booked our trip through did not know of this hotel - they are missing out! Fantastic location for The Royal Palace, the craziness of Khao San Road and yet has the absolute tranquility of a hotel much further away from the hustle and bustle of Bangkok.  We had an “urban” room, with as small balcony looking over the street, yet were never disturbed by noise from the road. The room itself was immaculate and we could not fault a thing. The food was excellent, the relaxing bar area overlooked the river, so we would watch the sunset and watch the river boats going past.  Last but not least - the staff. Nothing was too much trouble - always a smile, always wanting to help. Thankyou so much to you all for making the Bangkok leg of our trip so memorable.",5,0.8739
"After a very hectic holiday around SE Asia we booked Riva Surya for a few days luxury and rest before returning home.  It was everything we hoped for.  Beautiful room with river view, blissful pool, great food and perfect location for getting around.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  Our stay was perfect.",5,0.9854
"We stayed in room 504 which has stunning views of the river. It was lovely to spend some time relaxing and watching the river traffic go by. The location is great and provides a peaceful retreat from a manic city. The room was a decent size but the bathroom could do with some tlc - the shower in particular felt tired and leaked quite a bit. The food in the restaurant was good and service was attentive. A great choice from our lovely travel company, Imagine Travel. ",4,0.9598
"We had a 12-night stay, riverside-vieuw in a Riva Deluxe room (508). Everything was so clean and the staff was extremely polite, helpfull and friendly. We enjoyed watching de boats on the river from our balcony  and dinner with vieuw on the river. The food was of a high quality. Riva Surya is very well situated for visiting the old town and you can take all kind of boats in front of the hotel and hop-on-hop-off boat in less than 5 minutes walk.  Our stay was from 16 until 29 november with splendid weather of 34-36° Thank you Riva Surya for this dreamholiday... we will come back.",5,0.9564
"Everything about my stay at Riva Surya was perfect! All the staff were extremely polite,friendly and very helpful. The view from the balcony was amazing and I would recommend staying here to anyone visiting Bangkok.",5,0.9244
"We had a lovely 4 night stay at Riva Surya. The staff were incredibly gracious and friendly. We had a corner riverview room without a balcony (302) which was very comfortable and clean. We enjoyed watching the river activity from the king sized bed. The hotel is well situated to take advantage of the main riverboat ferries or the canal hop on hop off tour boat (5 min.walk). We enjoyed exploring the neighborhood found Mama’s Laundry to be inexpensive and efficient, breakfasted at Gecko Bar, and loved the Vietnamese noodle place across the street. We also enjoyed in room thai massages and the pool. Highly recommended. ",5,0.9902
"In the best possible place in the old city an it was on the river back, clean very good staff and helpful in any way. Everything vas just perfect if there is something maybe the breakfast can be a bit better. But I do recommend this to anyone ",5,0.9682
"The hotel has a great location right on the river. The rooms are well equipped and comfortable though a bit noisy at night if you are on the street side. The services for business travelers - namely high speed wifi is spotty and at times non existant. They really need to reconfigure the whole hotel for the purpose. The staff, while well, meaning can be somewhat rude. When I was in the elevator one morning a female staff member asked me point blank ""where are you going"". I was taken aback. When I was leaving the hotel to go next door to a UN agency I had my training equipment in two small carry ons. I was asked if I was checking out and I said no - just going to training, Then I was asked for my room number!!! A little odd and unexpected. And again maybe he meant well.",3,0.8054
"Bangkok is an exciting and often beautiful city, but it's noisy.  Riva Surya is a lovely hotel right on the river in a busy part of town that offers quiet atmosphere; comfortable, attractive, and spacious rooms; a riverside pool with better than average poolside food and drink service, and an extensive breakfast.  The salt water pool is small, but clean and attractive and a wonderful break after sightseeing. We arrived after a long flight to friendly, gracious, and helpful staff who made us feel welcome for our three day stay. The riverview rooms appear beautiful on the website, but honestly, our ""urban"" room was very comfortable, quiet and looked out over trees and the street below.",5,0.9968
"We arrived on the 16th November for 2 days prior to flying down to Koh Samui. This hotel is exceptional. The staff are willing to help in any way possible and go above and beyond. The rooms are spacious, immaculately clean and come with mini essentials for ease.  The beds too are insanely comfortable and huge! The restaurant provides incredible cuisine - primarily delicious Thai of course but some European alternatives for the less adventurous. The breakfast is  buffet and there’s something for everyone, the staff again are all there for you whatever you need! The pool is the perfect temperature to cool off after enjoying the Bangkok sunshine &amp; the loungers around are so comfortable. They often have live music at night which we enjoyed on the Saturday we were there so there",5,0.9903
"We had a room facing the river. We highly recommend spending the extra money. It is well worth it. A beautiful view. We enjoyed every second on the large balcony. The room itself was fine: a lot of space, good beds, nice bathroom, coffee and water.",4,0.9612
"I love staying at this hotel. The location is great, the rooms are comfortable especially the ones with big balconies overlooking the river, and good showers too. The staff are really friendly and helpful too.",5,0.9685
"We stayed at 5 different hotels whilst in Thailand, riva surya was by far our favourite! Some of the hotels we stayed in were nearly double the price and 5 star. But would choose here out of all of them. Everything we asked was easily answered, nothing was too much trouble. Staff were brilliant, especially the front desk. The view across the river is beautiful especially with all lights at night. It’s also got a few great food gems near by and only half an hour walk to grand palace or reclining Buddha. Would definitely recommend!! ❤️",5,0.9665
"Hotel facilities and staff were excellent, service very friendly and efficient. Helpful with any queries and we would rate accommodation very highly.  A relaxing oasis in a buzzing city! Excellent location on the river near old Quarter with easy access to all transport and walkable distances for food and temples.",5,0.9742
It lived up to all my expectations. A lovely boutique hotel In the heart of Bangkok. The room was great and the balcony was roomy with a fab view over the river. The staff were very welcoming and the hotel just had a great ambience generally.  It goes down as one of the best hotels I’ve stayed in so I hope I get to visit again - and stay for longer - in the not so distant future.,5,0.9801
"Loved this place. Great location on the river, super easy to get to all the main temples, grand palace, and night life. Breakfast every morning at the hotel is a wonderful brunch with a great assortment. The rooms were very well maintained and the air conditioning worked great. Also the staff is beyond exceptional. Cant thank Ae and Kevin enough they were very helpful. Hope to see yall again soon ✌",5,0.9893
"A three day visit to Bangkok this was a really good place to stay.  The staff are very friendly, the rooms are great, food was good and happy hour was a welcome transition from daytime activities to night time activities.  Get the breakfast included, it's worth it.  Steps away from the market, food, drinks, etc also easy access to the hop on transit.  If you're looking for gluten free food, there is a fantastic place across from the hotel called Peeps.  So much to see in Bangkok come prepared to walk and sweat. ",5,0.9864
"This hotel exceeded all expectations, both in location as well as cleanliness of the room and friendliness of the staff. Right near the pier and so easy to access all the places we wanted to go. Breakfast was great - Aum helped us and was fantastic (plus made great lattes!). I would definitely recommend to any traveler.",5,0.9779
"Great location on the river, with lovely pool and outside terrace affording super views of the river. Rooms are spotlessly clean and comfortable, super mattress for great night's sleep and decorated in cool muted tones of grey and taupe. Staff speak good English and are very polite, frindly and professional.",5,0.9851
"From the moment we stepped in we received a warm welcome from all the staff.  They made us feel very comfortable.  The room was immaculate and well maintained.  Great location, away from the busy Bangkok life and easy to commute to most places.  Will stay there again as long as we have a room facing the river😃.",5,0.9485
"Fantastic hotel in a very good location. Right on the river with proximity to boats, just like famous tourist routes and the big temples. The service is really top notch, super friendly staff! I was also pleasantly surprised at the breakfast. A fairly large buffet but what you need, including very good coffee. Fresh! The room was always clean and stocked with coffee and water. Also the gym and pool were good, as was the wifi connection. No problem backing up photos from today's adventure.",5,0.9732
"Super friendly and helpful staff. Great pool and poolside food and drinks. Brilliant service and faultless location. Have stayed in the Oriental and Shanghai La in Bangkok before and see this as a smaller more boutique version on the riverside. Handy too for boat trips to Siamcity, Grand Palace and anywhere on the river. Would definitely stay again!",5,0.9794
"Just spent 3 nights here- simply fantastic, clean pool stunning rooms great ideal location. The staff were incredible could not do enough for you. Simply a superb location and hotel. Food was great especially breakfast. Easy walking distance to bars and cafes- restaraunts in a very safe area. The views at the rear was straight over the river and bridges.",5,0.986
We bookended our trip to Thailand at this hotel and it was a real treat to stay here.  Perfect service and great rooms.  Located on the river the river view rooms offer a lovely view over the pool out onto the river.  Food is good too with plenty of breakfast options and we actually had  dinner which was really good and not too expensive.  I highly recommend this hotel if you want to be away from the centre and a short walk from Khao San Road.,5,0.9726
"Stayed for 2 nights (me, husband and 2 young kids) at the start of our trip around Thailand. A nice bit of affordable luxury that is close to the hustle and bustle of the old Town, Khoa San Road and the Temples.   The rooms were great, spacious and clean. The riverfront pool was great to jump in to after a few hours of venturing the Bangkok streets!   The staff were super friendly and helped out with any Q we had! The guy on the front in particular was absolutely amazing, especially with the kids!   Would definitely use as a Bangkok base again!",5,0.983
"Staff is extraordinarily helpful and friendly. Food is healthy and well prepared. Beautiful setting on river bank to enjoy dining, drinks and swimming. Room could use some upgrades but excellent service overshadows need for new tile.",4,0.9377
"Overall, great experience. The hotel staff was very friendly, the food was great, and the location was convenient for nearly everything. Would definitely recommend and stay here again when we return to the Bangkok area.",5,0.9509
awesome!i have to say you have to stay in this hotel. Service is so so so so good and u can feel customer is God.Good location 5min work to Khao Shan Rd and 10mins to Grand palace.  check in and check out so fast.,5,0.8276
"Excellent stay which form my point of view couldn´t be better. Location perfect, rooms in good size and very clean. Comfortable bed and wifi well working. Staff amazing and very welcoming. Do I have to say that I always stay here when in Bangkok:)",5,0.9815
"room sparkling clean,amenities were good..food in the restaurant were nice and waitress at our dinner last night very attentive. the easiest way to come here is take the boat from sathorn pier that connected with bts station took chao praya tourist boat (orange flag) and get off at pier number 13 phra atit..hotel located two minutes walking from the pier keep up the good work !",5,0.8899
"I stayed for 4 nights at this hotel during a business trip to Bangkok. My room was on the 3rd floor with a city view. It was an enjoyable stay. Room wad clean, quiet enough and staff was very friendly. I had breakfast in the restaurant on the ground floor twice during my stay. It was buffet style, no too much a variety of food, but taste good. The only problem I encountered was the TV since its signal reception was sometimes bad, specially when there was heavy rain outside.",5,-0.2508
"My wife and I stay in Bangkok regularly as she has family in Thailand. I usually don't bother reviewing the hotels as there have been so many and they are all pretty similar within their price ranges. Th hotel is such an exception that i felt compelled to give them the kudos they deserve. The location is stunning right on the river, 30 seconds walk from a ""hop on hop off"" ferry dock. Super easy to get to from the airport. The staff are lovely and very attentive with out the over the top fawning you can get in a lot of Thai hotels. They have a small pool and a great riverside bar which serves excellent food.  Spotlessly clean and good WiFi. You will see some complaints about noise particularly on the riverside rooms. We had a roadside room and you could just about hear the band",5,0.9866
"Checked out this morning from the Riva and needed to review ASAP to let people know how brilliant this hotel is. The staff are so nice, friendly and attentive. They literally couldn’t do enough for us. The room was gorgeously decorated and the bed was amazing, just what you needed at the end of a busy day sight seeing. The pillows are to die for... our heads sunk in as we drifted off to sleep in comfort. Every touch has been thought out and presented well. I have given it top marks even though the food isn’t that great because everything else out weighs it. ",5,0.9738
"The hotel is quite nice and cozy.  The staff were all very nice and helpful, and remembered us enough to always address us by name whenever they saw us.  Their service response times whenever we called down was also very good.  Even though they had signs up notifying guests of construction in the stairwells, we heard little noise from it.  The location of the hotel itself is also pretty good: right on the river Chao Phraya as well as within walking distance of Khao San.  The river location was so nice that we happened to catch the Royal Barge Procession rehearsal from our patio/balcony.",5,0.972
"Beautiful hotel, very clean and the design is gorgeous. Lacation is perfect close to Khaosan road and night market. Staff is very friendly especially Ms. Pui at the front desk. Thank you Riva Surya for a special treatment!",5,0.9738
"Beautiful Boutique hotel in the best area of Bangkok in my opinion. In front of the river so nice views and perfect location for hop on and off for a trip on the boats.   The hotel is from walking distence to Khao San road with other small streets for good streetfood and massages.   Service in the hotel is perfect! Restaurant is a bit expensive but really good food and great cocktails! Thank you, Boy, for your attention and taking care of us.  The riverfront room is spacious and nice designed with a pretty bathroom, good shower! Very silent airco and overall a quiet room when the balcony doors closed. The boats on the river make some noice but I didn’t mind.  The ladies at the reception, Da &amp; Ae, are really kind and they help you out with everything such as printing documents,",5,0.995
very comfortable and well-furnished rooms. surprisingly quiet given its closeness to the Royal Palace area. breakfast very good. the rear terrace was a bit cramped by the pool. we ate in the hotel restaurant as we arrived late and it was fine,5,0.8685
Very nice hotel. Staff were very friendly and efficient. Our room was very clean and decorated with taste. The pool and poolside dining was very comfortable with lots of seating.  We entered the back of the hotel from the river having been on a long boat. We quite enjoyed the experience. ,4,0.9629
"We spent two weeks in Thailand at hotels with a similar star rating as Riva Surya, however, it outshined the rest. Most importantly, the location is ideal for someone seeing the sights. But otherwise, rooms are beautiful and comfortable, service is excellent, and the pool area is wonderful. Would recommend to anyone visiting Bangkok for the first time.",5,0.9722
"I took hubby to Bangkok for his birthday and Riva Surya was an excellent hotel choice. They prepared a small birthday cake and note for him upon our arrival. It was super thoughtful and appreciated by my husband. The room was large, clean and comfortable.The bed was super comfortable and sound proofing was excellent. We enjoyed sitting on the balcony in the morning to watch the boats go by. All of the staff were super sweet and helpful. The location is excellent and walkable to many sites. I would definitely stay here again.",5,0.9933
"We just returned from our trip to Thailand, and stayed at Riva Surya Bangkok for 5 nights! The staff was so lovely and always available to assist with hailing a cab or Tuk Tuk or help with any directions. They also kept the front desk open late to check us in after midnight after I let them know our flight got in later than expected. We had the breakfast one morning at the restaurant which was great, good quality breakfast buffet with a mix of continental and some Thai options. The room was clean and just as pictured, we had a street view - which surprisingly was quiet and we didn't hear much if any of the street noise even during traffic. The bed was the big highlight - BEYOND comfortable and the perfect balance of soft and firm for a good nights rest after an 16+ hour flight",5,0.9849
