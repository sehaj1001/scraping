"My partner stayed at Furama in a Deluxe room and found it to the usual high standard.  Despite the low level of customers, and a difficult time for hotels in Bangkok, the staff were friendly and approachable. The breakfast was a bit more limited than usual due to fewer customers but she found sufficient tasty food to make her happy. I had to advise of a late arrival due to a delayed flight and had  to cancel a future booking.  The Client Service Manager, Ms Pattama Khumsap, has been really helpful in that regard, offering a late checkout, and she assisted in arranging for a refund for the cancelled  booking.  Pool is nice with fine outlook.  A good hotel in Silom.",5,0.9294
"Stay : 22/2 -02/03/2020 Returning customer after 1 year away with a very warm welcome from all staffs at front desk same as Front Office Manager, Guest Service Manager, Concierge, Room maids + service staffs at the restaurant. It's still a best place for us to stay when we visit Bangkok, 8 days is gone too fast, wish we have more time there. Room is spacious, clean, quiet, wifi is so fast. Lot of helps provided by front desk &amp; Concierge staffs with all the inquiries and their knowledge of the local area are well advance. Breakfast buffet were excellent with lot of varieties and cater for western, asian (Thai, Japan, Chinese)+ fresh fruits. New 7-11 is on the same side and few steps from the hotel. Management &amp; staffs  maintain this property in a top notch of hygiene, high",5,0.9766
Stayed for 3 nights. Hotel room very large on the 8th floor. Balcony doors permanently locked apparently for safety reasons. Room was a shabby and cleanish Pool and bar on 20th floor good service and staff pleasant although staff on reception miserable although helpful.,3,0.8225
"Had 3 nights here in February,excellent value for money. Large spacious clean rooms. Very special staff. Good variety in the breakfast buffet.short walk to the sky train and Patong market .Great views from the sky bar .",5,0.9366
Furama Silom location is perfect for me! When walking into the reception the hotel has a touch of old world charm and the rooms have a modern elegance (I always stay in the Executive Club which is worth the extra few dollars),5,0.8932
"Good stay here again, I highly recommend paying the extra and going for a deluxe room. Superior rooms are not much more than 'crash pads' The deluxe rooms are excellent, quiet and luxurious. The female reception desk manager here is superb and speaks perfect English if you have any problems. We will be back again next year",5,0.9434
"We stayed allready some years ago in this hotel. The location is great, the room is also large. But we remembered him more elegant as a whole and with a more beautiful view in another room. The view from the swimming pool on the 20th floor is beautiful. Kind staff. Wifi was not working in our room  and the bathroom shower was a little bit broken. Unfortunately, the view from our balcony was also not very beautiful. The mattresses for hard for us. in rrestaurant and reception is ok Wifi internet. However good value for money.",4,0.979
"Furama Silom is a good accommodation in Bangkok, close tho the Skytrain station and with some good services such us the swimming pool on the rooftop. But structure is pretty old, staff not exactly gentle, and, in general, there are many alternatives less expensive and/or more attractive in the city.",3,0.8685
"I recommend this hotel for person, who came to the city for couple days and even more, because here in the hotel, in the bar, near the swimming pool on the roof you are like in a resort:) View on the roof was amazing. Big rooms on the 9 floor (we got 917 and 911). Clean. Good location for reaching Patpong market, another places. Nice stop before going to another islands of Thailand.",5,0.9413
"we stayed at this so called hotel for 5 nights from Jan.22-27,2020, upon arrival i asked for a room on upper floors,they gave us a room on the 8th,floor end of the hallway.The room was large ,sliding glass door which did not open and no windows not in the room and not anywhere in the hotel to get some outside air.....lol...in the shower no vent!. you can smell the dampness everywhere as soon as you walk in the hotel. you feel like you are in a prison...and no one really cared when you asked them why?? i don't know how they can work in a place like that!!!so disappointed ,and what a waste of money....",2,0.8118
My most exciting and comfortable visit. Tac at front desk was just amazing. Thing thing was such an amazing and cooperative staff. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel. Everything was just perfect.,5,0.9718
"The hotel is getting a bit old. The rooftop pool was awfull. It looks very diffrent than in pictures. They give you old and erän out pool towels. The deluxe room was big and overall nice, but The scent in the room was too strong. It smelled so badly that I was not able to sleep. Stay away from this hotel. It is overpriced and  very poor shape.",1,-0.6933
We stayed for 4 days. The room we were staying is so old and stuffy that I couldn’t breathe. When we mention to the staff they air it out and it was better. The bathroom facilities are very old and there is mould alongside the bathtub. I would love to return to Bangkok again but definitely not staying at this hotel at all.,2,0.7964
The rooms are really big and comfortable. Maybe not to new but for this price really good quality considering the other places I’ve been. The breakfast not so bad. More Asian than European but we are in Asia 😊. The area really good. Everything you need is near. It was good choice ,5,0.9683
"We really enjoyed our stay here. Rooms were clean, spacious and comfortable, staff was friendly and helpful,price was relatively inexpensive and the breakfast buffet was very good. Location is also very good, about a 10 minute walk to the Skytrain, Lumpini Park, Patpong nightlife if that's your thing, and the Super Rich currency exchange offering the best exchange rates in Bangkok (they post daily rates online).",4,0.9847
"Stayed for 3 nights. Arrived around 7pm. Checked-in was ok. I have to wait for few minutes before they allowed me to go to the room because they have to check it first. For some reason, i can’t connect to the wifi. Luckily, i bought a local sim with data in it. Room was big. Breakfast was ok. The facilities of the hotel is very old. Gym equipments need some upgrade. I did not bother to use the pool since it is quite dirty. Service was ok. Overall, the hotel is ok.",3,0.8378
"The location is good, close to skytrain stations, some restaurants and patpong nightmarket. Some of the staff doesn't speak very good english, but everyone was friendly. Brekfast was alright, nothing special though. Rooms are tidy, but a little bit worn out, they were doing some renovations though. Bed was nice and suportive. The rooftop pool and bar were nice, but could also do with some refurbishments.",3,0.9158
For check in we arrived too early so our room wasn’t ready. Because we were in a club room they offered us to use the executive lounge for breakfast which I thought was very fair of them. We then advised them we would go wait by the pool to which the said they would let us know when room was ready - they didn’t.  Once we got it - The room was a great size with a very large and comfortable bed so no complaints where the room  is concerned.  Re the Executive lounge- for breakfast you can pick from their limited range of foods or/+ pick food from the restaurant (immediately outside lounge). I would not say we were the biggest breakfast eaters or the fussiest but in our opinion the breakfast was dire.... I won’t elaborate as it will take too long. The food &amp; beverages on offer,2,0.605
We have stayed in this property last 15 years since it is called Tower Inn. Many employees have been working over 15 years . They are always helpful and warm. That is the big reason we chose Furama Silom over another hotels.  Location is good where near BTS Chong Nosi station ( 7min. walk ). There are many restaurants and bars near by. I recommend to book the room through their site  because they will give the 25 % early bird discount and early check in &amp; late check out. Highly recommend this hotel .,5,0.891
"Checked in to the executive suite at NYE and found a room which was not clean. Stains on the bed sheets, yellow stains on towels, stains on the floor. After complaining we were assured that issues will be solved but nothing happened. I wrote an email - no response. Next day we complained again, but again nothing happened. When I came back late at night to the hotel I talked to an employee about it who finally wanted to take immediate action to change room, but to me it was too late at night to pack luggage and change rooms - so I was assured that things will be solved the next day. The next day nothing happened. Despite Multiple complaints we had to sleep in dirty bed sheets for 2 nights. NYE party was terrible. Poor food, terrible live music.   Cardio equipment at the gym was",2,-0.901
"The Good: 1. room rate - competitive. good rate. reasonable amount for 3-nights stay. 2. friendly staff - from the front office to the breakfast staff, everyone is so warm and friendly. 3. great location - near night markets, train stations, and cheap eats places. lots of massage parlors and shopping malls nearby. 4. excellent roof top bar with swimming pool  The Bad: 1. a bit of flooding in the bathroom 2. rather hard beds, but this is subjective. might be comfy for other people's preference.  Neither Good Nor Bad: 1. breakfast selection - there were some selections which were repetitive, but overall, gets the job done. we got very heavy breakfasts on a daily basis.  good place to stay, will definitely consider this when coming back to Bangkok!",5,0.9364
Hotel is located in a great location close to Metro and Patpong Night Market. Hotel pool area is slightly dated but great after a day of sightseeing. Beds are extremely comfortable and good breakfast selection,4,0.9603
Stayed here for 1 night with my family. The check in was smooth. The parking is on the third floor as i wanted to park my pick up truck i asked the staff if i can park it on ground level and the bell boy declined as it was full of public vans taking guests for tours and excursions. The climb to 3rd floor parking is very narrow for even a small sedan let alone a pick uo truck. They should accomodate their guests vehicle before accomodating public vans to use their ground level parking space.  I was expecting a delivery from a supplier and went to ask at the reception if it came in and was rudely told by an aged lady that she didnt have anything for me and if i wanted a delivery i should wait in the lobby to get it myself. My wife is thai and she was appalled by the answer given,3,-0.7964

"Nice hotel with modern, clean, nice sized room.  Buffet style restaurant, with a good choice of food.  Rooftop bar overlooking Bangkok and a rooftop pool.  Not far from the skyline train station, so easy to get to the Choapraya River.",4,0.9318
"For Bangkok I look for a hotel with good rooms, breakfast, and preferably a good pool Andy’s at a fair price. I think this is the best option for us in Silom. The deluxe rooms here are excellent and from time to time they offer a free upgrade which makes for a special stay. The breakfast is just passable. As per the previous review many dishes are just so so. Overcooked, oily, or watery dishes are a bit too common. I like a good bread and oat dishes. They have standard white bread and a second one that had a hint of whole meal and was stale. They have oatmeal and Bircher muesli which is good but too thin. Not much oats. The water they serve has a chemical taste. Bring your own or if you go Executive Club there is water in the fridge. Other aspects of breakfast such as salads and",5,0.9343
"Stayed for the fourth time in this hotel.  Had a family room with two king sized beds; the room was clean, spacious and served our needs well.  Gym was good except for a broken recumbent bike - the gym had been refurbished since our last visit and had nice decor and music.  Our two complaints about the hotel related to the bathroom which had a poorly designed shower that caused water to flow on to the floor and required using towels to stop the flooding and to soak up the water; the other was the bland western and Thai food in the breakfast buffet; I resorted to having the Japanese food and congee however the fruit, salad and bread were very good.",4,0.6597
"We had a very bad experience here, not least because of the unhelpful and distant reception staff.   WiFI in the room was intermittent at best. Asked to change rooms but did not get a response. When we reminded them they switched us to a smaller room.  Most of the gym equipment doesn't work. Room carpets are old, knotted and stained. Breakfast is ok, with good variety and decent coffee, but arrive just slightly late and you won't get anything, as witnessed with group who arrived at about 10:05am.  Reception staff are very unfriendly and will barely look at you. Porters and kitchen staff are the only ones who will crack a smile.  Desperately in need of renovation and staff training.",1,0.4614

"It took me nearly 1.5 hours to reach here from airport (@ afternoon, friday) because of the usual Bangkok traffic congestion. Silom is one of the decent locations of the city to stay in. Metro is nearby (around 500m walk) and easy conveyance: tuk-tuk (advanced rickshaws of Bangkok), Grab (Uber/Ola of Bangkok) as the property is situauted at a prime location. Sagar Ratna and KFC are also located at a 500m radius of Furama also 4 outlets of 7 Eleven (Just like 24-7 in India) are really closeby. My room had wifi connectivity issues which really was a havoc but later on I got my room swapped with a room with an increased wifi range (Staff is really cooperative and supporting). Breakfast had not much variety for Indians but still better than expectations leaving us with chicken",5,0.7691

"From the 16th floor, every morning you could shout from the balcony of your room “Good Morning Bangkok!!!”. But you can’t. It is a pity, that you are not allowed to go to your balcony, doors are locked. The hotel is centrally located, some of the sights you reach walking. Overall recommendation: it’s a relatively cheap hotel, 50$US for a room, breakfast included. There’s a changing variety of food, nicely presented and with good quality.",4,0.6784
I checked in around 11.30 am on the 1st of September. The room was not cleaned properly. They didn’t do housekeeping at all for three nights. Very poor housekeeping standards..... cannot recommend to any one.,2,-0.6708
"The hotel is good but it could be better.The rooms are big but not very clean and they smell bad.

This was once our go to hotel but sadly the hotel is in serious decline.  Sadly the rooms seem to be getting neglected. Dated and a damp smell in our room this time.  Breakfast was once a real feast but now there is not much for farang or Asian. Separating the chef from a couple of pieces of bacon was like separating a mother from her children🤬  Sad as the hotel is a great location and views from the pool at night are second to none and free👍 I hope some investment comes soon to rejuvenate this once lovely hotel😭,2,-0.6817
The worst hotel I have ever visited. Old and dirty hotel.It smells really bad.Very poor services. Bad location.  Staying there was not holidays for us. I was counting the days in order to leave. Very bad choice. I do not recommend it at all.,1,-0.9689

"I visited there on May, 2019. The hotel is located not quite far from the BTS chong non sri. However, walking along the road at night was quite dark and creepy. The lobby was quite small and crewed. The staffs were nice and friendly. The room was quite old, with musty odor. The bathroom was nice with a huge bath tub. The breakfast had low variety, but the taste was OK.",4,0.8381
"Thanks that I get a good deal for this hotel that I booked online, and I choose the whole package with club floor benefits. The price is very cheap and reasonable. What I get is more than what I expected. Yes ... I agree, with the hotel staff which is not so fluent in English, but with a little bit patient, I think we can communicate well.  The Club Room is located at 19th floor with huge room and a balcony as well. Good view of Bangkok from your room. The bed is comfortable, the water pressure is excellent, I got nothing to complain for the price that I paid.  As I buy the club benefit package, it is entitled for 6-12am access to the club executive longue at the 2nd floor while you can enjoying the busy road side in the evening. And also 6-8pm u can get some snacks and free",5,0.9925
"Absolutely disgusting hotel. Dirty, dusty, damp, poor quality and looks nothing like the website. Will never stay again. Cockroaches on balcony mould in bathroom.   They spend so decorating reception they forgot about the rest of the un kept hotel. The maintenance level is poor.   Enjoy the old cupboards and tainted furnishings.",1,-0.8994
The lobby was small and crowded.  The room was comfortable and had a good view of the city. It was also spacious and had a good corner just for working which I like it alot. Executive Lounge is on the second floor next to the breakfast area which makes it pretty noisy in the morning.  However Happy Hour is quiet and the staff are generally friendly and approachable.  A decent 4 star hotel in Silom.,3,0.9643
"We are use to luxury and was a little bit afraid of something else than a 5 star or palace. For convenience we booked a Deluxe room in this hotel. The CI, was a little bit pushy but was polite and professional. The staff are attentive and sincere (they really want to help, not only for tips) The room, 1711 for us, was with no exception perfect. Perfect AC, clean everything, nice amenities, nice view with a nice desk. Bed was big and clean, 5 star style. (double king size, I almost lost myself in it) A housekeeper entered the room instead of me saying ""buzy"" but it is only because I was on the opposite side of the room, mean far, and she apologized plenty so it's fine. Breakfast was included. For an included breakfast it's very good. But some cheese would be enjoyable. Meanwhile",5,0.9934

"Rooms are spacious, a bit dated but ok.  I always look for a hotel which has rooms with balcony, this one has but it is closed off, no idea why, so that was a disappointment.   Our welcome at the reception was horrible.  The employee of the quarter was most unfriendly, no “hello, welcome to our hotel”, no welcome drink (which all the others in the lobby did get).  We asked if we could eat, answer: no 😳  We had to amuse ourselves for 3 more hours, outside, in the rain, because the room wasn’t ready and apparently we weren’t allowed to use the hotel facilities without a room. The pool area is dated, a paint job and some new furniture would work wonders.  There also, the staff was not very interested in the guests.   So, not a hotel I would recommand...  ",1,-0.7138
"I have said before it is best to book deluxe room as they are nice and modern. Booked Executive Club which gets you a deluxe room and you can have few snacks and drinks in a special room and free alcohol between 6 and 8. I am not a big drinker so it may or may not be worthwhile paying more but it’s nice to hav3 a drink before going out.  I think this hotels breakfat is really good for a 3 and a half star hotel. It has some good things like porridge, Bircher muesli, brown rice and interesting things like funny pickle dishes, fried small fish and good vegetarian meals for my partner such as fried tofu and basil. They have all the other stuff you expect with good bread fruit and salads and the meals are good. The location suits us and is not far from BTS.  The gym is not amazing",5,0.9917

"We were visiting bangkok for a family vacations. While selecting place to stay few priorities were kept in mind. Away but not far from brustling shopping district i.e. a quite and clean neighborhood with amenities that we require i.e. 7 eleven stores, few indian restraurnts, access to places to visit in 15 min drive by taxi or bts, large clean rooms for 3 members, 4 star hotel amenities and reasonable price. Furama fit in all. Localities we considered were sukhumvit, siam, silom nd river front. I found silom hotels reasonably priced.

"Booked to stay on two occasions once in the Junior suite and once in an executive room, the rooms were both clean, good furnishings, comfortable bed, good WIFI , great bathrooms both with glass windows into the bedroom (blinds are provided) serviced daily. The executive lounge is a letdown, its a room next to the main restaurant on the first floor with views of the street, the food was cool and not inspiring, drinks were adequate and served to you, the staff were pleasant and friendly but after experiencing other lounges this is not really worth bothering with.

Silom is a fascinating neighborhood, turn left , as you exit from the hotel, and a short 10 minute walk lands you in the Bangrak area, and onto the Saphan Taksin ferry terminal, which takes you to Chinatown(15bahts only, by ordinary ferry).Walk left via a narrow shopping alley, and another 10 minutes will get you to Phahurat (or, Little India). A morning well spent, sampling the little eats and bytes along the way. Now back to the hotel-excellent staff, all experienced hands, except for a jock concierge guy, young stud , who acted as if he was doing you a favour. My only",4,0.9364

"The staff always smile, and they are very nice. I lost my luggages the other day, and they assisted me to brought them back.  I also impressed the swimming pool on the rooftop, the view was so nice. I would recommend this hotel to my friends to come to stay.",5,0.9334
"My wife and I stayed here on our first visit to Thailand, starting in Bangkok. The hotel is in a great location with easy access to the river ferries and as a result many of the tourist high spots. The room was spacious and clean and the breakfast varied and plentiful. The pool area and rooftop bar were great to chill out at the end of the day with a welcome sundowner. ",4,0.9501

Brilliant location to get to all the sights if Bangkok. minute walk to patpong market. BTS station close by and so close to all the major shopping malls. Rooms are clean and comfortable. Only criticism is you were not allowed to use the balcony in your room. The doors are kept locked. ,4,0.7845

"Returned to Furama Silom on Feb.10 for 8 days, as usual very warm welcome from Duty Manager Khun Parkboom same as other staffs at Reception. Thank you so much for your hospitality, also many thanks to Khun Pattama, Khun Boonrasi (Ong), few others girls and boys in the Reception area, provided lot of help, and smiles during our stay. Sorry, I couldn't remember all your names, I'll note them down next time.

Room was good, cleaned and roomy for couple, another bed can be added if required, the internet access was very fast, although there was few problems due to technical issues but the staffs on duty fixed",4,0.8997
"Stayed for 3 nights as part of Tui 2-centre holiday.  Excellent location within easy walking distance of the Skytrain which in turn easily gets you to the river ferries.  Patpong is a few minutes walk away and is the only place to visit in the evenings for excellent food, fun bartering in the markets and to walk and see the sights.  We visited during Chinese New Year and will never forget the noise and the bright lights.   The hotel itself is clean and quiet, the rooms are huge and the breakfast was typical of a city hotel with lots of choice.  We found the reception staff friendly.  The roof pool was clean, the bar staff helpful and the views across Bangkok stunning.",4,0.9887

"We´ve stayed here 3 nights. The location is fantastic. You´re in the heart of BKK, near sky train stop and walking distance to good restaurants and bars.  Nice rooms. Very spacious and clean. The breakfast is also good but it would be nicer if they do fresh fruit juices instead of artificial juices. I would stay there again if I ever return to BKK",5,0.8997
"This hotel is in a good location. It's within walking distance of the Famous Bangkok Night Market, Patpong. The Skytrain isn't far away and is cheap and great to ride on. The hotel itself has large, clean well equipped rooms. The staff are pleasant and helpful. The breakfast is good and has a vast choice. The lobby isn't very welcoming especially if you're dropped off by a car. Usually they're very imposing and palatial but not this one which on first sight is disappointing. As there is a step into the room and the bathroom it's not suitable for people with walking difficulties or who are in wheelchairs. Why do they have windows with blinds on all the walls in the bathroom? Not very private when you're on the loo. We had the blinds closed all the time. We've have come across",4,0.1759
Nice location perfect place to stay with all the amminities ...situated on main silom road very easily approchable to the main market too...would recommend to friends and family who so ever will visit Bangkok...,5,0.9299
"Well to be honest we was a little disappointed at staying at this hotel. The rooms are just not that nice , if you paying a low price then all good but we paid quite a lot for this holiday and didn’t except a room like this. The balcony you can’t go on to and there is a horrible big air con unit to look at when the curtains are open . The rooms smell a little musky from food and no elegance at all. Very standard. The roof top pool area is nice and they do BBQs in the evening where the food is pretty good. But the rooms need attention for sure . We didn’t stay a lot there so wasn’t the end of the world as we was busy exploring and only there for 3 nights. If paying a low fee then exceptional. We booked through tui and was not what expected: but clean and friendly .",3,0.9685
"This hotel is one of tui hotels they use the hotel itself is good very clean and rooms are big , very polite staff and breakfast had good choices , the roof top pool is ok my only concern is why does a tour operator like tui use this hotel really it’s more of a business hotel , there is no lounge to sit in and no bar to chill out after a day in the city we had to use the hotel opposite, we went in for breakfast on the first morning  found a table and proceeded to get our tea coffee juices and breakfast sat down and litterly half way through eating it a waiter asked us to move as this table and the surrounding tables had been reserved for a large company who were staying in the hotel , clearly it didn’t go down happy with us I said to my wife just carry on we’re half way in to",3,0.9459

Hotel located in good place, interesting part of Bangkok for tourist a specially for nice food in different restaurants, bars and on the street. Highly recoomended Bangrak Bazaar. KItchen from Thailand, Korea, Vietnam and Japan. Nice and cheap food and interesting local place. Close to Patpong street, very nice, really taste street food and red district :-)",4,0.9851
"The hotel is very nice and situated in a good location, about 7 minutes from the BTS and across from a bus stop, with lots of street food nearby. Although we arrived at the hotel late in the evening, the check in was quick and friendly; courtesy of the lovely receptionists we received a beautiful room on the 17th floor which was enormous and the bed very very comfortable.   The breakfast buffet has many Thai and Western choices, an omelets chef, fresh fruit and decent quality; the rooftop pool and the sky bar are excellent, the view from the 21st floor was my favorite skyline view I saw in Bangkok; Wi-Fi is very stable. I wish I could have stayed longer!!!!!",5,0.9888
"The hotel itself is a few minutes away from the nearest Metro and surrounded by lots of restaurants, shopping complexes and other attractions (night markets and Patpong area). The breakfast buffet was plentiful and varied from Asian, Japanese and Western choices. We were given the upgrade room on 15th floor which was great as the view was quite good. ",5,0.8777
My husband and I have stayed in Furama Silom many times. All staffs are very friendly . It is short walk to the nearest BTS station. The area is business district so you can easily find the good restaurants near the hotel. Rooms are huge and very clean. Beds are comfortable but the pillows are extremely thick . We loved the roof top pool to see sunset. Overall we enjoyed our stay in Furama Silom. Highly recommend it. Thank you for your hospitality !!,5,0.9836
Decent budget hotel and friendly stuff. The hotel is reasonably clean. The hotel is 5 minutes walk to the nearest train station. We used Grab (similar to Uber) to travel as it was a lot cheaper. There are decent place to eat near the hotel.,3,0.7096
"Though its not my first stay in Furama Silom, but can very confidently recomend this place for their many good facilities and services. Clean big rooms, friendly staffs right from Reservation/Front office till the bell boy. They are very cooperative and always ready to help. Location wise its in the middle of Bangkok Financial hub as well as night markets. will surely stay here again.",5,0.988
"Went one evening with husband, son and his wife - there wasn’t a huge selection  but what they had on offer was excellent, especially the fresh prawns, salads and sushi. Service was good with constant topping up with water. Great value with eatigo discount-Would recommend as a decent budget buffet and would go back again.",4,0.9797
"The location of this hotel is great, very central. The room was extremely spacious and a good bathroom. Weirdly the corridors and rooms have thick carpeting (woudn't wood be smarter and easier to clean?). Bathroom was clean and functional, staff pleasant, and I have to say that they leapt into action over a misunderstanding about some items which we thought were missing from the room - very very conscientious about security which is reassuring. The rooftop pool was a bit cramped, and the gym, again with carpet stank of sweat (guys... carpeting a gym is a total no-no ! lay down some cheap wooden surface). Overall comfortable and pleasant.",3,0.9497
"The room, service and location are the highlight of this property. The only thing that lets it down is the breakfast it is not great food however it did notruin our stay at all. Our room was very big so much space and a great view of the city on 18th floor. The members of staff we spoke to were polite and welcoming every day. The location was great, easy walk into the busy parts of Bangkok (although the whole of Bangkok is busy!) The roof top pool is a lovely area too, well maintained and amazing 360 views of the whole city!!  Would definitely return if I am back in Bangkok again!",5,0.9133
"When we travel,  we always stay at the furama chains.  Upon arrival at Furama Silom,  we were warmly greeted by the lovely reception Ms. Metpapha and Ms. Ammara. Since we stayed for 7 days, they were kind enough to upgrade our room with a great view of the city.   Everything is perfect,  bed was comfortable for sleep and honeymooners.  The kind house keeping lady on level 13 made sure our room was always stocked up and we had clean towels every day.   Breakfast is a little hectic,  too many people staying in the hotel and it might be good if they hired more staffs to clean up the empty plates from the tables so the next people didn't have to walk around with their plates waiting for the tables to be clean.  Selection was ok,  we had the same exact menu for 3 straight days so",4,0.9906

"We spent a total of four nights in the Furama Silom during our holidays in Thailand and we were not disappointed. We stayed in two deluxe room, the first night on the 18th floor and during the second stay of three nights on the 14th floor. Both rooms were OK, quite large, with a big bed, a desk and a sofa. The room furniture is OK, nothing special. The bathroom is large with a shower and bathtub. The peculiarity of the bathroom is that it has glass walls. Actually, I like bathrooms with glass walls, but it is the first time I got a room were also the WC is exposed. That it is a bit too much. Luckily there are rollups that can make the bathroom more private. The aircon worked well in both room, while the lighting in the second room was, for some reason, less effective than in the",4,0.9459

The bathrooms have decent showers and some have glass walls which mean that people showering can be seen through the glass from the bed (!)  The breakfast buffet offered plenty of choice with a Japanese counter as well as European and Thai but quality of food was not very high.

Room is good sized good breakfast choices location bit out of night life no good for wheelchairs because it’s got high bath tubs and steps into the toilet the pool is  not as there are steps to the pool and the glass window in the bathroom can be a bit of embarrassing if you have children as there is no blind but overall not a bad place to visit ,4,0.5824

"I stayed three day in superior-room.   Positive:   - My room on the ninth floor was huge and clean. ). - Staff was friendly and helpful. - Good shower. - Huge sofa. - Great price!  Negative:  - My bed was a bit uncomfortable (too hard and it had some kind of weird flex). - Old air-condition with lots of noise (but it was easy to get good temperature). - Breakfast was just ok.  Conclusion:   What you get is a huge room for a very reasonable price. It takes about 5 minutes to walk to the nearest BTS, and 10-15 minutes to walk to Silom MRT. This area is surrounded with extremely good food (check out Silom soi 20, the food court in soi 10 and the restaurants called Hai and Mama Mia).

Free toiletries and water daily. the cleaning staff did a great job and after cleaning the room  and seeing my husbands birthday cards (or maybe after seeing his passport on check-in) they left a slice of card with a candle in, in our room. The pool and bar area on the room where lovely and the breakfast buffet was vast. We had a couple of meals in the restaurant which were OK, but the evening buffet was great value for money. Excellent location walking distance (or a short Tuk-tukride) to Patpong Market and 10mins walk to Chong Nonsi BTS station for the skytrain.",4,0.9762

This stay was my third and sadly the first two days were not so good. On my first night I noticed a couple of flies in the room but they did not bother me. The second night there were more and when I looked in the bathroom the ceiling was full of them. I complained to reception and they said they would take care of it but when I returned it appeared as though they had not. The next day I woke up to find my bed was full of ants on the side I wasn't sleeping luckily. I called reception straight away and asked to switch rooms. I really did not want to switch rooms as the reason for having a hotel for 4 nights is to unpack and relax but there was no other option. The lady on reception did not seem to understand my request.

Bar and pool staff were very attentive and friendly.  It's not the best location but depending on what you're in Bangkok for does make a huge difference.  Stone's throw from the hotel there are restaurants, pubs and banks. There's a bank/money exchange just a 5 minute walk from the hotel. As you leave the hotel turn right.

When we went to front desk they were much more interested in knowing if someone was smoking in the corridors to fine him than changing our room. We were finally relocated 2 floors up and this new room looked like an apartment more than a hotel room (1215) (own kitchenette, fridge apart of the minibar, sink...). It was dusty and old.
