"In the wake of the pandemic incident occurred in 2020, I had a chance to do my weekend staycation at Siam kempinski just a few weeks before Bangkok's closedown. The price of the hotel had dropped significantly so it gave me a chance to book duplex cabanaù room type with a lovely price. I was greeted by the lady in redù Miss Namkhang, who escorted me to room. She was very kind and attentive. The accommodation was even better than in the website. I was very satisfied. I pretty much enjoyed the club benefit. The afternoon tea set was far better than many 5 star hotels, and the evening cocktail session was exquisite,in term of food and alcoholic beverage's quality. Thumbs up for the breakfast where they serve sparkling wine. Love it!  I would like to thank miss Namkhang the",5,0.9798
"Fantastic picturesque interior. Vaulted ceiling, inspired decoration and such friendly staff. The afternoon tea is amazing. The mezze and Thai iced tea are delicious. There is a wonderful lady that plays harp and she plays fabulously. Worth visiting as a break from the Siam Paragon shopping mall. ",4,0.9686
"Hotel is beautiful, well maintained. The bedroom is modern n very clean. Staff are friendly n welcoming. Golfcart Mr Buch is very helpful, nice chap! We enjoyed the great breakfast very much. Location of hotel is excellent next to Siam Paragon mall.",5,0.9829
"Awesome service from I stepped inside the hotel until I left. Well done to the ladies in red team! Walking distance to mall and BTS with huge number of dining choices. Despite hotel is getting old, the maintenance is superb. Will certainly stay there again in future.",5,0.989
"Fantastic experience with  my husband and  our twins  : Kempinski services were absolutely perfect  : breakfast and food, conciergerie, room cleaning, pool area and services....Kids club and cooking class are amazing ! Staff is really providing terrific service. We are grateful also for the capacity to listen our feedbacks and make changes when needed. We will certainly come back, a huge thank you to the team !",5,0.7096
"I was for a four day stay in this wonderful hotel. Usually I am not a big fan of Kempinsky - seems to me just too old in style and design. However, this Kempinsky is the opposite and very modern, stylish, perfectly located and directly at a huge modern mall. Staff was always friendly and best service was at breakfast. At the second day the staff knows exactly what we liked (such as Cappuccino or Omelette).  The service and handling in times of Coronavirus was very good, such as temperature testing entering and leaving the hotel, everywhere sanitizers (even in the elevators etc.). The pool areas was not overcrowded and well of service. The rooms are very clean and modern, but not cold in design. Ambience lightning, tear-down service, amenities etc. were all very good and no",5,0.9686
"Another business trip, another great stay at The Kempinski. Nice big rooms with great amenities, Niche restaurant is first class, great facilities e.g. gymnasium and location is perfect. But what keeps me coming back time after time is the fantastic service from the moment you arrive, to the moment you leave. Big smiles and always willing to help in any way they can. Special mention to Lady in Red service who add that special touch and also want to call out Mr Buch, who provided exceptional service and great conversation when he drove me to my business meeting :)",5,0.9643
"Despite these challenging times with the Covida-19 virus affecting tourism to Thailand, this hotel is not cutting corners.It is offering a memorable stay with attentive staff tending to your needs &amp; an abundance of food meticulously prepared by connaisseur chefs. We stayed there for the weekend &amp; could see that the hotel takes precautions in screening arriving tourists with temperature checks &amp; offering hand sanitizers as you walk into the hotel lobby.We were booked into a duplex room at the garden wing of the hotel offering direct access to the pool from your living room. Mrs Phitchayapha (Lady in Red - a signature feature of the hotel) escorted us to our room. The Garden wing is also a short walk to the Executive Lounge, where one can enjoy afternoon tea &amp; evening cocktails",5,0.9879
It's one of the most gorgeous hotel i see or stay in. Very nice and the reception people are fully helpful and kind helping gusts. They take me straight to the room after Check-in. Nice breakfast.  There is a bridge to the Paragon mall.,5,0.9956
"Its pricey but definitely worth it. The staff are amazing and anticipate your needs. Rooms are nicely furnished and well equipped, the food and drinks in the mini bar are complimentary. Pool is great. Love the breakfast outdoor, oasis in the middle of Bangkok. Free shuttle to nearby mall. Must visit again. The only hiccup is our room at 4th floor near the lifts, the door bell rang every night at 3am but no one was at the door. We are not superstitious people but I told the reception to check the security camera. Also pretty noisy on a Saturday. Ask for higher floors. ",4,0.8999
"We were in Siam Kempinski Room 34 the Deluxe Cabana for 4 nights in early Jan. The room was simple compare with the price and the luxury decoration in the hotel, Room 34 was far from everywhere as it locate in the end of the building and we had some issue with the lighting, shower temperature and noise, hotel was helping and sort the problems fast.  Except the issues from room, the hotel was wonderful for our short stay in Bangkok. Siam Paragon is linked with hotel and so easy to access and convenient for family who have young children as there are children activates around and great for someone who loves shopping for luxuries or local goods.  Great selection for breakfast, I found all my favorite thai dishes from the breakfast and lounge.  The lounge proved excellent service",5,0.9856

"Some say ... This hotel has no need to do an effort because of the big Siam Paragon comercial centre adjacent. Of course it is nice to have such a nice food court, luxuryshops etc near the hotel. But I'm very happy we decided to book this hotel instead of one of the luxury hotels near the river. This Hotel is a littleù oasis in the middle of this megapolis. It is near the malls and two metro station that connect you in no time to the must see in Bangkok. One metro station (BTS) from Jim Thomson's Museum house. Walking distance from Talad Neon Night market and 4min from the RedSky rooftop bar.Check-in was made in the room! Perfect! No waist of time! ALL the staff are looking to made the customer happy. They anticipated our wishes.  We chose to book a room at the executive floor.",5,0.9741

"Without doubt one of the favourite hotels my family and I stayed during my time in Bangkok.  We had stayed here for four consecutive years. This is not a five stars hotel or so, but the atmosphere is so special and it really felt like home stay to me.  A true sample of excellent hospitality.  The care is genuine and I really felt good while staying at Siam Kempinski Hotel.  No doubt, the best hotel in Bangkok.  Thank you so much you did everything for us.  Absolutely recommended.   May I take this opportunity to thank you the Managing Director Mr. Richard Schestak who does a great and upward bound team here.  Today is the end of 2019.

It is a hotel in a very convenient location. It is perfect if you come with kids that are not too young. They can go to mall directly by the bridge. The staffs are all very polite. However it is a too busy hotel for me. I stayed at the  cabana room and its quite noisy. Many kids running  around.  ,4,0.9195

"From the time I arrived at 2:30 am in the morning to the time my wife and I left, the service, staff  and general feel of the hotel was 5 Star. The grounds and pool area contained within the hotel were calming and kept immaculate by the ground staff. We ate at the NICHE restaurant. After the first meal we had there, we decided it wasn't worth going anywhere else. The service and staff were exceptional, friendly and interactive which was pleasing to see. We will be going back. Thank you for a great relaxing experience. The Hotel is immaculate, Santa was there when we stayed, so I made sure I put in my Xmas Wish List. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone who is looking for a great central location with excellent service and food.",5,0.8143
"For Bangkok, at this price point, expectations should be very high, but the Siam Kempinski delivers on many counts.   First, location. The hotel is linked to Siam Paragon via a short air conditioned bridge, and Siam Paragon is in turn next to Siam BTS station. Second, facilities. The rooms are well appointed, as are shared facilities like the pool and gym. Third, service. Every hotel staff I met was unfailingly professional and willing to go the extra mile, from wait staff to buggy drivers like Mr Buch.   But the most memorable times for me would be my long breakfasts at the Niche, where the menu includes a beautiful selection of eggs and omelettes. ",5,0.9729
"Our latest stay at the Siam Kempinski was our fourth so far. We like the convenience of having Siam Paragon shopping mall literally just across the street. However, this time it was the excellent, efficient and attentive service from the staff that was the stand-out feature - particularly in the Executive Lounge, where the staff really went the extra mile for us and for whom nothing was too much trouble. The golf cart service to the nearby Central World shopping mall was also much appreciated. The breakfast in The Addition restaurant was excellent - and where, again, the staff were welcoming, attentive and efficient. The Kid's Club facilty kept our accompanying child entertained and happy. Overall, this is an excellent choice of hotel for anyone planning a stay in the heart of",5,0.93
We stayed in the hotel for 2 nights and was quite impressed by the service. A great hotel &amp; perfect location to nearby malls.  Loved the complimentary  24hour golf car service to Central world.  Mr. buc the golf car driver is great! ,5,0.8688
"The Golf Cart service provided by the hotel was exceptional. It brings us to the nearby malls and restaurants without having us to walk there which will easily take 10mins or more. The service provided by Mr.Buch was excellent, warm and welcoming, wet towels were even provided to us and when he knows we are rushing to the airport, he personally went into the hotel himself to bring out the luggage for us when we alight at the hotel while waiting for the Grab's arrival. He really deserve a compliment from the management team. Overall, the stay was great and location is superb. I would definitely come back to stay there again.",5,0.9216
"This hotel provides 24-hour golf cart service connecting BTS station, Central World, and Siam Discovery and CPN Tower and Groove. We tried the service these 2 days and amazing excellent service standard. Such a short distance and the driver served us with chilled bottled water, his smile and professionalism further assured we made the best choice to stay in this hotel. The driver shared with us the useful tips that we could page the Golf Cart service via Information Counter of those shopping malls, without using our own mobile IDD call. The following day we tried another golf cart service and we were greeted by the another driver Buch with big sunshine smile. Very consistent high service level from this hotel. Highly recommend.",5,0.9476
"We stayed in Kempinski several times a year from Hong Kong. The service of all staff be we met on the room floor, lobby and entrance were superb nice and helpful. As Xmas is coming, there were Santa Claus and Xmas carol performance, and the atmosphere was very joyful.  The accessible location of the hotel added big bonus for our choosing to stay here every time we visited Bangkok.  Its value added service to provide buggy service at several convenient points at Central world, BTS round the clock was impressive. The two nice buggy drivers we met these days were friendly and helpful.   The buggy service was also helping us a lot to deliver the several shopping bags to the hotel. We will surely recommend others to stay here.",5,0.9829
Every time when we stay in Bangkok we will go to Siam Kempinski because of the excellent Service and the really nice Hotel.  every wish was fulfilled.  Problems were fixed immediately.  The service staff at the breakfast is extremely accommodating.  For children there is a fantastic area.,5,0.9278
"Very nice hotel with great facilities. The service is impeccable and the car for the airport transfert very comfortable. The only little thing is that they don't have sun cream to borrow at the hotel so don't forget fours!  If you use the golf cart service, ask for  Mr. Buch. He is great!!! Ken",5,0.8718
"Everything from check-in to check-out is perfect.  I am especially impressed by Buch, who brought us on a few buggy rides to nearby shopping area.  You can simply tell he is very sincere in helping you, always going the extra mile like carrying the stroller to the pavement.  The breakfast buffet is one of the best I have been, and the service crew makes us feel very welcome, every time.",5,0.9467

"I stayed with my family for a weekend last month and everything is as expected. The location is very convenient,  connected to Siam Paragon and BTS Siam.  Breakfast at their newly opened restaurant is sumptous and perfect for our taste. We enjoyed the poolside too, it is an oasis in the hustling and busy city.",5,0.9002
"Usually this is my hotel of choice when I travel to Bangkok for work. The staff is attentive and prompt, the breakfast in the top floor is well assorted (I remember the one in ground floor used to be messy since it took place in a very tiny environment, but as far as I know they have moved to a bigger restaurant space nowadays), the rooms are big and spacious, and duly cleaned.  This time I spent also the week-end, enjoying the pool for a few hours. They provide you with clean towels already placed on sunbeds, and they come around to give you cold water bottles. The very disturbing thing was seeing hotel guests, kids and adults alike, mostly from China, entering the pool (which is not deep at all) fully dressed! Usually you are required to take a shower before entering a pool...",3,0.9881
This hotel is located near a major shopping center with that they get the advantage of attracting many guests. As a result there is no need to provide a good service or even keep a booking. The hotel is classified as a 5 star hotel yet nothing about it is 5 stars. Kempinski Siam hotel have exposed the Kempinski hotel chains and how they treat their guests. The reception still uses manual registration forms and they take a copy of the passport in the back office using an old copy machine. The scanner technology have not yet reached the Kempinski brand. What is more terrifying is the fact that they show no compassion to the delay they cause during check-ins. I never seen a long line that goes all the way to the lobby with guests waiting to check in. The other staff are just,1,-0.8653

"Well, lets start by saying that I dont have anything negative to say. The location is fantastic at the Siam Paragon.  The BTS station is right next to the hotel. The foods fantastic, the bars good, the executive lounge is welcoming, the pool is beautifully laid out and the staff is a delight (always warm and smiling). You practically dont need to go anywhere outside if staying at this hotel. Love the place and would definitely return. Great job guys....",5,0.9818

"Walking in to Siam Kempinski is always like coming home which is why we come back again and again. The greeting is always impeccable, friendly and extremely professional. All Front Office staff are excellent; our former Lady in Red contact Natchananan has now sadly left the team for the time-being but stays working in the hotel as part of the Operator team. She made a point of coming to give us a personal welcome and a very pleasing gift of a Bedtime Pillow Mist - what a great product, always welcomed when we arrive and it actually works; giving a great nights sleep.  This product should be a standard in all guest rooms. Thanks Nat.  We look forward to many more happy stays ahead. ",5,0.9666

"Visited with friends a favourite event when in Bangkok- Sunday Brunch at Siam Kempinski. The variety and freshness of the assortment of food is impeccable.  The service as well is second to none along with the pleasant live music provided on the day. So last occasion we were entertained by singer Nawinda and Boyd on keyboard. Hosts and staff whom we have got to know and go out of their way to welcome us every time include but not limited to are Anucha, Natty, Napalai ,Bussaba,Porpan,Itsaree,Artitaya, Suphattra.  Highly recommend giving it a try, excellent value. Kuhn George",5,0.9414
The Siam Kempinski brunch on   Sunday is the best brunch in Bangkok. A little bit more expensive than other brunches but well worth the price. The staff are sensational and the food and inclusive drinks are just of the highest standard. Every time I'm in Bangkok it's a Sunday ritual for me and I've never been disappointed. TBH 4001 for the food and  free flow wine and cocktail package. ,5,0.8953

Location is ideal, the hotel decor and grounds are exquisite and so inviting, rooms are well appointed and beds comfortable, but, most importantly, the welcoming staff and their attentive service make this a place you look forward to returning to after a day in the hustle and bustle of this amazing city! We would like to make a special note to mention our first encounter during check in with Ms. Rungaroon who set the tone for our 5 night stay. Her polite demeanor and outstanding customer service, combined with the wonderful Thai warmth and hospitality, truly made our arrival at Siam Kempinski memorable.

"A hotel with first class amenities cannot cater to basic guest requirements, The room I was booked into had free flowing minibar. Unfortunately, only beer, water and softdrinks are in it. And since I do not drink softdrinks or beer, the free contents of the mjnibar was of no use. When I called up the hotel to request that juices be placed instead of the softdrinks, they simply said it cannot be done. Too bad. They are so inflexible. ®®  The pool by the way is sprawling at the center of the hotel. But it was more for those who simply want to wade in the water and play. For people who would like to do swimming lapses for their cardio exercise like me, the pool was of no use. The longest straight stretch one can have is 5-6 meters even if going in a diagonal direction.®®  So there",3,-0.4245

If you like to go shopping or just eat, walk about 2 minutes you reach Siam paragon shopping mall because itís just next to the hotel",5,0.9812
It would be hard to find a property and team more luxurious and hospitable than the Kempinski. I've never had better service or style. And the pool is one the best in the world. A must-enjoy. I visited for both work and leisure and enjoyed both immensely.,5,0.9905
"Kempinski is very conveniently located, adjacent to Siam Paragon shopping mall.  However, the rooms are starting to age with bathroom doors difficult to close and safes breaking.  Service is also inconsistent. Day time is good but night time reception is terrible, with no ownership and inability to make any decisions.  We had requested twin rooms months ago and at check in, they said no twin rooms of any room rate were available. With a hotel of this size, this is impossible. And after 20min, the reception somehow found 2 available twin rooms. This gave a very poor first impression which marred the entire stay. More training is required here. ",3,0.9669
"Siam Kempinski is a well-maintained gem of a hotel right smack in the middle of a bustling city. The service was attentive and staff took initiative to make sure all guests feel taken care of. Take for instance, during breakfast, one of the buffet items was being replenished, the staff take the effort to let us know it will be 5 min wait when he saw us waiting around for the dish. Subsequently, he took the initiative to send it over our table without being told to do so. This is a small gesture that shows that the staff are attentive and eager to help. Wonderful location as well and close to the major shopping districts in BKK. If there are areas to improve, we would say the quality of the toiletries were not exceptional and the toothbrush was stiff and the bristles were hard.",5,0.9903
"Landed Bangkok at 5AM - Hotel driver was waiting for us and we arrived at the hotel by 7AM.  We had reserved a ""Premier"" room the previous day, so we wouldn't have to wait around until the normal check in time in the afternoon.  Our room was in the Garden Wing.  The quality of the room finishes were very good, although the room felt tight and closet/draw space was lacking for two people on a two week trip - we weren't able to put all our clothes away.  The room had a narrow balcony overlooking the gardens.  We were given Executive Lounge access for the entire stay, which was a very nice perk, as they serve breakfast, afternoon tea, and evening cocktails.  The Exec lounge is on the 17th floor of the Royal wing which was on the other side of the hotel from our room. We did notice",5,0.9866
"Stayed again after 7 years, the hotel is still very well kept. There are many new luxury hotels since it was opened 9 years ago, however, Siam Kempinski still has it's charm in it's location, which is is linked to Siam Paragon Mall.  The hotel has few restaurants attached to the hotel, one of them, Sra Bua, was awarded a Michelin one star.  We stayed at the Royal Wing where we can use the Executive Lounge and the minibar is free. The breakfast in Executive Lounge was very good.  In conclusion, if you like shopping, this hotel is one of the top choice.  ",5,0.9833

"Amazing location, Good Breakfast Spread, Very Attentive &amp; Helpful staff Specially at the Door, very calm &amp; serene &amp; classy in the city of bangkok. Best Harp player with water sounds in the background.  We got early check after 2 hours with an upgrade that was kind but hoped that next time we get it on arrival instead of waiting. check in &amp; check out was smooth. Will be back always as i think its the best in bangkok.",5,0.964
"This was our 3rd stay at the Siam Kempinski this year, and the high level of hospitality and service has continued to be consistent throughout. The grounds and facilities are first class and well maintained, however for me and my family it is the genuine friendliness of the staff which is exceptional. Our kids especially enjoy the warm affection they receive from the staff from all sections of the hotel.  The breakfast buffet, and the brasserie Europa dinner buffet are all of a high standard with a good selection of dishes to choose from.  From the pool, to the kids club, and the restaurants we really enjoy all aspects of what this hotel has to offer, and we look forward to more stays here in the future.",5,0.9331
"One of the very best  hotels in the world  I have experienced. A central city location , opened aroun 2010,  immaculate from  all aspects of the guests view. All members of staff are well trained and exceptionally nice and friendly. From the minute you drive up to the hotel , doorman, concierge, spa, gym and restaurant staff are most exceptionally well trained and prepared to maintain the hotel¥s outstanding service level .",5,0.9859

Siam Kempinski is my second home in Bangkok. We had stayed over 10 times in this hotel.  All staffs are nicely and helpful. Convenient location next to Siam Paragon. The Swimming pool is huge and clean. Multiple choices of the Breakfast.  We would choose to stay in Siam Kempinski for the next journey.,5,0.9001
"Rooms are luxurious as is the whole hotel. For a family of 4 I would suggest getting two rooms otherwise it may feel cramped.  The pool is perfect for the kids, the pool staff are incredibly attentive and helpful.  The location to all the malls is perfect and within walking distance.",5,0.5915
"All the staff at the Siam Kempinski Hotel were friendly, and room conditioning was the best. I was very impressed to install a bed safety guard for the baby. There is a big beautiful swimming pool. The pool staff always smiled at the children and provided the best service. If I go to Bangkok next time, I will stay in this Siam Kempinski Hotel again. I recommend a family trip with a child.",5,0.9946
"This is a lovely, rather sterile, hotel completely mired by a negligently dangerous lack of access - there is one narrow lane to the hotel, usually blocked, taxis accept rides and then decline because they cannot wait so long in the same line as the shopping center traffic which uses the same small lane - it's like being in a multi-storey car park queue during christmas.  Check this on satellite view.  There is no main road access, no emergency access and is a significant risk for business people or international delegates.  Taxis take at least 30 mins to arrive - because no taxi wants to come here due to the access.  Avoid.  This hotel will make a business traveller late, feel insecure, and frustrated.  Or, just add 30 mins at least to your trip.  On three occasions taxis",1,-0.2728
"The location is so convenient with a bridge to the mall. The playroom is perfect for parents to drop off kids then go for a spa, the babysitters are so friendly and cheerful, kids had great time there.",5,0.9706
Our family trip to celebrate my daughter's birthday in Bangkok Kempinski hotel for 4 nights.  The hotel is next to Paragon Mall and few minutes walk to Siam BTS station. Hotel offer complimentary mini bar; fruit plate and daily newspaper. Comfy bedding with pillow menu and quite air conditioner provided a good sleep at night. Variety of breakfast choices to get start our morning there. Thank you for hotel manger to arrange a birthday cake to my daughter in room. All staff are helpful to solve our little fix problem in room.  I'd highly recommend this hotel to any group or family to stay in Kempinski hotel when visit Bangkok.,5,0.7783
"So it was my graduation ceremony and I stayed here for 2 days, as my university is very close to the hotel. The hotel and the room was beautifully decorated, clean and the service was great. The front office staffs put up balloons in my room, wrote me a congratulatory card and gave me a cake as a surprise. I was touched. The dinner buffet was one of the best in Bangkok as well. I highly recommend this place.",5,0.9695
"Superb hotel for comfort, shopping, and surpisingly also relaxination, in the center of Bangkok.The hotel is next to the huge Paragon shopping center with an abundance of shops, supermarket, and great restaurants. Wh  en you get tired of that, you can come back to the hotel, work out at the gym, relax by the pool, or visit the spa. Perfect amenities for a holiday. Cannot imagine this in the center of this bustling city. Most importantly, visitors will never forget the service and kindness of the staff. 2 outstanding members of the Kempinski team, were Juvarna, lobby manager, who extended very friendly support to my daughter who was ill. Thaks to her my daughter was able to enjoy her holiday. Another employee to be mentioned is Somyos at the pool. He was never far fom the guests.",5,0.9773
Took a couple of tries to set up the stay here due to scheduling issues but it was definitely worth it. The hotel has been recommended by friends so I really wanted to give it a go when transiting through BKK. It has a great outdoor resort pool with space away from other guests and direct access across to Siam Paragon (and the supermarket). Nice luxury hotel which would be great for a short or longer stay ,5,0.8832
"Stayed over a long weekend for my birthday celebration. The hotel was nicely decorated in a classy old style manner. The turn down service provided was nicely executed. Love the daily spread of fresh fruits provided in the room. The breakfast buffet spread was good and what made them a cut above the rest from the other fancy world brand named hotels nearby, is the ability to order from their daily menu, apart from the buffet spread. Plating the dish in a fine dining style was also a nice touch. The free buggy shuttle to nearby malls was great and provided convenience especially if you are traveling with the elderly and young children. Siam paragon is also a zebra crossing away so food choices are not limited. What was disappointing was the toiletries provided. The contents were",4,0.9588

"It was my first time in Bangkok and I had to make sure I always stay in the finest hotels. And I'm glad I stayed at Siam Kempinski.   During my time of booking, I accidentally clicked the bookù button twice via the Discovery Mobile app thus booked the room twice. I called immediately and told them i booked the room twice in error. They were so kind enough to cancel the other room even if I booked the Non Refundable Rate.   Check in was pretty smooth. Hotel lobby was amazing! The pool was great! Breakfast was adequate. Location is perfect! Always consider this area in Siam has terrible traffic. Plan your trip ahead if you stay here. One evening we waited for an hour to get a grab car.   The room we got was just a deluxe room. But we were told we were upgraded. But I don't think",5,0.9735
"Detail and warm services at room.

"Third time coming back! Always feels most welcome everytime we stayed in this hotel. Great experience from check in to checkout. Little gesture counts, thank you for the birthday cake even without a desert requests. The spa was awesome. Resting area after spa was greatly appreciated with fragrance jasmine tea.

"It is at the center of Bangkok connected with all Siam properties Like Siam Paragon, Siam Discovery and other Malls. You cannot want anything more. Everything is at a walking distance from the hotel. The Hotel itself is a super luxury hotel mainly used by Business Travelers. They have a couple of restaurants too although their is no need of it with Siam Paragon at its door. The Gym / Spa area is situated on the 8th Floor has all the facilities that is required. The rooms are most suited for business travelers",5,0.7777
The most dead bar. The service staff girls were talking and giggling amongst themselves loudly. Made no effort to be quiet. No ambience in the bar.  Mezze platter was not to write about. Will not go back .,2,0.9712
This is my fourth stay in Siam Kempinski Hotel Bangkok. All the hotel members were out of my expectations.  The Kid's Club - All the team members were nice and patient. Specially thank you to Jazz and her team to arrange a special birthday party to my son. Very well arranged and please treasure them.  The Baggage Service - When we arrived the hotel. What I heard was òWelcome back' which was warm as going home. They always keep the highest service standards and they have very good communication skills which very willing to help.  The House Keeping team - Always keeps the room clean and tidy with the highest standards. Keep smiling when we met at the corridor.  I will have further reviews on both the restaurants in this hotel very soon.  Please also accept this review as,5,0.9423
Unfortunately I had a bad experience with the reception. For personal reasons I try to extend my stay one more night and I was surprised with the way the handle the request and the outrageous room fees they ask 10 times the standard fees.,2,-0.3096
"This hotel has one of the best location in Bangkok. Right in the center of shopping district, 1 minute walk to one of the largest malls in Bangkok. Room is not the roomiest you would expect for the price and the room I stayed in had a musty smell, something that can happen with bad ventilation. I also had the room with a connecting door and I could clearly hear the people next door even when they were talking normally. I you are thinking of staying here be sure to ask for a room without a connecting door.  The staffs were OK, but could be more friendly and welcoming. For example when I walk past some of the staffs at the lobby (multiple times), they would say nothing and sometime pretended to not make any eye contact. My favorite hotel in the world is the Four Seasons George V",4,0.9893
"This review is for the mums! Came with my husband and 9 month old kid. Was given a crib plus a high chair on request, because it would make feeding my kid easier. Received a set of baby toiletries for him. Also, I left my bottles and pump parts to dry before dinner, and when we returned, housekeeping had laid them out on a piece of linen on the table. They also gave us a bottle of cookies and a plate of fruits every day.  This is our second stay here and I simply love it. We checked out the kid's club but unfortunately our kid was too young. Looks like we need to make another trip next year. :)",5,0.9597

"Despite trying other five star hotels in the city, we still come back to the Kempinski. It's the convenience of being next to Siam Paragon. It's also the lovely breakfast which we still rank as one of the best we've had anywhere in the world. It's also the feeling of a resort in the middle of the city with all the hustle and bustle just steps away. It's also excellent service that we have grown accustomed to.   But over ten years that we have been regularly returning to this hotel, there are two issues that disappoint. First, the property is showing it's age. Fabric in the room have noticeable stains. Wooden furniture have cracks and dents. The overall look starts to feel a bit tired. Second, despite booking directly through the hotel website and using my membership account, we",4,0.9488
"Spent a couple of nights here in early July. The location is fantastic specially if one wants to spend a lot of time at Siam Paragon as it's connected through a walkway with the hotel. That said, I've always stayed around this area or on Sukhumvit and Kempinski was by far the best hotel I've found in Bangkok!  Check in was smooth and we got upgraded to a Club room albeit without the club facilities(?!?!) which basically meant that we had the same sized room but on a higher floor. The person who showed us our room tried his BEST to upsell (repeatedly!) the Club Package to us but we weren't that keen on it since the Club BreakFast room wasn't that big and I prefer to go down to the normal breakfast place as they usually have a larger spread. Moreover we weren't that keen on eating",5,0.9477

"We stayed at Siam Kempinski Hotel for four days in Bangkok. It's an amazing hotel located at the heart of the shopping district. The hotel is connected to Siam Paragon which we could easily walk over through a short sky bridge.  The setup of the hotel is more like a resort as there are pools and large open space in the centre where buildings and rooms surround.   Breakfast is great. There are varieties of egg dishes daily. They are special and delicious. We tried all different kinds during our four-day stay.  Overall service is excellent. Special praise to Katherine at Front office; and Benyapha at the buffet restaurant. They are caring, sincere and helpful.",5,0.9753

Can I please have one of your croissants and a cappuccino. The answer was. No. Sorry Krub we open at 8am. This is why hotels like Kempinski (as beautiful as they are) will go the same way of the Dinosaur. We customers are sick of being told No, eat breakfast now and here. Eat lunch from this hour to this hour. Check in is this or that. Etc. It's time for a new generation of hotel to take over. Bye bye Kempinski. It's was nice while it lasted.",2,0.4771
"Our first formal dinner in Bangkok. The food was delicious and the service was fantastic.

It was beyond our expectations, highly recommended if you visit Bangkok",5,0.9606
