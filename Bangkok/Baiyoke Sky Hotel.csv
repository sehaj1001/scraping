"The hotel room is well equipped and clean and what is very important , the view from hotel room is amazing. Even better view , we had during the breakfast, where we were sitting sit on the terrace and admire Bangkok from the sky :) The breakfast was simply delicious  (huge choice of dishes prepared on highest level). I travel a lot and this breakfast beats the competition:)  And what it the most important, the staff, these people are so nice and helpful, amazing. I really recommend this place. I will back there definitely. ",5,0.9908
"Stayed here for 2 nights while travelling and was very impressed. Its sheer size is amazing and throughout the building it is spotless and shining bright. The views are breathtaking. We stayed on the 31 floor and our room was huge with everything you could want in such a fantastic hotel. There's so much to see inside and out. There's bars and restaurants inside including a lake with fish, theres a golf course and pool too. No need to leave the building. My only gripe is the queues to the lifts. Reception is on the 18th floor then you have to get into another lift to your floor. Other than that it was fantastic. Would recommend a visit ",5,0.9719
"Special mention to Mr. Manolo Papag, who extended multiple assistance to our group, not just within the hotel premises but everything that we needed for our family tour in Bangkok.  Given another chance to visit Bangkok again, i would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone.  With its very spacious rooms, one would feel so relaxed and  comfortable .  Not to mention all the other amenities it offers to its clientele, swimming pool, bar, the SUPERB service its staff in practically all units, as they respond so wuickly to whatever should be fixed, etc.  Congratulations to the warm people of your team and hope to have the same experience on our next visit.

"The view is so impressive. The staff and mini golf were awesome also. But as we exited the elevator onto the level our room was on we were greeted with the a disgusting stale smell, went into our room in the ""space zone"" and the stench was even more pungent than in the hallway, it was a musky stagnate odour that pretty well stained our nostrils after sleeping in it a whole night. It also stole our excitement of the view. The next day upon further examination of the room we noticed 2 big hard crusty stains on the carpet at the full length glass windows, the stains were the size and shape of an adult which creeped us out alot. The air-conditioner vents were coated in dust and mould. My partner accidently dropped her shoe on the floor and noticed a big puff of dust get unsettled by",1,0.8605

I visited baiyoke sky for a leisure trip. Stayed there for 1 day and the hotel did not disappoint us.

"Bayouki can be considered one of the better hotels in bkk alas staff experiences esp from the front desk to housekeeping leaves the guest bewildered. Front desk check in was okay. However asking questions about transport to bts for checkout, led to disputes. Spoke to same staff who checked us in, who and an Indian male colleague stubbornly insisted that golf cart is available and there is no need for book shuttle services, turns out to be false. Front desk should check and know what they are informing the guests. Its really lousy customer service from that indian front desk male staff. Housekeeping was a mixture as well--On the second day, we encountered a professional staff, while as on third day we encountered a surly staff. Room - view was good. Bathtub drainage not working",3,-0.5984

"Booked the hotel with breakfast - the best decision made!  Having the meal on the 77th or 81st floor of the tallest hotel in Thailand was a fantastic experience, enjoying the nice views while eating.  Breakfast selection was very good too.  House guests also have access to the revolving deck on the 84th floor for the 360 deg view of the city.  The hotel location is excellent, near to the train station and many shopping areas.  The hotel also provides one way shuttle service to some touristy places like the Chatuchak weekend market.   Room is spacious and service very good.  Food at the cafe on the 18th floor was very good too.   Will probably stay here again if we return to Bangkok again.",5,0.9835

"Yes, it's one of the highest buildings in Bangkok. So take the elevators to the top, enjoy the view and sleep somewhere else: - The rooms are outdated. - To get to your room you have to take different elevators. Very confusing. - The breakfast consists of a large buffet, but the food is not good and the staff very demotivated so the tables and the floor are dirty. - not a very popular area (many indian restaurants) + near the airport rail link + nice view from the room",2,-0.5898

"Being new at the Baiyoke Sky Hotel, Bangkok, we initially felt nervous thinking how swiftly &amp; properly our check-in formalities could get complete. Having noticed this concern on our face one gentleman named Mr. Kaushik arrived near us and gently asked whether any assistance is required to us. His welcome gesture and proactive nature of assisting was so nice that we all got totally relaxed and found very homely at the reception. He extended all the support and ensured that our requirements are fulfilled. This was really great thing that we found in the hotel.

This hotel is one where my basic needs were met fully. The only thing lacking is the distance to the nearest BTS station. There is free shuttle van to the nearest BTS but it only operates one-way from 10am to 6pm. This means the van will not pick you up from BTS back to hotel.,4,0.2846
The staff is so helpful. I got room upgrade fpr 2 nights. Thank U Lilly and Devi. They help me a lot when i check in. Thank A lot. My favorite is the observation deck. 24 hours shopping n eat @ pratunam so near,5,0.9234

"82 floors ,beautiful but. Hazy skyline.Masdive suites where you could play cricket, ameneties are sloppy as far as tea, coffee or toiletries are concerned.Had to keep asking.Buffet bfast is awesome.Huge and spread over 4 floors 78/79 or 81/82 depending on traffic. The entry to the hotel looks shoddy.the access to the lifts that take you to the lobby is organised.Many groups come here therefore Indian and Chinese dominating. The pool and spa is good. The cleanliness is good My bathroom drain in the shower area clogged on the first use however ....which was sad.room phone didn't work. Friendly concierge Ms Tata and Mr Krishna very helpful and nice...cruise and city visit was well organised and value for money. The shopping area has PLATINIUM market and prathunam wholesale market",4,0.952
"It‚Äôs been ten years since I‚Äôve stayed at Baiyoke Sky Hotel.  I was happy with the room rates.  The room was large and the air con was fabulous. Everything was clean and the bed was very comfortable. The furniture was a bit outdated but functional. Would love to return once the refurbishments of all rooms is complete.  Cafe on the 18th floor was fabulous! Amazing service, very reasonable prices and fantastic food.  Buffet breakfast was just as great as I remembered it to be from 10 years ago. So much choice! Get there early as it gets quite busy by 8am.  Having a Family Mart off the lobby is so convenient.  Only two issues during our stay:  *The advertising film on the outside of the windows really takes away from the experience! We paid extra for space zone rooms only to have",4,0.9898

Thumbs up to staffs who checked us in, Ms. Devi and Ms. Mui. Too early for breakfast as we need to catch a flight so they made special arrangement for our take out breakfast.",5,0.7092
The rooms are spacious but could use additional lights. We had problems checking in. We were told to wait for more than an hour bec the rooms are not yet ready even if it was past 2PM already. I requested for a temporary room so we can all freshen up. I requested for our luggage to be brought to the assigned room but the staff still brought it to the temporary room. I tried explaining but he had hard time understanding. I ended up carrying the luggage myself. There‚Äôs free welcome drinks (I suggest you skip). Free entrance to the revolving deck. Wide variety of foods during breakfast but same set everyday. Good massage/spa and shopping markets around. There are private vans outside that offer trips to different tourist spots. We got a good deal with a man named Mr. Ak. Went to,4,0.9412

"Best place to stay in Bangkok, especially if you are Indian, stay here only as from this hotel, a lane is full of India restaurants including Chotivala :) and shopping market-Indra square. Reception is at 18th floor, same hotel got 83rd floor viewing gallery and if you are staying here, you can visit as many as time you wish this revolving viewing gallery.. All the time someone is available for you to direct to right lift due to high rise building and need to change lift to reach different floors. We spent lot of time on floor 82 &amp; 83 to chat and enjoy late night view. Variety of restaurants including small shopping place at Reception floor.

"The view from the top of the hotel is breathtaking, should  visit both at night and day. The hotel is huge, we spent some time just to figure out what elevator should be taken in order to reach a certain floor ü§≠üôà  The room was spacious, clean, large windows with a beatifull view of the sky towers (41st floor), very comfortable bed. The hotel is close to BTS station from where you can reach international airport or stop to metro station in order to get to Grand Palace or Lumphini Park, for example. Minus: poor wi-fi in the room.",4,0.908
Loved to visit tallest hotel in Thailand. They were celebrating Chinese new year. The front office staff ms supansa and mr koushik were very helpful and upgraded my room. The service was fast and easy.  Reccomend to visit and meet ms supansa and mr koushik,5,0.9273
Really Very Good This Hotel.This is my 3rd time . staff was very helpful and can speak bengali too (mr. koushik) ms. supansa upgraded our roome and gave 5 rooms on same floor. nice rooms and amazing view from 84th floor.,5,0.9211
It was a good experience but we did not have much choice over the room type and receive smoking room (strong smoking smell). But it was ok..some staff were really friendly. We have quite some facilities. For the breakfast we had a very large buffet. Best is the amazing view - i guess there is no toher place to have this view along with the deck.,3,0.9537
"The person name is koushik and ms firoza. They were too friendly with us.even if we ask him to anything about they assist  us as soon as possible. They guide us about city and all information what we needed and that's most helpful thing for us. And our check out time was 10 am and he extended 2 hour extra. And he knows hindi English also.if u come here then meet him,he will give u proper Service and guide.if u r coming from india and u don't know English much then ask him because he know hindi and also from india because sometimes some people have problem with English in abroad.",5,0.5563
"We had a great stay at Baiyoke Sky Hotel, the tallest hotel In Thailand. Thanks to mr. Koushik and ms Kannur who took great care of us. Helped us for check in and check out.  Will definitely come back again.",5,0.9517
"Execilent service by Mr. Koushik and Mr. Manolo.  Lovely service !! Check inn was very helpful , even it was que the guy was very helpful Hotel view is amazing and friendly staff ,  Roof top bar is superb",5,0.9734
Hotel is lovely. Staff is very friendly. Koushik and supansa helped us with everything. Good breakfast. Everything was taken care of. I visited baiyok sky third time. I totally recommend this place. Please do visit.,5,0.9551
"Pros and cons here..... Cons - I think this hotel is a bit overpriced, over-rated and is lacking some TLC (peeling wallpaper, cracks, dodgy paintjobs etc.) Unfortunately the pollution in Bangkok is now such that the view from the top is not actually that good. Although it is free to go to the top if you are a hotel guest. On the plus side staff were fairly friendly, it is centrally located for Pratunam market / skytrain station and was ok for a short-stop before flying out. Room was large and relatively clean and the swimming pool was a useful facility. This is definately not one of the top-end hotel in Bangkok - those would be the Crowne Plaza, Royal Orchid Sheraton, Mandarin Oriental, Millenium Hilton etc. ",3,0.8805
Located in the the main city and heart of Bangkok.  Staff is very professional.  Especially Mr. KOUSHIK AND MS. KRISHNA at the lobby(18th floor). Koushik gave us a very warm welcome and was ready to help all the time. Will surely be back again,5,0.9113
The stay was phenomenal the services were fantastic moreover hospitality was marvelous. Thanks to mr Kaushik and ms Zoya for their amazing response and support. The skyscrapper being the 2nd tallest in bangkok stays sturdy and gives a enormous view of the city including the roads and other skyscrapers too The 84th floor view gives a majestic view too,5,0.9509
Koushik and athitya  Very happy. Good service  Excellent service very good  cooperation by Mr kaushik the GRO of hotel thank you very much Mr kaushik I will come again I will recommend to my friends at least once to stay in hotel,5,0.9689
The hotel was clean and located near a bustling market. The staff was helpful and the rooms are big. The decor was outdated and this is maybe a 3 star hotel and definitely overpriced. We cancelled the second part of our stay because we felt we could find a better hotel for the price.,3,0.8442
"Staff were helpful, they let check in 2 hrs early . Supansa is a beautiful lady with a nice smile. Overall waiting for a great stay in the hotel. Staff explained the process with lot of patience. Free complimentary access to the 77th &amp; 82 nd floor view point .",5,0.9694
Great Food!!! The place is great. So many spots to take pictures to. You get a bird's eye view of bangkok. Definitely would recommend this activity. We were not able to witness sunset during that time although we booked the 5-7pm slot,4,0.9357
"We chose this hotel because of its great location in the city center and proximity to the Airport Rail Link and Water Taxi. The rooms are clean, but a bit outdated. The breakfast on the 82nd floor offers a huge choice and is definitely worth it. I found it very useful that my luggage could be stored for 2 weeks after check-out - great service! The only negative point I have to mention is the unstable wifi connection. Last but not least the view from the room is really nice! We got a big room with an amazing panorama window. Thanks again to Supansa, Yada!",5,0.9833
"I booked 2 rooms in the hotel and specifically mentioned to have the rooms on High Floors but As we reached there the problems we faced were :  1. The staff asked us to pay 15000INR or 200USD which was not mentioned anywhere during the booking...We managed to give them that. But because of this the money got mixed up and we lost 100USD(not their fault but if they didn't ask for it..we might had them).  2. They didn't even prepare the rooms for us. We haven't got rooms on High Floors.  3. We requested Single King Size beds...they didn't fixed that for us and asked us to take rooms on different floors.  4.The staff was soo rude i can't even tell, they treated us as they are doing some favour on us to let us stay in the hotel....I never saw such a staff in a highly priced hotel.  I",1,-0.8807
Had a superb view from Sky zones and was always greeted with a smile by staff. Had no issues during my stay and would definitely stay again. Please do mind that this building is a public attraction and the crowds in the early morning and afternoon is big and can get frustrating waiting for lifts. Other than this everything is good. Highly recommended,5,0.9392
"First stay at baiyoke sky hotel. The room was clean and they gave me free upgrade to family room which is very spacious room. The breakfast was amazing with a lot of choices of food. The staff also kind and friendly.   But unfortunately, the hotel interior is old and creppy. And annoyong experience during my stay was slow check process which takes another 15 until 20 minutes to handling 1 guest while the other 4-5 star hotels only take 5 minutes for check in process.",3,0.9325
"Just don't expect you are dining at a luxury hotel. The hotel is at a night market and the entrance at the ground floor is really local.  We had to take the lift from G/F to Hotel lobby on 18/F or to 19/F to redeem our buffet tickets reserved online. Then took another lift to 77/F and changed again to another lift to 82/F.  However, there were always staff around to tell you where to go and you wouldnn't get lost. There were really a lot of visitors going to different floors for different activities. When we reached our dining floor 82/F, to our surprise, it was not crowded at all. Every party was allocated a table by the window with city view. Food was acceptable for the price charged. After dinner, we walked upstairs to 84/F with a revolving viewing gallery for a whole city",4,0.7758
My husband and I stayed here as it was a treat for my birthday. We stayed on 68th floor and the views were amazing.   We were upgraded to a suite which was large and clean although a bit dated and not luxurious.   There are a lot of tourists visiting this hotel for the views and dinner and sometimes felt like being in a bit like Disneyland with people taking selfies and photos everywhere you looked.  The cocktail bar on 83rd floor was reasonably priced but had no atmosphere and it was fun playing golf on the 17th floor terrace.   The pool area was clean but again there were people constantly taking photos so not relaxing at all.  I am glad I had the experience of staying here but after a couple of nights the constant use of lifts and tourists I was glad to move on. ,4,0.9592
"I didn't stay at hotel but had experience at Chinese restaurant on 79th floor, Stella Palace restaurant. It's quite confusing when you get to hotel building and you must have ticket to get to 79th floor. However in my case we had reservation by hotel executive so no tickets for our group. For line buffet, it's good, very variety, Chinese food, Peking duck, seafood, stir fried, cook section many to choose. They have private room if you come in a small group. Most of tour group sit in dining area. Nice view on 79th floor for sure. The gimmick that I like was there are small food cart come to your private room and serve you. This is quite unique, rarely see in restaurant. Khun Suthep, our server is super with service mind and recommend us with all the things. It's worth to try and",4,0.959
The view is nice but personally feel the buffet is not worth it. It is expensive and have to change 3 lift only can go in and out. Time wasted for waiting. The food variety is not much. It is kind of 360 view for Bangkok city. ,3,-0.6596
My girlfriend and I recently spent 4 nights here and overall I must say I was quite impressed.  We stayed in a Superior Suite in the Space Zone on a very high floor (can't quite remember what exact number floor but it was 70 something...).  The room was very spacious and although there were some carpet stains near the window it was clean and cozy enough - especially for what you are paying.  9/10 of the staff were also great and always had a nice smile and said hello.   Breakfast on the 78 or 81st floor was also great - we preferred the 81st floor as the egg station cook seemed better lol   We didn't really experience any major delays with the lift system either as they give priority to guests so if you are ever waiting just find a staff member and they will take you to the,3,0.9882
"The building is a beacon, towering over everything. The rooms, well, outdated decor, small TVs and nothing special. Was told it was one of the better hotels in the area, I didn‚Äôt see it. Yes, it is an iconic building, and rooms are under $100 a night, but that is par for the coarse in the area. Though I paid for the room on credit card, still had to provide a 3000 baht deposit in cash. Just really nothing special, though the bellhops are very eager to help (once you get into the hotel) and it is convenient to a bustling area with malls and night markets within walking distance. For the money, I‚Äôd pay a bit more and stay at a western style hotel which would be more modern. ",2,0.8825
"My family and I book this hotel for our last day in Bangkok, certainly love it!! The room is spacious and we had the 1 big bed and 1 single bed so we can sleep comfortably for 2 adults and 2 children. The breakfast has so many choices and yummy too. And we can see Bangkok nightlife from the 84th floor.  The staffs also very helpful. Thank you Ms. Supansa and Ms. Devi who had helped us during check in speaking in Bahasa üòä",4,0.9599
"the hotel room is old but its pretty good for the price. the service is very good, i got a nice receptionist named devi from indonesia. the bad part is there is so many elevator and it makes me confused. but overall its pretty decent",4,0.9286
"Baiyoke was really great hotel and have a great service too, they have minimarket inside hotel near lobby and open 24/7 , the view from our room was amazing, the have night market just in front of the hotel, you can walk 10 min to pratunam market and platinum mall, 15 min by tuk tuk to Big C supermarket, breakfast have so many choice , i guarantee just stay at hotel already enough they have everything, the staff so nice and helpfull, will back for sure",5,0.9677
I have visited the baiyoke Hotel..!! It was a tremendous pleasure to stay over here and Ms Supanaa Is very co-operative. And too much helpful staff which was first time i have faced in my entire foreign destination   Thanks a lot..!!!,5,0.8902
"A decent hotel, room was big though with limited stuff, so felt bit empty on 1 side. Bathroom separated from toilet, good with the separation and both could be used at once by 2 of  you :), something helpful when you have to fasten up on things with little time. View of Bangkok from observatory and revolving deck is good and its entry complimentary for hotel guests Breakfast buffet spread is goos overall, but divided on each spread table for 1 cuisine among Indian, Continental, Japanese, etc. So respective spread of each is limited, Indian food as per their interpretation of it, but overall still good and other cuisine breakfast - worth a try",4,0.897
"Staff hotel is so great,  she is so helpfull.  She give me a good room with big window in the highest floor at 62nd Fl.  And allow me to check in earlier at 12.30. Many informations i got from her about hotel facilities.  Thank you",5,0.9107
