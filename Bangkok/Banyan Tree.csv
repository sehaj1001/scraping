"I stayed at the  Banyan Tree in March 2020. The Hotel facilities were excellent, but the staff were another level again. I was after a particular Jade carving in Bangkok. Golffy and his staff at the front desk rang all over Bangkok in pursuit of this item. They provided pictures to me from multiple sites but to no avail. Not to be discouraged they eventually found the piece in Chang Mai, and had it shipped to the Banyan Tree. By this stage I had left the Country, so they arranged freight and Insurance and sent the parcel to my home address. What can I say, BRILLIANT..Gollfy, Thi, Pan, Benz, Boyo GREAT STUFF See you next time..",5,0.8803
"Had a really good night at Moon Bar. Killer view, great jazz vibe and excellent drink. We had Vertigo Sunset and Dragon Ball, well recommended by Ohm. Thanks to Ohm's excellent service, we also got an unblocked view table. You definitely should come here to experience this.",5,0.9577
"Eight of us stayed for 3 nights in March 2020, excellent facilities with the staff going above and beyond expectations. Golffy at the entry made a large number of calls on our behalf and was extremely helpful, along with assistance from Thi, Pan, Benz and Boyo.  Great team and thanks very much. Special mention also for Suksan in the gym, stretched several of us out and engaged and taught some basic Thai boxing skills to others in our group. Suksan is the ideal employee and makes all guests feel very welcome.",5,0.9787

"The staff in this hotel are super helpful and always make an effort to go the extra mile for you to enjoy the best stay during your trip.  Being a vegetarian, it didn't stop me from enjoying scrumptious food provided by the hotel as they made an effort to cater to my dietary restrictions, especially at breakfast.",5,0.9701
We stayed there as a group. The hotel provided great service. The food in the restaurants within the hotel were fantastic! Location of hotel is within walkable disrance to shopping centres. Will definitely choose to stay there again when we visit Bangkok!,5,0.8997
"Banyan tree was the greatest hotel experience I've had in Bangkok! You are always greeted as if you are family and they personally deliver the best customer experience I have ever seen. Special shout out to John who spent a lot of time getting to know us, checking in on our experience, and even joining our networking session. The food is remarkable, the area is safe, and they always have the best recommendations on what to do / where to go. Thank you for an amazing stay at Banyan Tree!",5,0.9846
"This hotel and its staff are truly amazing...  We will be forever grateful for all the help that was provides by the staff of Banyan tree Bangkok. They helped us to get home by arranging our flight to go 5 days earlier.  Off course were sad that we had to leave earlier, because the hotel is gorgeous, the room was amazing, the food delicious and the staff so very friendly. But with the current situation (COVID-19) we had to get home.  We were very afraid that it wouldn’t be possible for us to get home, so the concierge staff (shout out to Mr Jackie Chan &amp; Mr Nueng) did everything they could to get us on an earlier flight.  And they got it done!  We hope we can come back next year, we wish everyone of the staff all the best.  ♥️  Meike &amp; Jord",5,0.9844
"We had an amazing experience during our Honeymoon stay at the Banyan Tree n Bangkok.  It was our first stop on our Honeymoon to Thailand, and was amazing the.  The Room was awesome and they brought us a special Honeymoon desert on our first night, the staff was extremely helpful, pool was amazing and Breakfast buffet was probably the best we had during our entire stay in Thailand.  We had some different ideas of what to do during our short stay in Bangkok and everyone at the Concierge station was extremely helpful, especially Pan.  Pan helped arrange a taxi for us for an all day excursion to a floating market and Railway market, as well as recommendations on how to get to different areas of the city for things we wanted to do and what we should expect to pay for transportation.",5,0.9819
Beautiful and extremely well maintained property in Sathorn.      In terms of location it’s an easy walk (10 minutes) to Lumphini MRT about 15-20 to Saladaeng BTS but Grab is also an easy option.    The staff are being very proactive with cleaning standards and precautions given the C19 virus and that was extremely reassuring.   The rooms are very large and comfortable.    Plenty of options on the TV if you want to stay in AND inroom dining is very responsive and the quality/quantity were excellent.      The bed and linens were high quality and allowed for lots of much needed rest.    There was an extensive pillow menu.  Water was replenished daily as was the coffee/tea.    Fresh fruit was also replenished daily.    Club level staff were extremely well trained and the offerings,5,0.99
"Banyan Tree Bangkok has a great facility with impeccable service. First thing that i noticed that they have notification that their elevators are sanitized every hour. That is very important considering the current situation we are facing. Great welcome from the hotel manager, Mr John and his team as we traveled in a group! Kudos !  Enjoyed my breakfast by the open air concept with fish pond. Very zen feeling. It is small area, an extension of the breakfast area. Rooftop bar is a place to go a night and enjoy the night breeze with a glass of gin and tonic or maybe glasses. Stayed there for 3 nights and their turn-down services were creative. First night, we received a hand-made baby turtle, second night it was a postcard and on the last night was my favorite Lavender face mist.",5,0.9839
"We started our trip to Thailand with a short stay in Bangkok and we chose to stay at Banyan Tree Hotel and I'm so glad we did! I did so much research on where to stay for our first time in Bangkok and it was a hard choice between location (near the historic sites we wanted to see) and luxury...clearly luxury won. I picked this hotel based on its great reviews, the breakfast, the closeness to public transit, and the rooftop bar. Spoiler, we were too drained at the end of the day to even consider leaving our room to visit the bar...maybe next time!  This hotel did not disappoint!! Upon check in we were greeted with a tasty welcome drink (I think it was butterfly pea flower iced tea?). Our super late night arrival was not a problem and check in was prompt.   We got upgraded to a",5,0.9734
I had a great time here.   I chose this place on my anniversary with my husband. Dinner such as beef was very good and above all the staff service was great.  He took many pictures at nice spots.  I will visit here again.  Thanks Benz!,5,0.9544
"My friend surprised me with a late night meal at this beautiful rooftop restuarant.  The views are breathtaking... pure serenity.  The food, absolutely perfect! Everything was prepared to perfection and the presentation was amazing!  Our service was the best I've ever recieved any place.   [Covid-19] from the moment we entered,  the checked our temperature and provided us with hand sanitizer. Mr. Lak was our waiter, he catered to our needs, I have an egg allergy and he made sure that I didnt have anything that had egg in it-  I asked for the cake dessert though....because you only live once. Lol.  At the end of our meal, Mr. Lak, Miss Aom, Mr. Ah surprised me with a birthday song while playing ukuleles! How awesome is that!! I highly recommend this place while visiting Bangkok.",5,0.9927

"Enjoyed a lovely evening celebrating my friend's  birthday.  Extra precautions taken on the wake of Covid. Upon entry our temperature was taken, and hand sanitizer was provided before entering the dining area. Lak was our server, he was knowledgeable and answered menu questions. He also asked if there were allergies in the group, which there are. We enjoyed the 4 course menu. The food was delicious. Service was beyond extraordinary.  From helping with photos to singing, acknowledging food allergies in the group and helping with photos, even singing happy birthday to my friend. Everyone was beyond kind and accommodating.  I would definitely recommend for a romantic evening or just a nice,calm relaxing dinner.  Exceptional views and exceptional service. Thank you also to Ms. Aom",5,0.9933
"What a special treat for our last night in Thailand. Beautiful food, amazing views, peaceful atmosphere and great service from Lek and Aom. Very much recommended. The menu is very fish heavy, but I had the duck and it was delicious. Great cocktail menu too. Expensive, but worth the treat.",5,0.9823
"request to postpone the booking due to travel ban due to thailand immigration . basically just got a reply ‘ greeting from banyan tree’ and then nil help. customer service is literally non existent, after 3-4 messages to and from , end up asking us to contact agoda or we were told we would be charged anyway.

"I revisit this hotel after several year! It is still great! One bed room suite is large, bath room is amazing! The club lounge was excellent for breakfast / tea! Although location is near BTS, it is great for joggers because hotel is near famous running park at Bangkok",5,0.9576
"OH MY GOD! Where do I start??? I did not want to leave the hotel at all. The bed, the hospitality, the room, the pool, bars and restaurants, the gym, sauna and steam room were all amazing! A great night market and streets with bars were within walking distance from the hotel as well as the public trains to get further in downtown. They even have a tuk-tuk to bring you to the train station so you do not have to walk that 5 minutes. Overall, best experience in Bangkok!",5,0.9605

"My wife and I stayed at the Banyan Tree Bangkok for 4 nights in a Club level room at the end of February and have nothing but praise for the hotel and all staff we came into contact with. The hotel is spotlessly clean as you would expect and we ate breakfast each morning in the lower lobby restaurant as we found the choice and quality of food on offer to be excellent. The Vertigo Bar is something else and the views are spectacular. We found all staff to be courteous and professional but would just like to mention a few; Suleemas and Chonthicha in housekeeping who left our room pristine each day,  Sugar and Boom in the Club Lounge were magnificent - always smiling and ready with a refill, they really went the ""extra mile"" to assist in making our stay that little bit special.

Staff was more Friendly towards other guests. They were helpful but we didn’t feel too welcomed there. The room was spacious but simple. Room amenities were basic but doable. The bed was comfortable. We did have some good night sleep during our stay. The breakfast was just alright. I did expect better as it’s a Banyan Tree probably which is pretty much on the same level as Waldorf Astoria and Park Hyatt.,4,0.9781

The rooms themselves are clean, modern, comfortable.  Then of course, you have the Rooftop Bar, maybe one of the best in all BKK.",5,0.9485
"My husband and I stayed in this hotel for 5 nights. We were well looked after the whole time. All the staff were extra friendly and went the extra mile from the moment our taxi arrived at their front door. We were always greeted with smiles and the staff at the concierge were extra helpful - Golffy, Jackie, Korn, Pan and Ben2. Golffy was especially good as he suggested great excursions, restaurants and spas. It helped that his English was also very good. The room was lovely, clean and modern and we had all the amenities required. We were gifted with special promotions during our stay such as a 2 for 1 massage. The spa facilities and the massages where amazing - we would highly recommend a full body massage.   We enjoyed breakfast everyday which included a delicious mix of Thai",5,0.9926

What an amazing stay in the serenity club room.  Every single staff member provided an excellent level of service. We dined in the vertigo the food and view were amazing.

The highlights of our stay were definitely having dinner not once but twice at Saffron restaurant. Where we experienced fine Thai food and amazing hospitality from Mark who really took care of us well. Travelling with our daughter was made easy each step of the way by helpful staff from the breakfast team to great little touches within housekeeping who acknowledged her presence throughout the suite and especially from Mr Wat at concierge for entertaining our daughter.

"About staying here!!! Gorgeous, high-end hotel!!  We flew round trip from Phuket - I’d actually gotten a really good package deal for the flight &amp; 2 nites accommodations in a club level King suite - about $735 for 2 people!  We are hotel snobs &amp; this club level suite was pretty sweet!! It has a very nicely stocked mini bar, there was fresh fruit in a fruit bowl on the living room table with a menu to tell you what kind of fruit it is!  The bed was very comfortable, the room service was delicious!!  I’d actually chosen this hotel for the rooftop bar &amp; it was crowded, but great with a to die for skyline view!

"Banyan Tree Hotel is very luxurious and our bedroom on the 26th floor is really comfortable with a beautiful bathroom and a bathtub with a view however...I am not particularly taken all in all! First the lobby area is very anonymous with lots of people coming and going (tourists and onlookers and guests) so feel not personal. Second I find very strange that they just check you in and give you the key of the bedroom...we had to ask where were the lifts! The pool area is lovely unfortunately there wasn’t any space available so my idea to relax by the pool didn’t work out! In the end, to be frank there is really nothing around here: few hotels, few embassies and a lovely park not far away and...this is it! So a part few things the hotel has no faults but I am not so sure I want to",4,0.4762

Nothing too much trouble for anyone, polite, respectful and gracious. All the public areas so calm and restful after the hustle and bustle of Bangkok. John the general manager greeted us and many visitors personally and he should be proud of the attitude of all of his staff.  Plenty of restaurants and bars to choose from all, to the same high standard. A couple of specific mentions.

"After very unfortunately contracting gastroenteritis during my travels before arriving at the hotel, the hotel staff provided me with great assistance in first sending a nurse to visit me in my room upon arrival, and then directing me and offering transport to the local hospital for consultation with a doctor. The following day when I was still bound to my room as I was still too unwell to attend the breakfast meal, the hotel staff contacted me to arrange for someone to bring to me a very light breakfast (which was very necessary!) to my room. In addition to this, I was also given a bouquet of flowers and a handwritten get well soon card along with it!  I'm not usually one to leave reviews generally, but this act of service truly blew me away, and this level of customer service",5,0.7641

"A must in Bangkok is coming for cocktails on a rooftop, but if you have the time and funds for a dinner, Vertigo is the best place.  Dinner was very good, I had a very tasty cocktail and my main dish was a great pasta with shrimp, crab and chorizo. Every flavour was so complementary, I loved it! If you have room, dont miss out on the Lychee sherbet, so tasty and light.   All of that topped with an amazing view and great service, special thanks to Mie for such an attentive service! Can’t recommend enough.",5,0.994

"First visit to Bangkok, and booked the Banyan Tree because it looked amazing on the website..! It did not disappoint..! Booked a one bedroom suite, arrived early in the morning so a few hours before check in time, which didn’t cause any problems for us or the extremely polite attentive staff, they booked us in and upgraded our room.!! We were upgraded to the Lavender suite..! Which I can only describe as amazing and a once in a lifetime experience unless you play premier league football.!!! The suite was massive, the views were spectacular..! The hotel staff are the politest people in the world, the hotel standard is fantastic. The hotel is very well located, less than a five minute walk to the nearest Metro station which is so easy and cheap to use to get you around the city. ",5,0.9596

"So we were originally looking to stay at the Shangri La hotel in Bangkok. But luckily they were fully booked so we ended up at the Banyan tree.   As soon as we stepped out of the car the staff were all warm and welcoming. Everyone here is so attentive and can't do enough for you.  We were lucky to get a room on the 58th floor. What fab views!! The Vertigo restaurant and moon bar are accessible from the 59th floor. Beware though you actually have to walk up to the 61st floor. So anyone with bad knees may struggle! Views are fantastic. Pricey but nice.  We were half board so ate dinner at the Saffron restaurant twice. Food was great. Although you could argue service was a little slow, you need a minimum of 2 hours for a 3 course meal. But again staff were awesome!  A little shout",5,0.9674
"Highly recommend to book this hotel and especially with club lounge room. They serve very nice breakfast in club lounge, but best is all day free flow of beer, lunch and nice evening drinks with sparkling wine etc. We had great service in all restaurants ib hotel but especially in club lounge  in the 19th floor and club lounge person called Boom, he was the BEST! Cood service with excellent tips for Bangkok, highly recommend to book this hotel and if you can have Boom serving you in club lounge, you will.. he will make your holiday for next level 😎.",5,0.994

"Very nice city hotel in a central location.  We had an arrangement in a 100 sqm one bedroom suite. Great room, great facilities. With steam bath, espresso machine, pillow menu etc. But the best are the people, Mr. Badminton from the massage team, Mr. Wat from the bell desk (best Bangkok guide) and last but not least Miss Mita from the check in. We felt welcome  ,  Thank you  Try one of the set menu dinner at Saffron restaurant und the cruise ship",5,0.9382
I heard great things about this hotel but I was pretty disappointed and wouldn't go back. I thought because it was a pricey room our bed would of been made properly but the sheets hanging out over the floor and creases in the sheets looked like someone already been on the bed before us.,3,0.714
"We had a wonderful stay at Banyan tree Bangkok for 3 days &amp; 3 nights. Right from the airport pickup to drop, the entire service was perfect. In fact, we ended up spending most of our time at hotel and its properties than visiting the city!  Room was clean and spacious. I really liked the special fragrance for each day in the form of candles and incense sticks.  In-room dining service is fantastic and very timely. Loved the setup everytime we ordered food.  Kudos to all the staff members for doing a great job. From the front desk to room service to restaurant &amp; bar, everybody was at their best almost all the time. They'll greet you with a smile while serving or  even if you're passing by them.  We also enjoyed the dinner at Vertigo restaurant with a nice unblocked view of",5,0.9926
