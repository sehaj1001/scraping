"My wife and I would like to say thank you to k.puynoon sales wedding manager of pullman grande sukhumvit. Our wedding day, once in a lifetime, that day could not complete without helps from k.puynoon.

However , i chose pullman due to the best service from wedding sales manager (k.puynoon).  It is not easy to say everything in one letter , but my wife and i would like to show our feeling for thank you to k.puynoon for helping us creating the best day in our life.  Before our wedding , my wife texted to k.puynoon a lot , many times , almost always , my wife talked to k.puynoon more than me lol. What i think?

"With a plethora of hotel options in Bangkok, I have always wanted to stay at Pullman Grande and it's been long in my must stay list. Unfortunately, my experience was lackluster and disappointing which I will elaborate further.  I arrived at the hotel around noon, and highly appreciated that my room was ready, unsurprisingly due to Covid-19 that arrivals were low. Check in was done by K'Yui, who was pleasant however doesn't seem too pleased doing her job, with no smile. I didn't feel welcome by anyone upon arrival, aside from the porter who assisted with my bag. Oh, and did I mention with low guest arrivals, I had to call Pullman touch on the phone to ask where is my bag after settling down in my room?  I was assigned the room I booked, staff did not bother to learn that it was",3,-0.2399
"My wife and I stayed for our second time here in two years.   Our most memorable visit.   Hotel staff is professional and very helpful and kind spirits.   Many nice memories of time spent with them, whether in Lounge, or in Restaurant.   Cleaning staff excellent, and attentive.   We were particularly grateful for the medical assistance provided for spouse who suffered from a sinus infection.   Medical doctor was called and quickly attended to his new patient.   Likewise, the staff kindly sent flowers to the room and inquired on health matters.   We will miss the staff here, too many to name directly, but a few - Jay, BuG,  May, Fah, Nick,and Punch;  also the ever attentive concierge staff, and wonderful waitresses in the Flourwor and our special friends in the Inblu staff and",5,0.9693

Pullman is a very convenient hotel located in the heart of Bangkok. The room is very comfortable with a good standard of cleanliness.

"Stayed here for three nights. Spacious and well appointed rooms, close to Asok BTS. Hotel is immaculate and staff are very friendly. However, it is a little over priced- there are better 5 star properties for less money, it is starting to be a little date and the pool area is small and very shaded due to multiple high-rise buildings surrounding it. This is a good quality hotel and a strong base for exploring Bangkok. ",4,0.9286
"Thank you Pullman Hotel Grande Sukhumvit for the pleasant stay. We were pleased to receive an early check in after a red-eye flight. Luckily we were able to grab breakfast while we waited briefly for our room to be prepared. The breakfast consists of a vast spread - there are western, asian and indian options including freshly cut tropical fruit and freshly squeezed juices.   We enjoyed the service provided by Tom and Pop at the front desk/concierge. Everything was possible for them. They gave us god suggestions for places to eat at, places to shop at and always checked in with us when we returned from our day about Bangkok.  As for the room - spacious, very clean and comfortable. There were various lights in the room so one could have it as bright or as dim as they wanted. The",4,0.9768
"I had a Deluxe King room, high up just below the club floors. From first entry, the staff were friendly, smiling and very helpful. Room was spacious, something the innovative bathroom (glass walled) design emphasised.  I'm unusual, the second thing I do in Bangkok after checking in is collect the scooter I'll use. The Pullman is in an excellent position for this transport, and the parking is easy and friendly. And the hotel is at a main junction of both metro systems, so there are always choices to get places. TOP TIP; Get to know Mr Trai (curiously they give him a name badge of Tong), the head concierge, and his team; all are caring, helpful and a font of knowledge.

Having lived and travelled in Thailand for more than 15 yrs I think I am more than qualified to speak of Hotel standards.Our latest trip was to the Pullman Grande Soi 21 Sukumvi t Bangkok.We pre booked club room as was my Daughter's Birthday and sea Food Buffet.Little did we know Management had decided to Cancel one of the nights that we were due to stay and the club room was being moved from one floor to another.Resulting in a debacle where the food supplied was not of the best as my wife is a Vegetarian we asked if they could rustle something up for her.They did return 1hr later with SomTam which was far too spicy so inedable.the spirits were Vodka Gin Whiskey and Jack Daniels Red - White wine which ran out pretty much immediately also bottled beers were in short supply.When,2,-0.2887

"I booked this hotel because I was told they have babysitting services and I wanted to hedge my risk in the event I wanted to have a couple massage with my husband (eventually we didn't use the babysitter because our baby was sticky).   The checking in was smooth and I requested for a non smoking room. However, when I entered the room there was cigarette stench filling the entire room that I immediately requested for a change of room, which the hotel gladly replaced for me. The room had a big bath tub which was basically used by my baby for her water playtime every morning before breakfast and nighttime before bedtime and she really enjoyed the tub activity a lot.

"I stayed in this hotel on two occasions over the Christmas and new year period. As I frequently travel with my job I asked to stay on the business floors and was very impressed with the service which was far better than service I've received in hotels at twice the cost.  Firstly the front of house team were incredibly well trained and very friendly whilst maintaining a professional customer relationship.  They have an executive check in lounge for the business rooms which are worth the extra money for the view, rooms and privacy.  What really blew me away though was the friendliness of the team, nothing was too much trouble.....in particular the hotel manager actually lending me one of his personal items as I didnt have mine to hand for a studio session I had booked.  I can not",5,0.96

"It is not often that I get the chance to review a property twice. Since the first stay in 2013 (it was The Grand Millennium Sukhumvit back then), I had the chance to stay here at the Pullman Bangkok Grande Sukhumvit a couple of times and I think it is time to give it an updated review.  Location is excellent with close proximity to the BTS Asok and MRT Sukhumvit stations. Shopping mall, Terminal 21, is just across the street and that's the place where you can practically get everything - food, fashion, supermarket, pharmacy, money changer, cinema, massage, etc. There are also convenient stores (eg. 7-11) and restaurants next to and behind the hotel.

We stayed in executive room with club access 3 nights at Movenpick 15 and 3 nights at Pullman Grande and experienced distinct differences beyond expectation. At Movenpick, the brakes were applied after the first drink whist Pullman Grande Club Lounge staff welcome guests to help themselves to alcoholic drinks, all with big smiles in a relaxed surround on 24th floor with breathtaking views of Bangkok skyline. And the canapes are among the best I've enjoyed in my extended years of travel. A big thank you to Fan,Paunch,JJ, May, Jay and Bug for your warm welcome.

They were very professional and cooperative. The Chinese banquet were delicious.   After the reception party, we spent a night at the hotel.

I had the pleasure to stay in the Pullman Asoke shortly before Christmas and just after New Year each time for 3 days upon my arrival in and before my departure from Bangkok. Both stays were absolutely faboulous. All staff in this hotel are super friendly and professional: from the bellman who welcomes you in your taxi over the ladies and their supervisor at reception and all bar and restaurant staff to especially Ms Jay and her team in the executive club lounge. I had the privilege of accessing my room already upon my early arrival at 8 am (thanks to the early arrival of Thai Airways and the calm traffic) and during my 2nd stay I was offered a generous late check-out. The beds in this hotel are super comfy. I always sleep extremely well in this hotel. And the service in the,5,0.9652

"Liked: spacious rooms, great location, request for interconnecting rooms was honoured, early check in, friendly and helpful service, breakfast buffet was amazing, nice pool, lovely big bath in room, very kid friendly.  Disliked: carpet in rooms and hallways a little worn, but this is a small thing.  We loved our stay and would stay again.",5,0.8908
"Prior to arrival I contacted the hotel to explain we were celebrating an anniversary and requested a nice room on a high floor. On arrival we were told there was a shortage of double rooms so we were allocated a room with two single beds. Despite saying twice that we didn't want a smoking room, that's what we got and it stank. We were moved to room 2008 which was still a twin but with a poor view. The room itself was tatty, the pillows were worn out and the bath took 40 minutes to fill. Breakfast was good, staff were very friendly, the bell boys we're extremely helpful but there are nicer hotels at this competitive end of the market. Essentially, a city centre hotel that's a bit worn out. Sadly, not one we'd return to. ",3,0.4094

"A review written here by member ""Beaujae"" is completely accurate of our experience here.  Everything mentioned from the terrible value breakfast to the substandard facilities is perfectly explained in their review.    I have visited numerous 5 star hotels and the Pullman does not measure up.    For the price range, I had a few Bangkok hotels in mind and opted for the Pullman to try something a little different.  Check out Beaujae's review and you'll see why other hotels at this price range are a much better option.",2,-0.7689
"I'm a Accor platinum member and we recently booked two rooms for 5 nights at this property, which has an excellent location providing access to a local MRT station and very close proximity to Sukhumvit Rd. We were overall happy with the broader hotel services; and our main engagement was with the staff in the Executive Club lounge where we had breakfast, evening food and drinks. All club lounge staff, were welcoming, warm and friendly and offered excellent service, however we experienced some minor issues which were clearly due to under staffing, however given the circumstances they all did an excellent job, and I do acknowledge that New Year's Eve is one evening very difficult to manage staff levels.  The Club Lounge manager Miss Karnjana Pongkorn leads her team by example and",5,0.8737

"I usually stay (and collect points) at another 'big-chain hotel' group, however this time I decided to try the Accor group for something different. As it was over the (inflated-room rate) New Years period I chose a Pullman because it was in the lower end of the upper-price range 5-star (but still expensive by Bangkok standards).  Heres what they say on the Internet about Pullman hotels Tailor-made services and exclusive offers at the best prices. High-end hotels for business or leisure - which sounds promising, right?  Location. 5/5 Excellent!  Close to MTR and BTS which means getting about without getting stuck in Bangkok traffic! Also easy from airport by train. Take train to Makkasan then MTR one stop to Sukhumvit. Easy! Close to Healthland Spa which is a must for visiting",2,-0.2689
"One word: Amazing. Everything was perfect! Excellent arrangement! Our suite is fantastic, so pleasant. Thanks for the great team of staff served us patiently! Especially Jay, she is very professional and caring. She leads her teammate, May, Bug, Punch, JJ and Fah. They are so helpful and friendly. They prepared everything seamlessly. It made the stay extra pleasurable. Thanks again for Jay introducing the massage and spa In the hotel to us, we enjoyed the Gold rush scrub and aroma massage in the evening. It was totally unexpected. Last but not least, the executive lounge is great! It locates on the 24th floor. Certainly, the executive guests  can enjoy the complimentary service there from 06:30 - 22:30. ",5,0.8518
