MUST STAY! the picture of the hotel can not compare to being there in person. The hotel is AMAZING and the staff are excellent and go above and beyond to greet you and make sure your needs are met. we were immediately greeted and checked in and personally escorted to our room. our room was a 2 bedroom with a small living room . the beds were the most comfortable we have slept on the entire stay (we stayed in 3 hotels prior to this one). you can order room service from an IPAD --- just amazing. Make sure you get breakfast included with your stay....its delicious and something for everyone. we also got a cab and went to a nearby mall where they had all you needed and then some...quite the experience.  BAR NONE the best hotel stay. we will stay here when we go back.,5,0.9757
"Having been to Bangkok maybe 10-15 times and stayed in a lot of different mid range - high end hotels, the Lancaster has to be the best overall and the best value for money.   You walk in to the foyer and the atrium is spectacular. You are greeted by all the wonderful staff. You are provided with a welcome drink before being shown to your room.   My executive suite 713 was huge and very well appointed / equipped with everting I needed. Just simple things like toiletries, note pad, fruit, stocked fridge, tea, coffee, USB plugs in the right places, an iPad for ordering food, an safe thatâ€™s easy to use with internal power socket, rainfall shower etc etc etc... everything is just top quality!   The hotels facilities are great with a nice pool, hot tub, gym, pool bar, spa (had a",5,0.9903
"When I arrived at this hotel my expectations were very high having read previous reviews.I can tell you that I was not disappointed.When we arrived at the hotel, I decided to upgrade our room to Club Lancaster which gives you access to the Club room with additional privileges such as afternoon tea and evening cocktails.My partner and I felt very special and we were well looked after by Tian and Fongbeer(I hope I have got those names correct).Everything in this hotel was luxurious,the bedroom,the Siam Brasserie(we loved the breakfast buffet) and we also enjoyed the Lancaster Bar on the ground floor.All the staff were very polite and helpful.My partner and I will make this hotel our first choice when we hopefully return to Bangkok in the near future.",5,0.9612
"We have just returned from Thailand as the Covid 19 storm hit. We were at the hotel for several days as we changed our plans. They were absolutely superb from first to last. They booked cars, and flights, and got us to where we wanted to be and when we wanted to be there. All with good humour and grace. The hotel  is and remained spotless and a real haven.  Added to that are the usual areas of praise; beautiful rooms, great food, brilliant staff and very good value. This is a truly superb hotel that has really shown its class in the way it has risen to the challenge of the last few weeks.  A particular thank you to their indefatigable general manager Martin Hurley. We are very very grateful and look forward to our return in more normal times.",5,0.9935
Pros: Lancaster is an amazing hotel. The entire staff was amazing. I love the fact that they payed such close attention to their guests. The entire staff was friendly and  anticipated our every need.   Cons: The hallways were quite uncomfortable. Hot and often times smelly. The electricity in our room continually cut off. Which is very bothersome when trying to nap or bathe. ,5,0.856
"I would like to leave my positive review after staying at this new hotel for two nights. We have chosen a club room as we could use the lounge where drinks and some good tapas food are complimentary. The room and the bathroom are spacious with plenty of space.  Very comfortable bed and pillows. Breakfast has several good food choices. Staff are amazing and very helpful. Good outdoor swimming pool and gym. Location isn't very central but is only 5 minutes walk from the metro station where would take you 20 minutes to get to main city attractions. Within 10 minutes walk, you have as well the train station that connects you directly to the aitport in 30 minutes.  ",4,0.9637
"The staff at the hotel were beyond helpful. They answered all our questions, met all our needs, and got us to where we needed to be in Bangkok at all times. The room was awesomely clean, spacious, and very comfortable. The pool looked great(we didn't take advantage of it, unfortunately) and the bar area next to the pool afforded spectacular views of Bangkok. We would definitely stay there again!",5,0.8846
All friendly and professional despite own concerns. Nice rooms and very good breakfast. Had a nice evening in the restaurant with excellent food and good drinks to avoid being outside in the crowd. Thanks to Arm who transfered our luggage and checke for lost property.,5,0.921
"W arrived at this fabulous hotel and were immediately escorted to the Club lounge to complete our check in. This was swift and very professional.  Our room was on the 15th floor and was amazing.  This is a 1st class hotel whose staff are very professional and more than happy to help. The club lounge is a perfect place for tranquility and the service is impeccable . I must mention one of the staff in this area  Frongbeer, who was superb and an absolute credit to the hotel.  We were on a bed and breakfast basis and the choice was also superb. The Hotel was spotlessly clean and the entire staff friendly and helpful. It is located approx 200 metres from an underground station from which you can access all the areas of Bangkok. I would love to return to this 5 star hotel and would",5,0.993

This was a excellent hotel in a perfect location. The staff were excellent they were always very pleasant and helpful. Probably one of the best we experienced in our travels. Will definfiatley stay again when in Bangkok    ********,5,0.9718
"Walking into the grand lobby of this hotel set the experience for the rest of our four night stay--it's a stunning entrance.  We don't stay in many of five star accommodations but have visited enough to know there's a range of quality even at that level. The Lancaster delivers a luxurious and attentive experience. Many people have already written about the fabulous perks of this place. Some small details that stand out in my mind include the opulent marble bathroom in the lobby with mirrors that made me feel like I entered an Alice in Wonderland reality.  We loved how attentive the breakfast staff were and that they remembered our coffee preferences. The club level was stunning and we were welcomed every day by Tarn who could not have been more delightful (thanks Tarn, we miss",5,0.9825
I can not fault this establishment at all. The room was immaculate. The staff so very kind and helpful. The service at the SPA was simply perfection. Our stay was wonderful from beginning to end. Plenty of little details and small touches that made this hotel one of my all time favourites. Will most certainly come back.,5,0.9606

"We had a non-refundable booking with Lancaster Bangkok. However, due to the coronavirus situation, we were keen to reschedule or cancel our booking.  Contacted the hotel and then immediately allowed us to reschedule our booking to a later date given the circumstances (even though the booking was non-refundable with no changes permitted).  I appreciate the gesture and looking forward to staying at the Lancaster Hotel once the situation normalizes.",5,0.25
"In an ideal location for navigating your way round Bangkok; large well appointed rooms, coupled with tremendous staff that are not only convivial, but are professional - they were proactive and nothing was too much trouble. The small touches such as an abundant supply of free in-house bottled water; these small but well thought of gestures makes a stay at any hotel memorable to want to return time and again. Finally, the hotel is priced competitively against its other 5* counterparts. I recommend this hotel unreservedly.",5,0.9225
"Very nice hotel, great rooms, very clean, very helpful and extremely friendly staff. Close to airport link and to the metro, so it is in a good location to explore the city. We had a great stay and would like to come back! ",5,0.9806
"The location of the hotel is great.  It is close to the Airport Rail Link and the MRT (I.e. subway) station.  You can get to the hotel via the airport rail (depends on how many pieces of luggage do you have).  The hotel is considered new since it was opened in 2017, however, the sink in my room has cracks.  The first night we were there was just for stay over then to Chiang Mai.  As we would return, we asked to leave our winter jackets in the hotel and they were delighted to do it.  I also forgot to return the card key and didnâ€™t get penalized.  The first night experience was perfect.  After travelling in various places in Thailand and return to Bangkok staying in Lancaster.  The experience was somewhat different.  First of all, the slippers had been used.  When we asked to",4,0.8979

"This hotel received some of the highest and most glowing reviews from the booking site that I used.  Though a solid hotel and priced well, I wouldn't say it's spectacular.    I had three big issues:  #1. The internet wasn't consistent.  There will be periods where it will not work. Wait 5-10 minutes then it works again.   #2 There is a constant clicking sound from the A/C and what I think is the networking setup since everything in the room is controlled by a tablet.  When you turn on lights, or do whatever, you hear a constant clicking sound.  It's quite loud and it goes through the night. I found it annoying when trying to sleep at night.   #3: My shower's hot water wasn't constant. My hot water would randomly turn to cold water.  It happened 2 of my 3 night stay.  Wasn't a",4,0
"My mother and I recently stayed at The Lancaster Bangkok for two evenings with Club access.  The hotel is very conveniently located very close to a major underground station and the expressway leading to the airport. The hotel also runs a shuttle service to the underground station, so we did not have to worry about walking. It is about a 2-3 minute easy walk from the exit of the underground to the hotel.  The hotel facilities are absolutely fantastic. They have a fantastic gym with superb changing rooms. The swimming pool is located high up, with great views of Bangkok and the surrounding skyline. The hotel also has spa facilities; however, we did not have chance to indulge.  The room was amazing. My mother was upgraded to a suite with a kitchen/living room/bedroom/bathroom. The",5,0.976

Each and every staff member I encountered here was excelled in their customer service. The property condition was awesome and the room service was on point. Would definitely return. ,5,0.9559
"I picked this property based on TripAdvisor and it's proximity to transit. We were only staying 2 nights but wanted to be close to the MBT and skytrain as well as Klong Saen Sep and its canal boats. The property itself is beautiful,  staff friendly and professional. The breakfast buffet was excellent, one of the better I have had in a hotel in Thailand, well worth it. One caveat is I usually opt for Thai food when in Thailand and never am disappointed. Our room was clean, modern and spacious as I opted for the family room. Comfortable beds, nice bath and a very quiet location. We took the water taxi from 1 block away to Jim Thompson house and then to the end of the line, I believe it was 12 baht each. One word of caution, the boat doesn't stay tied up long, as soon as the",5,0.9901

"A very pleasant experience from the first minute.  Amazing first impression of the lobby. A large open space in atrium style from the floor to the skylight, with marbles, furniture in oriental taste and a nice overall palette of colours in ochre, dark green and pale gold.  The staff was very friendly, welcoming and helpful. As soon as I arrived they offered me a cold refreshment, which I really appreciated.  I booked a large en-suite double-bed room; very comfortable with a spacious bathroom covered in marble with a very nice tub. Apart from a couple of stains in carpet and curtains, the level of cleanness was very high.  I had my breakfast in the hotel (tourism the rest of the day) and the quality of the food was very good, with fresh fruit everyday. Last day I enjoyed a couple",5,0.9904

I forgot to get his name by his the same driver who drop me off at the airport also. When I arriving at the hotel they served me some fresh refreshment it was very good something to cool you off since hit was hot that day. I was greeted by (Bell) she was outstanding and very helpful. The best part is she help me fix my WiFi on my phone which she didn't had to. She gets a 6 stars for that. Love my room, they gym, and the pool. Also love the breakfast.

Very large and well equipped gym, basically the same as a club gym!   For the price I would return but if wanting your full 5 star luxury I would suggest your larger chains such as Grand Hyatt or JW Marriott, as the Lancaster was more in keeping with a good 4 star hotel.

"We stayed at The Lancaster in Bangkok at the end of Jan 2020 for 6 nights. Overall we had an amazing stay and would definitely visit again.   location: The hotel is situated about 3 mins from an underground station which took us to all the places we wanted to visit. All main tourist attractions are within 15-20 mins on the public transport system. The hotel does not have many restaurants around, there is a seven eleven across the road. The hotel is super easy to reach from the main airport by taxi or by public transport.   The amenities: We loved the hotelâ€™s amenities. There is an amazing pool on the top floor, looking out over Bangkok. You can order drinks and snacks from the bar at the pool.

We had a delicious welcome drink while waiting for the paper work to be done too.   The overall design of the hotel despite being a little old, it is still classy and clean. The room was spacious for our 4 huge luggages with ample space to move about. The bathroom is clean and spacious too with sufficient hot water for our shower and bathtub.

We booked a standard room which was the cheapest on their website and it was huge... probably 30 sq/m. The hotel is about a 5 minute walk from the train station. It's quicker and cheaper to get the train from the airport over a taxi so I'd recommend anyone visiting takes the train.  A taxi to Khao San Road was around 150 baht. A taxi to the airport (before the trains run) is 500 baht including tip.  The hot tub on the roof is small but lovely!

When we arrived at the first day, they served us very delicious cold juice meanwhile they were preparing our room.   Since the guy of front desk saw us enjoying the drink so much, he brought us another glass for each one.   Nice touch!   The day we had to check out, our flight was very late in the night.

"For this yearâ€™s trip, we finally decided on the Lancaster for our Bangkok layover, and we were so right to do so! We arrived yesterday, for a 2 night stay, and, by the grace of the reception staff, we were upgraded to a premiere suite on the 8th floor. Weâ€™ve stayed in many suites in previous hotels, and weâ€™ve been in Bangkok 3 times now, but by far this is the best looking hotel room/suite. The moment we stepped in the room, it was just WOW! The suite is huge, and it is so tastefully designed, with such high quality furnishings!! Marble walls and bathrooms, hard wood detailing, marble countertops for the kitchinette area. There is even a make-up corner, besides a huge bathroom, powder room, separate bedroom. It trully is an amazing looking hotel, the quality can be seen",5,0.9812

I was highly irritated and was incredibly vocal in my displeasure.  The Hotel acknowledged their mistake and apologised repeatedly which I appreciated.   The Hotel itself is amazing. I have had the priveledge of staying in some really nice hotels, and this ranks up there with the best of them. We stayed in a 2 bedroom family suite. The rooms are modern and comfortable. The room is also very spacious and really well designed. 2 large TV's meant that we could watch whatever we wanted and the kids could do the same.   There have been many complaints on TA about their location, I found just the opposite. They are incredibly",5,0.8997
This is one of my favorite hotels in Bangkok. I stayed here probably 10 times now in the last two years. Quality in service make it an outstanding value. The staff is always warm and welcoming and the food is great! Very often on my stays I never leave the hotel except for shopping. I am particularly fond of the room service breakfast along with a pool in the gym. Fantastic views from the rooms and gym and pool. I look forward to my next visit.,5,0.9765
"My family (wife and two girls) were staying this hotel from December 21 to December 23, 2019. Hotel is very clean and all staffs are nice and polite. We were welcomed by Jay. He was very helpful with a very delightful manner. Complimentary breakfast was awesome too. Nothing to complain. I will definitely come back. Iâ€™d like to say thank to JAY again. See you soon JAY!!!  ",5,0.9853
"We were greeted warmly by Mr J in spite of arriving 3:30 dawn on our check in and personally showed us our nice and large family room with 2 separate Water closets (which is helpful for a family travelers) at the 15th floor. Nice rain shower and large lavatory counter. We are amazed by the lobbyâ€™s very high ceiling or sky roof glass which is around 18 floor high. Room Towels are really large. Stunned by the abundant supply of bottled water in our room not to mention the daily supply of apples during our 4 night stay. Restaurant are really nice and run by hardworking men and women where a special request of hot milk is happily given to me. Gym, pool with jacuzzi , spa and bar are strategically and conveniently located on same area on the 12th floor. Donâ€™t miss their pool and",5,0.9573
"Best hotel we have stayed in Bangkok. Breakfast was good, the pool was great and the gym looked awesome (just did not have time to test it) . Our room was fantastic. And the Best part is that they have a Sauna in the hotel! To a Finn that is a big deal and the sauna was really good! And it is next To the pool so could go for a swim afterward and sit by the pool and look at the city. What More can you ask for ðŸ˜Š",5,0.981
"All the previous reviews are correct.  We selected to stay here for a recent family vacation based on having read the very positive reviews.  We arrived after a very long flight and were welcomed graciously.  Communication before our arrival was helpful and we were pleasantly notified of a room upgrade.    Overall, the hotel is classy, peaceful, and comfortable.  Our room was very spacious for a family of 4 and had all the modern amenities needed.  Drinking water is made available each day.  The pool is excellent, the spa is a bit small but it was enjoyed, and the bar is cozy.   Breakfast was included and had many options to keep everyone satisfied.  The staff was always extremely polite and helpful.  We enjoyed our 3 nights immensely.",5,0.985
"Hotel is conveniently situated just outside the busy city centre, nearby a MRT station. When we arrived we were friendly welcomed by the staff. The lobby itself was a beacon of tranquillity, especially compared to the hustle and bustle of Bangkok city. The hotel is pretty big, but doesn't feel like a massive place (compared to other big 5-star hotels). It is actually quite intimate. Check-in went smoothly. We booked three rooms and got them all adjoining.  Rooms self were spacious and very modernly equipped. You can tell it is a new hotel. Bathroom was perfect, with separated/enclosed (rain)shower and toilet. There was also a nice looking bath. The bed (kingsize) has got to be one of the best beds I have ever slept on in Thailand, with a perfectly soft mattress. Closet space in",5,0.9789
It is a pretty new hotel. The gym and the steam room is really nice. But they have to improve their service. We ask for a shower at check out day around 10p.m. but they provided only toothbrushes and can not give us a shower. I was thinking we can go to the gym for a shower as the advertising the gym is 24 hours open. But this is not the case. It close at 10p.m. ,2,0.6245
"This place is a gem! I felt so lucky to stay here for several nights and only wished I'd been able to stay longer! Pros: - The staff are incredibly friendly, helpful and welcoming (also, the proficiency in English was fabulous and so appreciated!) - The hotel is very clean and comfortable (great beds and pillows!) - The gym is one of the best I've seen in a hotel - The 12th floor pool and bar area are both gorgeous - The breakfast buffet was excellent - The location is a very short walk from both the BKK Airport Link train and and the Phetchaburi subway stop  - The personal care products are high quality Cons - A bit out of a main ""tourist"" area (this was a PLUS for me, but it did take about 25 mins by subway to reach the popular sites, so location might be a factor for tourists",5,0.975
"They brought us delicious tea and a refresher towel as soon as we arrive in the lobby. We arrived early and they happily held our bags, and answered all our questions about navigating the MRT.   The hotel is located less than a 5 minute walk away from a MRT/subway station. We were able to go to the main tourist attractions, markets and shopping malls in 20-30 minutes or less. In addition, we were only 20 minutes away (by taxi) from both of the airports in Bangkok.   The room was amazing, the gym was state of the art (it had new equipment, a yoga studio and TRX!), and the rooftop pool was beautiful. We will definitely be back at the Lancaster the next time we are in Bangkok. ",5,0.9678
"Should be a pretty new hotel near Makkasan station on Airport Link rail, just about 8 minutes walk. All the staff were polite with smiling face at all time. Room has reasonable size.The pool is on 12th floor with a far view of north bangkok though it is not a big one. Sauna room &amp; gym are well maintained. Breakfast has good quality food with fresh juices. Egg &amp; noodle station had nice chefs doing their jobs properly. Hotel vicinity does not have anything around. One has to take MRT to Sukumvit or walk 20 mintues there. Usually there's a shuttle to the station but in the morning of departure, it was not there for unknown reason. No group tour seen &amp; a good place to relax for a few days.",4,0.9194
"A hotel with everything you could ask for- excellent servics, facilities and ambiance! An overall great stay. The hotel makes great use of technology to make you feel more special and connected with the staff and services offered. Althea staff, especially Nat, made us feel very welcome and comfortable. Thank you for the experience!",5,0.9772
Great location...easy to go to anywhere sightseeing and the airport. Staff are friendly and helpful. Breakfast is fine as not many choices as other 5 start Hotels as Sheraton or W hotel. It will be more like business trip to stay in.  ,4,0.9286
"Lancaster hotel Bangkok was a nice election and very good experience to stay with our family, couple and a couple of adolescents. Very complete and comfortable. The only pitty was the a/c that doesnâ€™t have the Auto option so I got a cold and caugh because of that ",5,0.861
We really enjoyed our stay at the Lancaster. The hotel is beautifully designed and stands out even among all the other 5-star properties in Bangkok. A special bonus were the large rooftop pool area and adjacent full gym as well as the sauna and steam room; all included for free with the stay.   The breakfast is also very enjoyable and despite being very busy at peak times did not feel overcrowded. Staff has been very friendly and helpful. We put this hotel high up on our list of places to come back to during one of the next Bangkok trips.  ,5,0.9811
"The staff were very friendly and helpful. They even prepared a little surprise for my girlfriendâ€™s birthday.  The room was large and well appointed. The location is good to go from BKK airport by the sky train. The hotel locates a few stations away from those busy tourist spots, but it is easy and cheap to get a taxi or grab in Bangkok anyway.",5,0.8881

"I'e stayed at the Lancaster on numerous occasions because I prefer an outstanding property with reasonable prices. The service is impeccable and all staff members have a very professional attitude. The rooms are large, extremely clean and  comfortable. I usually prefer to try different hotels, but in Bangkok I find myself repeatedly returning to the Lancaster.",5,0.6983
"Spent 5 nights in Bangkok at the Lancaster Bangkok over the NYE holiday. This is a great hotel and really enjoyed the stay at the property.  While this property is an older hotel the property has been very well maintained and the room product is very modern and up to date in style and technology.   The Spa was fantastic, luck me I stayed during holiday promotion so got some great deals on treatments while there.  The Gym is huge, biggest gym I have been in at a hotel.   The staff was great, especially the crew at the rooftop bar and the Doorman team.  Very helpful with taxi's and information about how to get around town.   Property is just off the main area, so a 15 min walk get to the heart of action in BKK, but enjoyable to not be right in the middle of the chaos.",5,0.9445
"We strongly suggest this beautiful Hotel to everyone! We stayed three nights in the Executive Apartment which is very spacious and it has all the amenities you may need. I strongly suggest everyone to book a room which has access to the Lancaster Club situated on the 18th floor. Considering the strong heat in Bangkok during the day, you can enjoy a full day just by being in the hotel with delicious breakfast, some lunch on the ground floor, a nice swim at the beautiful pool, some afternoon tea and cocktail time at the Club Lounge :)  However, most importantly, what made our stay so so special was not the spacious room or the beautiful pool... not even the perfect breakfast in the morning... it was the sweet and extended care of the hotelier Tarn in the Club that made everything",5,0.9911
"Although it was not our first time to Bangkok, it was our first stay to Lancaster and we were very positively surprised! I would compare it to Hyatt standard.   During the same holiday we also stayed for a night in another five star hotel in the area and it felt like an outdated 3 star at best. So if you have a chance and grt a room, stay at Lancaster, it is worth every euro!  The facilities are modern and stylish, staff very well trained, friendly and kind, rooms and bathrooms very comfortable (excellent king size bed!) and beautiful - nothing to complain about really. On top of that they offer free shuttle swrvice to neaeby MRT/train link station.  Rooftop bar with a pool is a cherry on the cake!  Just to show what great hospitality standard they represent, on my husband's",5,0.993
"This is my first time staying at Lancaster Bangkok for birthday trip. It was indeed one of my best birthday memories staying here! During check-in, I was greeted by Pop, holding a birthday cake and card as welcoming. That's really a nice start for my birthday.  The room is spacious, bright and clean. The bath tub is also nice for a night soak. This hotel is equipped with a spacious gym room and root-top swimming pool, and even a jacuzzi. The sauna and steam room are also a plus - not many hotels offer this.  The food choice of breakfast is acceptable, and the food is really delicious.  The staff here are very nice and friendly. They are always smiling at you, and active in identifying your needs. Thanks for your great hospitality that makes my birthday trip so memorable. Highly",5,0.9927
"This is a very good hotel, modern, clean and very comfortable. We stayed in a suite with complimentary club lounge access (special offer), and were well looked after by the gracious Tarn, eager &amp; professional Lars and fed by the talented Pui (sampled every tasty item on the menu at least 3 times!). I recommend even paying the additional fee to have this luxury. Every one of my party had nothing but praise for this team who cosseted us.  The suite (17th floor) itself is furnished to a high standard, bedroom, bathroom and separate lounge  befitting for this class of hotel. The hotel is very stylish, and decorated well. The staff (from front of desk, catering, room service) cannot be faulted, everything came with the legendary Thai smile and greeting. We were made to feel very",5,0.9674

"What to say? This hotel is fabulous!!! Great staff , great rooms with a tasty breakfast!! I think I died and landed in hotel heaven!! I loved everything about this hotel. The room was spacious and in great shape and came with free wifi. Our view was very nice and the toiletries were top notch!! The Italian chef at breakfast made sure that everyone was 100% happy and was nice enough to give my friend some fresh cream for her waffle.  The hotels front office staff was very helpful with guiding me around Bangkok's transportation maze. I loved the night market suggestion and found the staff very agreeable ,kind and helpful!!

The rooms are pristine and very tasteful and the service was very good throughout our stay. We indulged in room service on a couple of occasions and the food was excellent! The location is not ideal but it is a short (provided traffic cooperates) drive to where the action is and a slightly longer one to the Chaopraya. It is excellent value for the price.,4,0.9001

"Lancaster Bangkok, a member of the preferred hotel stays network worldwide. I personally never heard of the hotel up to the point my brother told me about the place. Having my family over for the holidays and New Year we spend the last days of our journey at this wonderful hotel. Itâ€™s located just next to the subway station and a 10 minute ride away from places like Asoke or Thonglor. Having that said thereâ€™s really no negative points. For starters the check in was flawlessly done by Khun New (GSS), rooms were ready, deposit was handled very professional without any delays or miscommunication.

Ms Belle was kind enough to arrange a card and photo and a cake when I wanted to surprise my husband on our 33rd anniversary. Everything was smooth from check in and till the end of my stay. Room is comfortable and very clean. Got a free upgrade as I am a gold exclusives member with hotels.com and they took note of that without even asking. Slept well on the king size bed with nice pillows and mattress. Breakfast was good and so was the coffee. Will not hesitate to stay again when I bring my whole family to Bangkok in future.
