"Staycationed here with my partner. I visited the executive lounge - it had a great ambience and got to know Chef Nino who was friendly and made delicious food. Nice view of the pool. We dropped by Cool Cats too, a nice jazz joint at the back of the hotel. We also went to the spa to check it out and explored the facilities - there was a steam room, sauna, and my fave - jacuzzi with perfect temperature. I loved the space, it was a calm and serene place. A staff member named Sherry showed us around and let us try the zero gravity chair which was very cool. She was very friendly and professional and shared with us the treatments on offer which we will definitely try next time! The bed was comfortable and we had a great night's sleep. Really good service all round, worth visiting",5
"The JW Marriott South Beach delivers everything you would expect from the JW Marriott brand. The hotel and grounds are immaculately maintained, the staff are friendly and attentive, the facilities are quite good and the views are wonderful.   The hotel is conveniently located atop the Esplanade MRT stop. There are multiple restaurants and bars in the same block both in the main building and a heritage building on the property. You can cross the street to Suntec mall for shopping and dining or walk a block to Raffles City or restauarants near Bugis.  You can easy access the Esplanade theatre and offices in the CBD with a 15 minute walk or 10 minute ride.   Rooms at the hotel are comfortably sized and offer various unobstructed views of the city. They have Nespresso machines for",5
"My family and I stayed at this lovely hotel mid March and I would highly recommend it. The JW doesn't disappoint in it's cleanliness, service, food and staff. This hotel is very centrally located and a short 2 minute walk to the MRT. The Beach Road Kitchen offered a phenomenal breakfast with many choices. We were welcomed every morning with a bright smile from Lim Pei and they remembered our drink orders.. Chef Charles and his staff (including Gaba) treated us like royalty and was prepared to make each meal delightful. Breakfast became a smorgasbord of flavors and dishes. The Club Lounge had excellent snacks (drinks) and Lionel did his best to accommodate our needs. The gym is on the 18th floor with great views and always stocked with water and cold towels. The front desk staff",5
"I had my first hotel spa in my life and it was excellent. Firstly, I got to use their spa facility which were refreshing. Shaa who welcomed me at the reception was warm and friendly. She explained to me what the uses of the steam room and sauna were since I am not used to all of this and she was detailed and knowledgeable. They helped to lessen the muscle tightness that I had and I felt so much lighter. Later on I had a 1.5 hour massage done by Mandy, which I immediately fell asleep during the massage. I guess the aroma oil that she chose for me played a part and I could tell that she was skilled and experienced. Mandy was nice to let me  rest for awhile as I was too relaxed sleepy. Eventhough I did a free massage, they stilI treated me very well and professionally which I",5
"I booked a couple's spa with 60 min massage for my fiance's birthday. We were greeted by a cheerful and friendly Azizah, who patiently explained all the different aromas for us to use for the massage. We were also served a delightfully sweet and well balanced ginger tea. My therapist was Mandy, whom I highly recommend. Her technique was firm and strong yet relaxing, slowly kneading out all the pressure knots in the neck and shoulders. She was also very accommodating to my requests to repeat some motions for target areas. The room was very cosy and had a secluded feel, with en suite shower and bathroom. After the full body massage we were treated to the relaxation lounge that was quiet and serene for another cup of ginger tea (and a selection of other teas, if you so desire).",5
"JW Marriott took every precaution in the book to make sure we were safe, and well taken care of. They were extremely sweet to handwrite cards wishing me a happy birthday, and the Spa by JW was absolutely relaxing and refreshing. Therapists Hatmah and Mandy need to be specially commended, since they customised treatments for my fiancee and me. Azizah and Shah at the reception were also extremely knowledgeable and professional, best I've seen in any spa.   Glad that we were able to unwind safely despite the situation. Thanks to JW Marriott for keeping us safe and comfortable.",5
"Was pleasantly surprised by the warm and personalised hospitality provided by the hotel. Would like to thank Kendy, Lisa and Sherrine for the lovely touch for the room decoration from the drawing to the balloons and cake!   It made the occasion even more special it memorable. The effort provided by the staff with the easy check-in and express check out made the stay pleasant.   The room was spacious and clean. The amenities provided were of high-quality and sufficient throughout the stay.",5
"Came here for a night to celebrate my friend’s birthday, was pleasantly surprised with our photos (supplied by us to the hotel via email) taped to balloons, as well as a prettily decorated bathroom mirror door, and special treats!! It was extremely welcoming, huge thank you to Sherrie, Lisa and Kendy for the wonderful decorations and the handwritten card. Views were fantastic, staff were extremely hospitable and acceded to our requests for items, and we really enjoyed the place and people. Not the mention a pleasant and easy check-out at the end of our whole stay by Eden! Thank you JW Marriott! ",5
"Overall great service, but silly rules for the executive lounge - they didn’t allow guests wearing tank tops to enter, but allowed guests wearing shorts, crop tops and sandals. Doesn’t seem to make sense and can’t understand the rationale. Nevertheless special shout out to Lionel the trainee sous Chef who was very friendly and provided great service!",4
"I stayed 1 night at JW Marriott South Beach from 29 March to 30 March. Last stay was on 1 July 2017. Both are for short getaway staycations to celebrate special occasions.   What I like:  -Club lounge at level 2. Spacious layout and comfortable setting. Good spread of food and wide choice of beverages. -The ever presence of Eva Abdullah (since first stay) and the lovely team under her charge. The lads at the club lounge were very cheerful, helpful and proactive. They have a strong sense of purpose and are constantly looking out for emptied plates or mingling with the guests. Remembers you by the last name as well.  -Instagram worthy level 18 recreation area (houses the gym, pool and snack bar) which offers a 360 degree view of the city. From the CBD, to the marina promenade and",5
"Me and my girlfriend decided to have a staycation at JW Marriott for one night and we had access to the exec lounge. We were there from 2:30 onwards and did not leave the place until it closed. We were given a wonderful service by Melvin, Fussaf, and Chef Lionel, another the filipino head chef and all the other staff that were working there. They were all warm and welcoming. Thank you all for the wonderful experience.",5
"Chef Niño not only makes delicious food, but amazing conversation. what a treat this was. thank you for a lovely evening!!!! I throughly enjoyed the risotto and especially the dessert. and dinner with a view!",5
"Finishing our one week staycation at this hotel, in fact it's our second stay here in two weeks.   Totally love this place, it just like a safe sanctuary to us during this period of time. Tight safety measures are taken for the Covid-19. Temperature taking at the main entrance and hand sanitizers are seen at almost every corner in the premises.  As Ambassador Elite Guests, we have spent most our time at the Executive Lounge. Good atmosphere and environment for both business and leisure, with good people and good food.  We have met many hospitable hotel staffs throughout our stay here. However there is a particular one that we are most impressed with and we think we should mention his name here to encourage him to keep up his good work and keep on shining. Although he is just a",5
"We really enjoyed our one night stay at J W Marriott. It is a sprawling resort with a wide range of top class facilities.  Special mention to Lionel, the intern chef at the level 2 lounge. Dinner was delicious, and the spread of food was great!",5
"This is my 2nd time staying with JW Marriott South Beach within 3 months. I was here last weekend for my birthday celebration. While both stays' experience was good, I must say this 2nd stay was much better, perhaps, as it is the off-peak season for hotel industry here.   Perhaps due to the lesser number of guests, staffs are much more polite and obliging, although on both occasions, they were always professional in their interactions.  We had better interactions with staff this time as they showed personal care and concern, asking us how are we doing and chatting about the Covid19 situation. Because of the time and space to have such personal interactions, we felt more at home this staycation.   The chef on internship at Executive Lounge, Lionel, is a fine young chap, who was",5
"My wife and I decided to celebrate our 7th wedding anniversary with a weekend staycay and were really impressed!   The hotel is stylish and gorgeously decorated, in both the lobby / public areas and in the rooms. Location is great - connected via walkway to MRT and several malls in central Singapore. We had lunch in Akira Back and dinner at Madame Fan: Both excellent restaurants. Buffet breakfast in Beach Road Kitchen was somewhat underwhelming in comparison.  A special shoutout to Troy and the reservations team for the effort in preparing the best personalized room decoration that I've ever had in any hotel I've been to, which really set a great first impression for the whole stay.  Overall a very enjoyable stay and we'll be back soon!",5
" We had the most magical time at JW marriott Singapore. It was so hard to say goodbye. The staff made it so memorable for us. As soon as we entered the lobby Wayne greeted us, Sara the bell caption was always answering my questions, Patricia from the front desk gave me great recommendations and Luna the manager was also very accommodating.  The restaurant staff was also my fav. They talked to us everyday like family. Checking to see if we were comfortable or if we needed anything. Ali made sure our breakfast was always perfect. He even helped me pack a to-go bag our last day. Raymond was such a friendly morning greeter as well. He always has a huge smile on his face. Melvin was a great host when we had hors . Chef Arjun always brought my son his favorite fruit jambu. Even if",5
"We had a great massage at Spa by JW with our masseuse Carmen and Hatmah. Big spa and looks so luxurious. They have a steam room, sauna and jacuzzi as well which you can use complimentary if you have treatments with them. However their jacuzzi was not working at that point of time when we came. The receptionist Shaa apologised and allowed us to come back at any time to enjoy the spa facilities so no issues with that! Great service overall!",5
"I visited the Spa at JW Marriott for the third/fourth on 18th March and was treated to the best massage yet by Therapist Hatmah. Her pressure was perfect right from the start and it was relaxing throughout the session!  I also want to commend on your spa receptionist Shakinah (i hope i spelled her name right if not i'm sorry!) for her impeccable hospitality, professionalism and product knowledge. She is always so welcoming and warm! She takes time to ask me about work and gets to know me better, something i find that is lacking in the service industry these days. Shakinah's essential oil recommendations have always hit the spot so far. Kudos to the rest of the team too! ",5
"We had recently gone back to Singapore for several days and stayed at the JW Marriott South Beach for the first time. Absolutely beautiful hotel, great accommodation and central location. All staff interactions were always very attentive and  friendly. We wanted for nothing and nothing was too much trouble. Excellent customer service was provided throughout the Hotel; from the Front Desk staff,  Concierge, Housekeeping and Restaurant staff. Our favourite place to relax after a day out and about in Singapore was the Tonic Bar where we met the very professional and  friendly Khosi. Her very broad knowledge on all things Gin is very interesting and amazing. We would highly recommend this hotel. Thank you JWM we will be back.",5
My friends and I stayed at the executive suite and really enjoyed our time at the executive lounge. The room was spacious and comfortable and the service is impeccable! Can't wait for my next stay here!,5
"I had a very nice stay.  I was upgraded to a very spacious corner suite with great views.  Bed was comfortable. Spacious bathroom, great views from tub and toilet.  The executive lounge staff was very professional. Lots of drink and hot food options. The infinity pool was great, although very cold.  Gym had new machines and multiple equipment. Breakfast was delicious, multiple stations with all kinds of food. It was very busy.  Location is great, close to MRT and Suntec, parks, marina, Raffles hotel, everywhere. Overall had an Excellent stay. The facilities were great, and staff was also very well trained, professional.",5
"Had a delightful, relaxing time tonight at the Executive lounge. Special thanks to Lionel - we loved the food and enjoyed the special Singaporean treats you made. The  Old Fashion was also top notch. Best of luck in your chef career!",5
"I simply love the executive lounge. A good place to chill and relax. I would like to express my thanks to Bella, Rose, Nur, Jacquelyn, Melvin and the Chef, Lionel for a wonderful service.The staff in The Beach Road Kitchen, helmed by Hyacinth, we’re also wonder. I love the spread served during breakfast.",5
Had great service at the Executive Lounge during our weekend staycation. Great selection of drinks and food. Service staff (including chef Lionel) was very friendly and attentive to our needs. Coffee at the lounge could be better though.,5
"My suite wasn't ready when i checked in, but the front desk executive Wai Ying was most apologetic and invited me to the lounge for afternoon tea, and later delivered the key cards to me at the lounge. She also took the initiative to compensate me with a late checkout.   The suite was very spacious and had a beautiful, sleek and modern design, with a breathtaking view of the marina bay. The bed was supremely comfortable. The only bugbears were a  lingering, slightly pungent smell (perhaps due to strong disinfectants used against COVID-19) and the weak air-conditioning in the bedroom (set it to 19 degrees, max fan speed, and it was still warmer than the living room which was set at 22 degrees).  It was a happy coincidence to see Wai Ying at the front desk again the next day when",5
"I visited the executive lounge and was served by Lionel. He was attentive and made sure that we were comfortable. He was thoughtful throughout and made sure we were well taken care of. Towards the closing of the lounge, he even made sure we had enough drinks to go. Thank you for the memorable service, Lionel!",5
"Beautiful hotel with excellence - repeated by me. Stayed here 6-8 March. Nice comfy room, suite room facing Suntec - comfy bed and amenities. Great service as usual from the lounge from Lionel, Melvin, rose and team. Breakfast? Go for the nasi lemak - very authentic !",5
"I was at the executive lounge with a business acquaintance for catching up. Good selection of quality foods.   Lionel served us and was especially good, and attentive .  It felt like we were VIP in a fine dining restaurant.",5
"Pool view from the 18th floor. Spectacular !! Such a great stay so relaxing “great spa”. Food was fabulous, with a delish brunch. Could not have picked a better hotel or city for our much needed vacation.",5
"Loved it!  Beautiful, modern and hip design.  Very clean and well maintained hotel.  All employees were exceptionally friendly and very attentive.  Our room was very comfortable and well designed.    Located across the street from the Raffels Hotel and a 15 minute walk to MBS.  Located directly above the Esplanade MRT station.  Convenient to everything.  2 pools.  One located on the 18th floor of the west tower.  This pool is unheated and gets no sun whatsoever.  No lounge chairs.  This pool is about looks, not function.  The second pool is located on the 6th floor of the east tower.  This pool is also unheated, but gets more sun.  It’s partially covered by an overhang.  A few lounge chairs and more traditional seating.  The spa has a steam room, sauna, and jacuzzi— free for",5
"We stayed at this hotel to celebrate our 12th wedding anniversary and were very satisfied with all the services &amp; surprising wall graffiti in our room.   There are lots of shopping malls, cafes &amp; restaurants around it so you can easily lose track of the time. And besides, they provide various menus at the breakfast buffet restaurant. I love their pretzel bread with French butter on it. ",5
"We got upgraded to a suite during check-in, celebrating a hens' night and staff helped to decorate the room.  The suite was huge and very spacious.   We requested for more bathroom slippers as there were 4 of us, but service staff came back and passed us a whole bag of toiletries enough for more than 4 pax, and we ended up bringing them home.   Thank you so much!",5
"I’m not one to easily fall asleep during a massage, particularly a leg massage, but the heated massage bed and comfortable bedding made it very easy to zen out. My therapist Hatmah is incredibly skilled and my feet feel rejuvenated even after just a mere 45 minutes.  So, if you want comfort and luxury with a solid massage thrown in, you can’t go wrong with visiting Spa by JW.",5
"I had the most pampering experience by my masseuse, Mandy. I had the 50-min Aching Legs massage and I managed to fall asleep despite the pain due to water retention in my calves. The room was spacious and did not make me feel claustrophobic and the heating mattress made the experience so much more comfortable. I will definitely come back again and make use of the facilities!",5
"We used our Marriot Vacation Club points to book for a 1 night stay at this hotel. For this stay we used 700 club points to secure a Quality Room. We likewise requested an early check in which was easily approved.  We had been away from Singapore for ten years and I had no recollection of a JW Marriot hotel in Singapore. I was informed that the hotel opened under the new Marriot management in early 2016 which was just 3 years ago.  The hotel is quite a landmark in the South Beach area because it is just beside Suntec City and Raffles hotel and is surrounded by all the shopping and restaurant  facilities in Marina Bay. In fact the 20th floor room which was given to us directly  overlooks the rooftop of Suntec City with a view of the Marina Bay Sands hotel, the Esplanade and the",4
"I booked a night at this fairly new hotel in Singapore.  Fairly pricey as well.  The entrance was impressive.  Service was detailed and friendly.  No issues there.   The room was however small and looked so minimalist white that if felt like an hospital room.   The  Japanese toilet that tries to clean you all the time was more annoying than satisfying.   The semi-roof top pool was not sexy at all.  Old PRC auntie swimming in. Water all over.  Dark. No music.  No beat.  Total was of time.  I decided to try the bars and restaurants.  Virtually none of the F&amp;B places are in the hotel (one tiny very unimpressive un -JW Marriott bar (Tonic) on the GF level near the lifts).  I was directed to ""take the lift, go up one floor, take the bridge, go left, go down, go out, go right and you",2
"The place is outstanding! Great accommodations to my family needs. The room and the pool was all very clean. A very special thanks to Martin for meeting my family needs. The view from the room was very breath taking! Rooms are high tech, service was very quick and easy. In overall the hotel is very high end.",5
"Spent 2 nights over at JW Marriot for my 21st birthday. Ambience is amazing, room was cosy and quality service from the crew (Shoutout to Sara and Wayne) who made my stay a pleasant and unforgettable one. Definitely will recommend to my friends!",5
I think that it is the latest Marriott property in Singapore. And it fits up to the standard as I wish from a JW brand hotel. As the Marriott Tang Plaza is a bit outdated I would recommend this one as my new Marriott default hotel in Singapore. A bit stylish in design and has everything you need.   Location is in the Suntec area so close by to everything.   A bit of downside is the pool that seems to be a bit small. But I didn't have time for swimming anyway. But if you are for looking for relaxing in the pool I would recommend that you look for other hotels.,5
"First the positives...it is in a great location, the staff was wonderful, and it has a lounge and breakfast restaraunt that might be the best I’ve seen.    That said, I felt the hotel feel short in several key ways, vs. other alternatives I know of and have stayed in when visiting Singapore.  The hotel is ‘styled to the max,’ but in the process, the public areas are not really terribly comfortable.  The gym is substandard for a hotel of this price/class, and the rooftop pool area is very chopped up, the pool small.  My biggest concern here is the room itself.  Many issues with the design and appointment.  It seems sterile, the bathroom complex had so many design issues it was hard to list them (lack of storage, lack of outlet, difficult to navigate, etc.).  No coffee maker,",3
"We had such a pleasant stay. The hotel superb location is situated right in the city center, with many nice malls, restaurants, and bars. As well as the walkable distance to many sights of Singapore(for tourists). The very modern chic rooms are the best! Very spacious, clean, comfortable and of course it's gorgeous view, especially at the pool too! XD We were served food in our room by Ramesh, I must mention, a very helpful and polite man, we were impressed by how he took the time to explain everything, made sure we got all that we need and most importantly to have the best experience here @ JW, a well-personalized service. =) Well done! Can't wait for another staycation here!",5
"I was sold to the rooms of the swisshotel but trying the JW has been the best thing I could have done. The personnel is beating all previous service experiences I had. The exec lounge is great but on the low floor level (2). This is a little drawback from the 70th floor view of the Swiss. However, the JW Marriott exec lounge has a better suited in my opinion, bar area with giant screen conducive to great conversation. The swimming pool is just awesome at the 18th floor wit a breath taking view of Marina Bay and downtown SG. A little drawback is in the bathrooms. I tried 3 different room models and none had an electrical outlet in the bathroom. There is no 110V in the room altogether but te concierge quickly solved this issue by providing me with a converter. Mirrors are not an",5
After a very desappointing stay at St Regis Singapore i went luckuly to this quite new hotel near Marina in Singapore congrats !  the design of Ph Starck is quite fun and impressive and the suites are nice sleek and great to enjoy few days 2 pools and fun amazing FISH bar  dont forget to visit the lounge and meet the very efficient Hazel there....smiling and professional girl and WOW for the breakfast at the restaurant in the morning the choice is incredible !! merci for this second stay and see you soon,4
"The JW on Beach Road was a fantastic stay, especially for a long business stay.   The service in the Lounge was fantastic, Chef John, Olive and the bar staff became almost friends in the couple weeks that I stayed at the JW.   They made a long business trip not only bearable, but fun.   They were always happy to talk, help with anything and suggest things to do over the weekend.  Such as a great hike in MacRitchie Resevoir park. Staff at the JW Marriott make it a reason to return again.",5
"Very impressive experience right from getting down from the car with the welcoming reception by its lobby ambassador; Lisa.  Although my sleep were disturbed by loud shouting noise from the adjacent room in the middle of the night, the hotel staff were very apologetic on it upon my check out although it was not their fault. Vivien Lee at front desk even offered to waive my breakfast which was a nice gesture.  All in all, great staff.",5
"We stayed at the JW Marriott Hotel for 5 nights and couldn't have been more thrilled with our stay.  Everyone was incredibly helpful and friendly.  The concierge also earned points for their spot on advice (using the metro system, getting reservations at restaurants, etc).  The bed was one of the most comfortable I've slept on.  Very sorry to have to leave its ambience and hope to return.",5
"I like the brand - this is why I’m Lifetime Platinum and then they gave me an Ambassador status. I like the hotel - this is why I came back for the fourth or fifth time within 12 months. I like #Singapore - this is why I extended my 6 nights stay for another couple of days. What I don’t like, though, is to be treated as a fool. You guys had me for 630 ++ in a suite and when I extended, you had the audacity to ask for almost 250 more. Seriously? Have you been at capacity? Was there a huge conference? Was it that Singapore was sold out? NO!!! The whole hospitality industry is bleeding and for another 2-3 months there will be no stopping because of the hype around this freaking virus. And how do you react to loyalty and the rare guests who extend? You screw them! Yes, there is no",3
"We had such good service here. The room was clean and pretty, the people at the hotel were so attentive. Hazel in the executive lounge was especially fabulous. I felt like she was always aware of us and anything we might want or need, and she was very engaging and friendly. She definitely made our experience even more special.",5
"when possible i always try and stay in a marriott hotel i have found that usually they are in the best locations and always have a steady standard service. the JW was no different the staff were friendly room was great, location was EXCELLENT i found no faults to be honest.. i will certainly stay again",5
"Stayed one night to celebrate wedding anniversary. The staff Ms Jusanna, was very helpful during our check-in when we asked for a west facing room with good view. Although the hotel has allocated us a room, she made effort to search for a better room without showing any signs of frustration. She served with her heart, very genuine. Her supervisor ( Don't know her name) was guiding patiently and also helped to search.  Everything about the hotel is up to our expectations, we enjoyed our stay!",5
"We stayed at this hotel for two nights over the New Year’s Eve celebration. First I must note that we loved how modern the hotel is. The disco lights in the lifts, the decor and most importantly the toilets in the room! Once you experience those toilets - there’s no going back. You would know what I mean once you stay there :)   We stayed in a lounge access room and it felt very spacious with modern finishes. Although the carpet on the floor looked a bit worn with strings hanging out of it. Not a great look! We had a semi ok view facing the suntec city shopping centre and a bit of the Marina. I was a bit disappointed by that as I thought paying $800 a night would have had better views. But whatever... Wasn’t going to let it spoil our stay.  Staff are very friendly. I can’t name",4
"My family and I stayed here on vacation for 8 nights. We extended our stay because the hotel is so amazing. I am Titanium Lifetime so I am familiar with Marriott's properties and this JW is the one of my top stays. The building is new. Rooms are spacious and have large windows. the executive lounge is over the top great and location at South Beach next to Raffles Hotel is fantastic. Lots of great restaurants and bars to choose. But the real stars at the JW are the staff....Up in the exec lounge Eva, Esther, Srankvi, Yosuf  and Andrea were incredibly helpful and friendly!! Matin at the front desk gave us a great art tour of south beach and Nicola at Cool Cats jazz bar was also great. If you like Marriott at it's best this is for you when in Singapore.",5
Most travellers to singapore prefer the marina bay sands for the hype but if you want true hospitality jw marriott south beach can offer in abundance! From early check in to a greaf breakfast to even helping out on getting back something i lost in a taxi. Thats the extent of effort they put! Breakfast is very global covering cuisines from around the world and the place is beaming with happy vibes! The place to stay if you plan on travelling to singapore. It is value for money!,5
"There really is nothing bad to say about this hotel. First the service really is excellent, which is something that hotels often make empty promises about, but the JW Marriott really delivers. Very professional without being obsequious. The rooms are clean and fresh looking, with bidet toilets. I really like the couches along the windows as well. The suites have in-room Nespresso while the regular ones only have instant coffee, which is a bit disappointing. I would definitely opt for a club room, as the lounge has an elaborate food spread for breakfast, and wine, cocktails, and pretty good food in the evenings. The food is from the same kitchen as Beach Road Kitchen restaurant below it. The infinity pool and bar on the 18th floor overlooking the bay is also an excellent place to",5
"My husband, son and I recently stayed here for 4 nights. We stayed in an oversized room with a sitting area. They call this a “family room”.  The sofa converted to a sofa bed which was more comfortable than the usual sofa bed because they bring an actual mattress in to make the bed. My son slept very well. The room and the rest of hotel is decorated in a modern luxurious style. The hotel is in a great location to walk to many places. And the service was consistently professional, warm and welcoming. We were greeted by name at the executive lounge. Everyone was lovely and Hazel took good care of us.",5
"Stayed one night so my stay was short. Check in was good. Met at the taxi and escorted to the lounge for check in. Soon after was in my room. Not very large for sure but adequate. Pool on the 18th floor was nice, good view of downtown. The gym is also up here fairly large for a good workout. The spa was very nice. I went down to hit the steam and sauna. If you have time good place to relax.   The hotel sits atop an area of shops, restaurants and pubs. It's extremely convenient to get out of the hotel for a bite to eat or cocktail. The MRT Esplanade is also underneath the hotel so easy to get around. The Executive lounge is across a walkway. Not the best not the worst. I have seen better. The food was average I thought. Overall the hotel has the vibe of a W and not a JW. Not that",5
"This review is long overdue.  I joined my husband on his business trip to Singapore- my first time visiting, his second.  The hotel was clean, with a very modern feel.  The staff were amazing.  From Hai Yang in housekeeping to Hazel and Melvin in the Executive Lounge- every staff member we interacted with was friendly and helpful.  Hai Yang went above and beyond when cleaning our room, Hazel had great suggestions for places to visit, and Melvin made wonderful drinks.  I loved the location- being across from SunTec made it very easy to catch the MRT, a bus, or call a Grab to go out and see the city.  It was also great to have such a wide variety of shopping options so close so we could pick up anything we forgot (and some kaya from Ya-Kun for friends and family back home).",5
"Having stayed at many J.W.s, this one is fine. More modern and a bit sterile but very clean.  What made our stay special were the staff in the lounge, especially Eva and Hazel.  Both greeted us by name, made sure we were comfortable, and had much good advice about sightseeing in the city.",4
"Designed by Philippe Starck, the hotel has a very modern feel. Room was ok (I feel it’s smaller compared to other JWM) and some of the furnishing looked worn already.  If you get a room on the high floor, the view is splendid. Infinity pool on the 18th floor is a bit small and if you have few families, the pool seem very crowded. However the view is good. Breakfast spread is good and the lounge’s food selection is excellent. ",5
Room is clean. Breakfast is good. Comfortable bed and room. We had a good time staying in this hotel.keep it up. Would like to try the suite in future. Recommended hotel. Price could be higher but as long as the quality is good.,4
"This hotel is one of the newest in this location, so it was immaculate and modern. Only downside were the pillows. They were too soft or too hard. Strange why they got those type of pillows for such a luxury hotel.   I got the room with the Marina Bay View which I highly recommend. Just top up slightly in the rates to get a fantastic day and night view of the city. We were very fortunate that there was fireworks during that night and for a full view of the spectacle from the comfort of our room!   There is a pool on the 18th level. This was quite underwhelming as it was short in length and only 1.2m deep. But it does provide a breathtaking open view of the city. Good for Instagrammable photos of cos.   The location of the hotel is very good. It’s well linked to other shopping",4
"We stayed for 3 days prior to a cruise. The service was great and the views from the pool area on the 18th floor were awesome. Hazel, in the executive lounge was absolutely fantastic. She made our breakfast visits exceptional. She always had a smile on her face and set up a place for the six of us every morning.",5
"Just checked out of this amazing hotel after a five night stay. Wow! It exceeded all expectations. From the moment you arrive and walk through the very generously proportioned foyer that has a super relaxed feel, to the staff who are highly professional and friendly - and lots of them around to assist all of the time. We had a suite with sep lounge on the 17th floor, incredible views overlooking the Singapore Cricket Club and the Raffles Hotel. Marina Bay Sands also visible. Also had a twin room for our daughters aged 17 &amp; 20 which was on level 6. Love the contemporary decor and space- high ceilings, huge bathroom and separate foyer and powder room. We were able to entertain extended family as the huge size of the living room had two good sized sofas and two armchairs plus a",5
"I loved this hotel and Marriott in general. I have been a fan since staying at the Marriott near my home in Santa Clara CA, and even have great memories of the adjacent theme park they once owned.   This hotel has an infinity pool with an epic view...The only thing I would mention is that despite a city of skyscrapers, the view from the pool seemed low (probably because of the surrounding sky scrapers. )  Also, the Raffles is 30 seconds away, if you want to try the bar where the Singapore sling was invented. ;)",4
We stayed here for 5 nights as part of a longer trip between Asia and India.   The JW Marriott felt like home the moment we walked in the door (even at 0200.)   The service was never lacking and the staff was always offering to help.   We spent the majority of our hotel time in the executive lounge and were blown away by the attentiveness of the staff as well as the quality of the food offerings.  Breakfast was amazing and the evening hors d’ouvres were phenomenal.  The whole staff was amazing but Hazel and Yussef stood out as shining stars.   If we are ever back in Singapore we will be staying at the JW Marriott without hesitation,5
"Just returned from a 2 night stay at JW Marriott South Beach and was completely wowed by the entire experience. We checked-in at 11.15pm at the club lounge as we had to attend a seminar at Suntec Convention Centre from 7pm-11pm. I would like to commend Melvin, the check-in agent at the executive lounge who was extremely friendly and courteous. Unlike other hotels we've been to the past, Melvin encouraged us to take the drinks from the fridge for our consumption in the room. As an Ambassador member, we were upgraded to the Deluxe Junior Suite facing the Marina Bay - a spectacular view, and they even returned our 2 Suite Night Awards as they could not offer the best available room at that time.   Room wise was pretty specious but I have to say the work desk isn't functional at all",5
"Everything is great, the concierge Melody was very helpful and courteous, buffet breakfast was wonderful. The only thing to watch for is the check out stations are separated into 4 individual places and there were no organized lines at busy time, some of us tried to form a line but people kept cutting in front to individual cashiers, I had to wait for at least 20 minutes upon checkout because of the confusion.",5
"This place punches way above its weight. We stayed in Premiere Suite in December, it is a lovely suite spacious with comfortable furniture and most importantly ToTo WCs with Waslets/Bidets   Staff is very cordial, I was recognised by name at the time of checkin (we stayed here last year as well), how cool is that! After whole year...  We also stayed at Ritz which is suppose to be superior but in my opinion this is better and also better than Mandarin Oriental...",5
"On our way home to the UK we stayed at the hotel for 3 nights. We had a lovely room and the service was excellent.  The staff were friendly, professional and very helpful.  A special mention is for Hazel who we met in the executive club lounge and who always seemed pleased to see us, was extremely pleasant and helped us with the refreshments which were delicious. Overall a lovely stay.",5
"This is quite a new hotel with a very modern feel. That said the thing that struck me most was the great service.  It seemed at every turn there was another smiling team member eager to provide assistance. The rooms are very nice, a good size and with comfortable beds. The floor on which the gyn, pool and bar are situated is a great place to hand out. The infinity pool which looks over the city is amazing and there are lots of places to just sit and relax and read a book, enjoy a drink or whatever. A convenient location with MRT stations close by plus Suntec for shopping across the road.",5
"Great hotel well situated in the Singapore south beach area, right next to suntec city. Modern stylish rooms and interior. An great pool with an awesome view over the city and marina bay. And lively lounge which feels like a pub at night!;)",5
"We stayed in a ""Premium Marina Bay View room"" for a duration of five nights from December 28th till January 3rd. The appointed room was decent size. The room was also extremely clean and had a vibrant and contemporary design. Being on a high floor, the unobstructed view of the Marina Bay and city view was magnificent,  The service was relatively good even though there was high occupancy during our stay. The service staff, front office and concierge were professional and polite.  We had breakfast at ""Beach Road Kitchen"" and at the club lounge. The breakfast at the ""Beach Road Kitchen"" offered a wide range of Asian and Continental cuisine food with higher standards. We had our evening cocktails at the club lounge which offered a generous and tasty spread. The service was great.  ",5
"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for an overnight stopover for our trip.  Their welcome staff emailed us a few days before our arrival and asked what they can do to make this trip special.  I mentioned that we were celebrating our anniversary. Our flight arrived really early so we went to the hotel and dropped our bags so we can explore the city. By 9am, our room was ready and when we got back at night, there were cake and balloons waiting for us in our room.  The staff at the lounge were very attentive and friendly specially Hazel and Melvin.  Thank you so much for making our Singapore trip, such a wonderful and memorable experience!",5
"The location of the Hotel is ideal in the Marina Bay district, the dining options were plentiful and we had great meals there. Our room was spacious and clean with outstanding views of the harbor. They have this unique NCO club which I think is relatively new with Bars and restaurants attached to the property. The best part of this JW Marriott was the executive lounge. The service and food and beverage options were amazing. Miss Stella Lim, Jacquelyn, Hazel and Camilla were all wonderful to us for our entire stay. We happened to be there over Thanksgiving, couldn’t get in to a restaurant for a traditional Turkey Dinner so Chef Nino made one for us. Stella even gave us a hand-written note of appreciation. I think my wife and I owe them all a note of appreciation for a job well",5
Beautiful hotel located not far from Marina Bay.  Check in was a little slow and disappointing however the hotel is beautiful and stay is first class.  Try and get marina sands view. Breakfast is above the rest and if it had a better view would be perfect.  True reflection of all that Singapore is.  Will definitely recommend this hotel.  Did I mention it is located next to two malls ,4
"After an absence of a year and a half due to the condescending behavior of the previous HM Oliver Sturmayr, we decided to give the property another try.  SUBJECT TO AVAILABILITY even for Lifetime Platinum, we are grateful for the upgrade and SURPRISE SURPRISE! An early check in at 2 pm, unlikely previous stays when rooms were only ready around 4, sometimes 430! Only because Sturmayr was allowing late checkouts to even non member guests. Regulars and MR members at this property, will know, Housekeeping actually has their work cut out for them to turnaround as rooms are literally covered wall to wall with Mirrors.   As always, executive lounge is where we spend most of our time as associates here are like family to us.  Tea time - maybe, menu could vary just a little bit. We",5
"The hotel is located within walking distance of almost everything (sometimes it's a long walk, but doable.) It is very well upkept, clean and modern!! The Executive lounge is top notch with wonderful caring employees -- our thanks to Hazel and Eva for your wonderful, friendly service!!!  Sara at the taxi desk is also a great asset to the hotel. He was very helpful in his suggestions and gave perfect directions and insights on things not to be missed. We will definitely return!!",5
Hazel is kind and lounge have good food room is so good is well I was able to do exercise at the place where the gym was good and the scenery was good. The pool was clean and felt good.  This hotel was very fancy.,5
"We arrived on NYE direct from Australia at 6pm. We were very disappointed to learn our room was not yet ready. This is sub par management from an expensive and exclusive hotel. Management did, however, provide us with a temporary room and gave us access to the executive lounge which provides breakfast, snacks and evening cocktails. This was appreciated as compensation. As for the hotel its 5 star. Friendly staff. Big clean and modern rooms. Heated toilet seats with remote controlled bidet amazed my kids. The pool was great (though a little cool) and the location is unbeatable. ",4
"The hotel is absolutely great for family vacation or business trip. The swimming pool on the sixth floor was awesome and has an absolutely exclusive privacy and has a fantastic view. The fun pool on the 18th floor was amazing with a breathtaking sunset view. We especially love the setting on the 18th floor with lots of entertaining activities for the kids while the adults were able to enjoy the amazing skyline of Singapore. The Madame Fan Restaurant which is the hidden jewel of the historical piece within the property, and the restaurant interior decoration was absolutely stunning.   Our room was always well kept and clean. The amenities were beyond our expectation. The hotel lobby and surrounding area are always kept tidy and well maintained. The hotel staff was always greeting",5
"We checked in New Year's Eve 2019 to Jan 4, 2020. The hotel was fully booked but we had smooth and no line check in &amp; out except for the issue on the miscommunication on the request for our luggages to be brought down everything was seemless.  The attention, service provided by the staffs shout out to Hazel who attended to our request especially to the requests of my child while we enjoyed afternoon tea &amp; hors d'oeuvres at the executive lounge. Hazel always had a smile on her face and ensured she introduced herself prior to offering how she can help make our experience better. Our room reservation came with free buffer breakfast. The spread at Beach Road Kitchen was good and the food is even better. Everything was a hit! I love how the fruits are fresh. Everything was delicious!",5
"1) Service was excellent. Staffs were everywhere to assist you. From the moment we alight from the cab until check in. Benson was outside to usher us from the cab and offered to bring in our baggage followed by WaiYing for the fast processing of checking-in. I missed out the name of the female staff who brought us the lime juice. Though our room was not ready due to our early arrival, we received a call around 215pm that our room was ready. 2) Room 1915 was amazing with fantastic views of the padang, esplanade &amp; Marina Bay Sands (MBS). The 2 pillows - 1 was extreme hard and the other other extreme soft to cater to individual needs.  3) The amenities were great as well. Guests really need to explore the pool on the 6th floor and the gym to experience how good they are.  4) Wifi",5
Perfection in every detail.   Staff is amazing - Jusanna👍👊🙏 - Xas Qin there are room attendants and there is Xas Qin in her own league.  Pool areas👍 Beverly in the Lobby👍  The Gym is amazing   Will come here everytime being in Singapore.   Well done Marriott!!!,5
"My husband and I did a staycation in jw marriott over December, and were really wowed by Muzaffar's kind hospitality. It is truly because of front line heroes like him that helped made our stay a little more pleasant. We hope to visit again and well done Muzaffar and team.",4
"I had a great experience at this hotel-granted there was a very large tour group who were there when I checked in, the Marriott managed to keep me separate, and really made me feel special! The check in was a bit awkward, as my room wasn’t ready @ 3p, but they were nice enough to give me a holding room until mine was ready. Unfortunately, they didn’t warn me when it was, and knocked on my door, and I was completely unprepared to move, then had to wait until they forgot about me, until I had to make it happen myself. I left a personal item in the room, which they said wasn’t there, until I insisted that it was, and it was delivered. Other than this snafu, I had a wonderful stay-great infinity pool area, gym, lounge, etc. I thought everyone who worked there was extremely helpful,",4
There are many hotels in Singapore .i have been staying in many over the last 30 years  But never ever have encountered so many problems in one stay  It’s seems that there is management  but they do not run the hotel or at least not aware whats going on  Checking in .i have asked to upgrade to a suite for sure paying for the upgrade. We got a nice large suite  with dirty shower hair on the floor sleeper out of their plastic cover which meant they were used No fruit basket which is standard Broken guest toilet  and in the living room two chandeliers with many burnt lamps . Mini bar if one consumed one two articles they have not been replenished . All restaurants in the hotel closed at 22.30 so if one wants to it the option he has in this area is to order room service  We ordered,3
"Stayed at JW Marriott Singapore for 9 days over the holiday season with my family. We had a wonderful experience. From the time we arrived at the hotel, Sarah from the guest service team was waiting for us at the entrance and helped us with the check in process. All the staff at the hotel are incredibly warm and friendly which made a huge difference.  All our requests were attended to promptly.  The rooms are very nice, with very modern amenities. Our kids specially enjoyed the high speed internet, the gym and the swimming pools.  Would highly recommend the executive lounge, it has great food and drinks as well as very friendly staff. It is very well located, with multiple MRT stations closeby, great food choices, shopping malls etc., all within a few minutes walk.  Overall, we",5
"I will explain. When I researched the hotel, reviewed pictures I thought I picked a high rise where I can get higher floor rooms to watch the spectacular fireworks and views. But over floor 21, this hotel has residences. So rooms, facilities up to 21st floor. Beautiful pool in pictures was closed for new year eve party. Separate paid event.   I picked two rooms. Not standard, not entry level.. called larger size premium king.. first of all they were both small but one was even smaller. One had a lounge chair allowing 3 kids to share and the other one had barely enough room around the bed. I raised it and was told they are considered same category.   I was trying to be loyal Bonvoy customer but not anymore. You are better off booking from discount sites - better price w better",3
"I stayed at the JW Marriott South Beach for 4 nights in December.  As a Platinum Elite member I was very impressed with the hotel's genuine interest in accommodating preferred guests.    I checked in using the Bonvoy app and noticed that I had been upgraded to an Executive Club King from a deluxe room.  I was grateful for the upgrade but based on my review of TripAdvisor reviews, there had been some complaints about the size of these lower end rooms.  I texted the hotel via the app to see if perhaps I could be put in a corner room or the ""Premier King Larger Guest room"".   They indicated they would check when I arrived to see if that additional upgrade could be accommodated.  When I arrived (which was after 11pm) -- the front desk was really friendly and welcoming.  They",5
"I am greatly impressed with the care and concern of the JW Marriott staff during our short stay with them.  My daughters were unwell and I received an email after asking about them.  While I was there, we were made to feel at home.  I would like to extend my most sincere thanks to all of them for being professional, efficient yet kind and caring. I would also like to take this opportunity to mention Hazel, Nasuha and Ramesh who went out of their way when they realised my daughters were ill to the point that we felt so much at home and with family. Your team made our stay a truly memorable one. Every effort and detail are much appreciated.  The hotel was in a convenient location, near the Merlion, next to Suntec and Raffles City. The hotel has 2 lovely pools and lots of other",5
"Nice hotel but very small room, brakefast very good and the staff very efficient.  Very easy to go anywhere , metro station just by the stairs.  Very clean city but very expensive.  If you are a smoker please consider to pay attention where is the designated are because even you think is outside is forbidden. ",4
"Having stayed at JW Marriott hotels elsewhere unfortunately this one wasn’t quite up to the standard expected.   Staff on their mobiles at reception and disregarding passing guests, breakfast line out the door and around the corner (we gave it a miss on day 1 despite having paid for it) and the breakfast when we finally had it was bland to say the very least.   Disappointing experience. ",3
"I just had a two night stay at this property.  Very centrallyl located. I enjoyed my stay.  My club room was just OK.  Somewhat lacking in personality.  Electricity outlets on either side of the bed didn't work which was problematic.  The desk chair does not roll so it is not easy to move on the carpet.   The bathroom was nice however.  The lounge offering variety was spectacular.  Spoiled for choice in the mornings and the evenings.  They do need to do some work on making sure the ""hot"" foods are actually hot.  Many of the supposed warm breakfast items (mushrooms, sausage, baked beans) were hardly even lukewarm.  They certainly need to be kept much hotter.",4
"The JW Singapore is an outstanding hotel. We have traveled to Singapore multiple times and this is our #1 choice, for business/family travel. We appreciate the warm and friendly welcome, the smiles, and genuine care from the moment we arrive. This JW is well kept, has  stunning views, comfortable modern decor, great pools, spa, wonderful workout facility. The executive lounge has a wide variety of great food, and exceptional service. Hazel is an amazing lady, each time we visit the lounge, she is always smiling, courteous, she has great recommendations,and really goes the extra mile to make sure we have what we need. When my child was sick directed me to the clinic near by to get antibiotics. Thank you Hazel and tall the staff of JW Singapore!",5
"We loved everything about of our stay here.  The hotel is incredibly modern and nice and the staff is attentive to your every need.  Our favorite part was the Executive Lounge happy hour they have for members which was extremely well organized and a place where you could have drinks before dinner.  The breakfast was also delicious.  The spa was one of the best we've ever been too.  Finally, the location was close to many of the destinations you want to go to in the marina.  Would highly recommend!",5
We really liked this hotel. The staff is so friendly and helpful. The rooms and bathrooms are nice and quiet.  It seemed in a very convenient location for everything that we wanted to see will visiting. The breakfast buffet was one of the best ones that we've had in a long time. Well worth the cost.  We stayed 4 nights and then came back for 1 night at the end of our trip before heading to the airport.,5
"I had a great check in experience on the day, I went to one of staff named Lisa which I initially thought was the receptionist to be in charge of the check in process, however Lisa was actually a lobby ambassador and the check in counter was at the other side. She was very helpful and polite, showed and lead the way to the check in counter, upon seeing the counter being busy, she didn’t just leave us there waiting but took the initiative to check in for us which I really see her giving an extra mile in work. On a side note, I even received a hand written card from her upon checked into the room with warm welcome that was really out of my expectation. I really appreciate for whatever she had done, and it really enhances my stay in the hotel. ",5
"If you are looking for a tranquil and yet very close to bustling area this the best place for you. Don't forget to include the access in execute lounge to experience the most hospitable and friendly staff. Thanks to Hazel, Melvin, Vino, Sharmane and for the rest of the gang for ensuring your needs are well attended and to chef Peter and Jessie for the foods. ",5
"My first stay at this Marriott hotel in Singapore for 2 nights, but will not be my last! Great hotel for facilities and location. Staff were very attentive and tried to ensure our stay was very good. Stella in the executive lounge stands out, and should be recongnised in making me feel happy at all times. I am a Marriott ambassador level person, but Stella ensured that I was treated like a king. Would stay again at this hotel the next time I am in Singapore.",5
Ma'am Hazel from the executive lounge is vwry accommodating and ver nice eh. Keep the Good job. And excellent service. The place is very clean and neat. Still special mention to ma'am hazel for good service!,5
"Staff could not have been more helpful.  We arrived early but were given a temporary room to shower etc for a previous engagement.  The rooms were beautiful, comfortable beds, great view of the marina. Pool delightful especially when it was raining.  Will certainly stay there again next time we will book the executive level.",5
"We do quite a bit of traveling around the world and always try to stay in a central location. For this trip we chose to stay at the JW in Singapore and it was the best decision we made, for several reasons. One that it’s central to everything and within walking distance to the Marina, where we caught the NYE fireworks. It is also central the finest dining experiences in the city. Right across the street you can catch the Big Bus Tours that will show you all of Singapore via 4 separate routes.   Now for the hotel itself, the views are out of this world , but the rooms are like any other JW hotels in the Marriott chain, so not much more to say other than it’s always a great night sleep. As for the amenities and the staff, that is a different story. They go well above and beyond to",5
We stayed here over Christmas and the staff here is exceptional. We arrived at 1:00 am on Christmas Day and from the moment we arrived everyone from the front desk to the executive lounge (thank you Hazel for taking such good care of us) was friendly and helpful. The rooms are small but well appointed. The variety of food in both the executive lounge and Beach Road restaurant was fresh and delicious. There was something for everyone.  The location is great to with lots of shops and restaurants and right next to an MRT station.  We also had a fun night at their Cool Cats lounge for live jazz. It’s so nice to visit a place that values their guests. ,5
"I did a booking for a 3d2n stay at the executive club room to usher in the new year only to find that my room key did not work since I arrived at 2.30pm at the premises. Even the porter tried with the master key and it did not work. I was told that the door handle is spoilt and needed about 30mins to repair. So I was ushered to the executive lounge to have tea, and was told that I will be informed when my room is ready. 30mins went by, I finished my tea and still no one came to tell me that my room was ready. I approached the counter at the lounge and a staff helped me to check, only to be told that it's taking an even longer time to rectify the fault. I then decided to head out instead of wasting my time waiting around. This was already 4pm. As my schedule was mixed up, I",1
"WE stayed for four nights and it was an excellent stay for the family with wide choice of food, location, touring and leisure. The scenic enviornment of the hotel with lush facade and close proximity to the Esplanade, Bay of the Gardens and Sun tech city Mall added to our experience and enjoyment of the stay",5
"I went to Singapore with my husband and my parents. We had booked 2 rooms and we used suites upgrade credits which we were lucky enough to be upgraded to two junior suites on the 13th floor. The rooms were spacious (with 1.5 bathroom) and had lots of storage spaces. The rooms had modern amenities and lots of mirrors. The view from the bedroom was excellent. We can see the light show from our room. The service was excellent. We had access to the lounge and there were plenty of snacks, food and drinks. The buffet breakfast at the restaurant was a must do if you are pondering that. The location was excellent; you can walk from the hotel to Merlion Park. We were pondering about staying here vs. on orchard road and we went with this one which is the right decision. We didn’t use any",5
"We just had a staycation and loved every moment of it. We opt to include the executive lounge access and were granted afternoon tea, cocktails and snacks in the evening and a lovely breakfast the next day. Prior to check in, i had stated few requests via my Marriott Bonvoy and was delighted to have these acceded to by Ms. Sarah Lorenzo. Her friendly and professional demeanour truly set the tone for our stay and our 2 boys simply adored her! She suggested the best pool to use, and recommended where we could shop nearby. We were also given kids’ amenities and shown where to get complimentary candies at the lobby. Even the day sofa in our club room was converted to sleeping bed for the kids! Knowing i had some documents to print, she took me to the business lounge. Nothing was too",5
"The hotel is strategically located near major shopping malls such as Suntec City, Raffles City and Marina Square.  Therefore finding places to shop and eat is not an issue at all.  The hotel staff are professional and friendly, and the check-in and checkout process is a breeze.  The facilities are new, with an outdoor pool and gym.  The views are amazing overlooking the marina bay skyline.  However the room feels small and the door needs a hard push to open and a tap with the card in order to close properly. ",4
"We did family staycation on 24-25th Dec. One night stay, totally worth it. The staff is really welcoming. There are restaurants/ pubs nearby. Good for family. Suntec ( mall) just opposite. If you need anything for kids also it’s just 5 mins walk away. The breakfast spread was really good. From salads, fruits, continental , Chinese and Indian dishes were available. Overall I would highly recommend. Fit for family.",5
"It's my second time I stayed in JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach and I am always excited to come back. The check in process was very smooth and quick.

"This is by far one of the best vacations I have taken and many thanks goes towards this gorgeous hotel.  The staff is very professional, caring and friendly.  The rooms are very clean and exactly what you would expect from a 5-star hotel.  The food and beverage services are bewildering.   If you are planning on staying at this hotel, trust that you will be well looked after and cared for. You are about to have great memories of Singapore.    ",5
"I recently stayed at JW Marriott Singapore South Beach (December 21-23rd) for a business trip.  I stayed with a colleague named Taisha Walker.  When we order in-room dining, we were greeted by Ramesh P.  He was extremely polite, helpful and welcoming!  He provided us with a list of activities to do while we were in Singapore.  We did all of the items on his list and enjoyed every minute of it!  He also wrote us a very kind and thoughtful note and he displayed high value client service!  Ramesh is a great addition to your team and it really made our stay relaxing and wonderful!    Additionally we did have the opportunity to visit the Tonic bar where we were lucky to have Koshi as our bartender.  Koshi is such a pleasure to speak with her and her drinks were awesome!  Taisha and I",5
We stayed 5 nights with my family  in JW and I can not say enough good words about staff and service.  They went above and beyond to make our stay so comfortable and memorable.  I can thank enough Melvin to make the entire family feel  so special.  The entire staff and manager Jacky was very professional and worm at the same time.  5 star  hospitality.  ,5
"The staff at the executive lounge made our visit memorable at the hotel.  Melvin, what an amazing person. Thank you.  We will recommend this hotel not just it's a great property, Hazel, Rose and the rest of the staff. Just great.  ",5
Well located hotel across the street from the raffles. Decor very Avant garde or almost psychedelic. That may not suit everybody. Ultra modern but no local charm. Rooms on the small side. Friendly efficient staff. Good if on business or short layover in town. Lacks the local charm or atmosfer of Singapore,3
"My original choice of hotels for my holiday trip to Singapore was the Ritz Carlton. It wasn’t available for my dates so I chose the JWMarriott in SouthBeach so I can stay at a Bonvoy hotel and also be near the Marina. I am SO glad the Ritz was not available. This hotel is the most hospitable and welcoming that I’ve ever stayed in abroad. Besides the amazing central location, the staff is impeccable!! They welcome you with open arms, genuine warmth and friendliness that is like no other regardless if you are traveling alone like me, on business or part of a large family. The staff at the front desk, concierge, spa and most memorable, the executive lounge were truly outstanding. They helped make my amazing experience in Singapore these past 6 days even more incredible and I will",5
I was there for a staycation. And I love the service from the staff. The attention to details were great. Kudos to the lobby staff. I would like to mention Elaine who helped us with our check in and directed us to spa place as we were closing on our time. Another to highlight was the spa crew that were working on the 20th Dec. They returned my lost watch to me. In all I had a great experience. I would head back to JW Marriott again,5
I stay at the JW Marriott Singapore four times a year for work.  This hotel continuously out performs all other Marriotts with the attentive staff and clean rooms.  I will only stay at the JW Marriott when I visit Singapore.,5
My wife and I had a wonderful three-day stay. Hotel staff were incredibly hospitable. Chief Chef Arjun and Concierge Matin were especially helpful. The food and service in the Executive Lounge were truly first-class. Highly recommended!,5
"Dined at Akira Back and Madam Fan at The NCO club - amazing food and service.  Thank you to Luna Bajracharya, Hotel Manager who helped my friends to make the bookings at these 2 restaurants. She also ensured that the we were well looked after in the 2 restaurants. A big thank you to Shaun and Grace who served us at Akira  Back  and Lawrence Fu, restaurant General Manager.  They very kindly recommended signature dishes which were excellent in their restaurants.",5
"My husband and I had a memorable staycation on 17Dec 2019. From the minute we stepped foot into the hotel, the service and ambience was truly a cut above others. We were delighted to be offered an upgrade to a premier room with the Marina Bay view and the view was just spectacular on the 19th floor! And the breakfast at Beach Road Kitchen - what could I say - the spread was amazing! But I was most grateful and touched, by the kind act of the housekeeping team, who found and returned my anniversary ring which I had carelessly left in my hotel room. My heartfelt thanks to the staff of JW Marriott Singapore! Thank you for a most memorable stay!",5
"We stayed over at JW Marriott Singapore South Beach for a short staycation and we were pleasantly delighted by the staff's immense dedication to service and their passion in their work. The executive lounge staff never failed to come by our table frequently to check in with us and offer to assist in improving our experience, even going as far as to take the extra mile in serving us drinks and taking multiple photos for us despite us only requesting one, and all of these were done even though such actions were not necessarily a must for them to out their effort into. It really goes to show how service oriented the hotel is, and it really far outstrips any and every single other hotel stay we've had in Singapore because the staff really made us not just feel welcome, but truly at",5
"We were in Singapore on holiday for five days and stayed at this hotel.  We had only good experiences starting with check in.  Our check in host was Guan Xian and he continued to provide excellent service throughout our stay.  It’s always nice to have staff greet you by name and remember the details of previous conversations.  Guan really delivered in this respect all the way thru up to and including our departure.     The room was nice, clean and in perfect working order.  Our housekeeping attendant, Li Yan, was also exceptional.  We had brief conversations with him daily and he always provided some simple added benefits like lens tissues, extra water and even more towels than the extras we had already requested.  He also worked with us to clean our room around our schedule,",5
"We received a very warm welcome from the doorman and the receptionist. Estelle from call center was also very helpful and willing to assist with enquiries. The room was very clean and the housekeeper, Robin who cleaned our room also left a note in our room and left us with lens cleanser as we maintain the room cleanliness. Thank you for the service provided, it was a very enjoyable stay!",5
